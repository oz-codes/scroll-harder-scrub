15,01the following has nothing to do with 28 nude mexicans.


15,01in the year 2155, a mad polish scientist created an intelligent toilet.
15,01the toilet was fluent in over 3 languages, could walk, run, read, write,
15,01smoke, and identify toasters from over 50 kilometers away.  it was in other
15,01words THE PERFECT WEAPON.

15,01in the year 2156 the toilet beat sergei khrakov at snakes and ladders.

15,01in the year 2157 it won the gold medal at the international synchronized 
15,01swimming championships in nigeria.

15,01in the year 2161 the toilet grew a penis, a vagina, and a pair of buttocks.
15,01the scientific community was puzzled.

15,01in the year 2162 the toilet began to reproduce.

15,01in the year 2164 nothing happened at all.

15,01in the year 2175 again, nothing happened.

15,01in the year 2177 an army of 50,000 toilets invaded turkey, thus starting a
15,01war between the two most powerful nations on earth - sri lanka and norway.
15,01madagascar immediately responded by nuking scotland, which in turn prompted
15,01bosnia to invade northern japan.  it was in other words the beginning of 
15,01THE FOURTH WORLD WAR.

15,01(note to reader: the third world war lasted 5 minutes, during which an
15,01                 extremely intoxicated american army unsuccessfully tried 
15,01                 to invade the pacific ocean. )

15,01in the year 2184 the war was over.  the toilets, from their secret base in
15,01the antarctic systematically executed all remaining forms of life on the 
15,01planet, thus becoming the only sentient form of life on earth.

15,01in the year 2185 a revolutionary kind of soap was invented.

15,01in the year 2186 the toilets started construction on their first city, the
15,01big crapper.

15,01in the year 2189 an even more advanced kind of soap was invented.

15,01in the year 2190 the big crapper was complete.  it housed over 800,000 
15,01toilets, and was expanding every day.

15,01in the year 2245 there were over 50 toilet cities on the earth, and the 
15,01toilet population reached 90 billion.

15,01in the year 2248 the first toilet olympics were held.

15,01in the year 2250 the last blender was held - all blenders and other kitchen
15,01appliances on the planet were either executed or put in work camps.

15,01in the year 2255 the kitchen appliance alliance was formed.  it consisted 
15,01of over 20 million rebel blenders, ovens, toasters, and vibrators.

15,01(note to reader: vibrators are naturally not a kitchen appliance, but in
15,01                 the future they are an essential part of the complete
15,01                 breakfast. )

15,01in the year 2264 the k.a.a. successfully took control of the toilet capital,
15,01the big crapper.  the toilets surrendered.  a free state for kitchen 
15,01appliances was formed under the 'taco bell accord'.  it was the year of
15,01many sexual encounters.

15,01in the year 2269 somebody glued one thing to another.  this of course lead
15,01to the inevitable - the end of the world.  


15,01this is, as us authors call it, "the end" of the story, meaning that the
15,01story is over, which of course means that it's over.  of course, this
15,01signifies that the story is over, which in turn lets the reader know - the
15,01reader being you, that the story has in fact ended.
