15,01Twilight

15,01The order has ruled these lands for too long
15,01We need someone to deliver us, somebody strong
15,01The dream of freedom, many feel we should drop it
15,01After being deceived by so many false prophets
15,01Men who claimed they could bring about our deliverance
15,01Fled the first time they met the belligerants
15,01As quickly as these "saviors" arose, much quicker did they fall
15,01THe old order, not being destroyed, was left there standing tall
15,01Days pass and the order still rules, looking down from it's pedastal's top
15,01Until one day a new breed is born, truly a powerful crop
15,01The order is scared so they take the new blood as their own
15,01Although happy at first, the new breed decides to disown
15,01So they band together and form a tribe intent on ruling the land
15,01They have the support of all those tired of the order's iron hand
15,01Slowly but surely much power they gain, and soon are winning the fight
15,01Our only chance for freedom is now, the Messiah is in the form of Twilight
