15,01                            ..G.M.

15,01The first touch,
15,01our hands trembling and sweating.
15,01The touch was instantanenous,
15,01but lasted a lifetime.
15,01Slowly our hands entwined,
15,01fingers caressing each others palms.
15,01Oh,
15,01what bliss.
15,01Slowly our heads turned,
15,01our eyes meet,
15,01my heart pounds,
15,01and the sweat begins to pour off my brow.
15,01We gaze into each others eyes for an eternity,
15,01and then....
15,01It starts.
15,01little by little,
15,01our heads move tward each other.
15,01Her eyes close,
15,01and our lips touch.
15,01We sit,
15,01embraced,
15,01our bodies sweating,
15,01pressed against each other tightly.
15,01My lips,
15,01crushed against hers,
15,01and hers against mine,
15,01our fluids mixing,
15,01our bodies clutching.
15,01My hand runs across her face fleetingly,
15,01her hand slowly runs along my chest.
15,01Slowly,
15,01gently,
15,01passionatly,
15,01I start to kill her lips,
15,01my hands continuing to caress her face and neck.
15,01Slowly I kiss around her mouth,
15,01my tounge slowly caressing her lips.
15,01In time my passion wanders,
15,01my hands slowly start to caress her back,
15,01soon they wander back to run through her hair.
15,01Slowly I start to kiss her chin,
15,01her hands continuning to caress my chest and back,
15,01her nails cutting into my body delightfully,
15,01her breath making love to my ear.
15,01My mouth strays and I kiss her neck,
15,01My mouth savouring the tast,
15,01my tounge caressing her flesh.
15,01Gently I bite her,
15,01and she jumps,
15,01letting a small squek escape.
15,01Her nails dig into my back,
15,01and I pull her in even tighter.
15,01I move back up to kiss her,
15,01our bodies clutching despratly to each other,
15,01the force is crushing,
15,01yet gentle.
15,01And we linger,
15,01for eternity we linger,
15,01tounges entertwining,
15,01our hands frantic to caress each other,
15,01our passion crushing us.
15,01And she pulls away.
15,01Fleetingly she touches my hand,
15,01she smiles.
15,01She tells me that she's going to bed,
15,01and I am going to sleep in the room on down.
15,01I smile back,
15,01and steal a kiss.
15,01She leaves,
15,01closing the door.
15,01and I sit down to cry.
15,01as the tears run donw my face I think to myself.
15,01I was expecting the guest room,
15,01yet that was not the problem.
15,01But my last kiss,
