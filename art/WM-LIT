15,01                     I see the world edge on.
15,01                     it's like playing god for ants
15,01                     or being here and gone.

15,01                     it's that annoying telephone ringing, ringing
15,01                     at four a.m. incessantly.
15,01                     a tack on your seat pricking, stinging.

15,01                     But only to see the world edge on
15,01                     is such a joyous sight.
15,01                     besides all that obnoxious noise that
15,01                     always fills my head.

15,01                     Burning, boiling my mind away.
15,01                     leaving to rest in the soil....

15,01                As i sit, my eyes propped open,
15,01                   i watch
15,01                   dreadful things
15,01                   flashing
15,01                   flashing
15,01                   across my screen

15,01                I am told it's for my own good.
15,01                But what do they know.

15,01                Watching that illusory dream
15,01                   blinking off
15,01                   and on
15,01                   and off again
15,01                   leaving me empty once again
15,01                   i dream softly

15,01                I sit on that soft sofa
15,01                watching for hours and hours.
