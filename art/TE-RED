15,01                               "The Red Place"

15,01        I was looking for a job.  I walking down Main Street, handing out 
15,01resumes in places I think I could work.  I had no real qualifications, so I 
15,01thought that with some luck the best job I could get would be to be a cashier 
15,01in some store.  With no luck, I would end up washing dishes.  But luck wasn't 
15,01there at all since it seemed that nobody needed me to wash their cutlery or 
15,01collect their money.  I was still strolling on Main Street when I got to that 
15,01building.   People were painting it in red, and it was obviously having some 
15,01other repairs as well.  I didn't remember what was there before, so it 
15,01probably was some sort of house they were converting into a store of 
15,01something.  All the windows were covered with newspaper, except with the 
15,01door's window, which was covered with the following ad:

15,01        The Red Place -- Leftier than your ordinary cafe

15,01        We mean to be a gathering for all kind of revolutionary people. We are 
15,01        looking for people to work in our coffeehouse.  If you are interested, 
15,01        come meet us at 331, East 4th avenue and we will discuss some way to 
15,01        fit you in our staff.

15,01Looks like all my luck was hiding there.  Working in the soon-to-be coolest 
15,01place in town was something I couldn't refuse, so I headed up to 4th avenue.

15,01        The place was a private home.  I knocked, and was promptly welcomed in 
15,01by some charming 20-something girl.  She knew what I was coming for, so she 
15,01led me to the living room and asked me to wait for a moment.  She came back 
15,01with a guy and another girl, and I knew I would be interviewed.  We talked 
15,01some time about my past working experiences, and then the conversation drifted 
15,01to my political beliefs, and theirs.  They wanted to be part of a new wave of 
15,01worker resistance to the global crisis the common people had to face and help 
15,01foster it.  Anyway, I got a job waiting for tables and was very happy.

15,01        The job was kinda easy.  The place wasn't getting many customers at 
15,01first, but when people caught on that there was a good place where people with 
15,01open minds would be welcomed, lots of them came.  Punk bands came to sing at 
15,01The Red Place, and political gurus were crashing on the class system.  They 
15,01were really fostering a new movement of protestation and we were getting some 
15,01wide publicity in the city.  Newspapers were talking about us: the city 
15,01council was worried, some gang fights between nazi skins and punks happened 
15,01often at the end of shows just outside the coffeehouse, but nothing really 
15,01bad..  Just the normal reactions from stuck up people.

15,01        But then came The Night.  "Losers R Us" were playing a great set, and 
15,01big crowd was inside.  Not before long, tho, there also was a big crowd 
15,01OUTSIDE. I first thought that once again, skins decided to kick some butt, but 
15,01before long I understood what was going on.  A special CIA task force entered, 
15,01armed to the teeth.  

15,01        "WE'RE CLOSING THIS THING DOWN, YOU COMMIE BASTARDS!@"

15,01        Nobody bothered to listen to them, the band continued to play, and 
15,01before anybody could do anything, they gave a whole new meaning to the name of 
15,01our coffehouse.
