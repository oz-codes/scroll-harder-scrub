15,01Acid
15,01~~~~

15,01A little acid does a lot
15,01It makes you crazy, believe it or not
15,01If I do it, knowing me,
15,01I'll forever suffer for all to see

15,01And so I try it, despite what they say
15,01Another night, another day
15,01And instantly my thoughts are changed
15,01My head feels as if rearranged

15,01And gently, gently my powers get weaker
15,01My mind is clear, my thoughs are bleaker
15,01I close my eyes and fall asleep
15,01My insanity is all I keep.

15,01Desperately, I search around
15,01When suddenly, I hear a sound
15,01It was coming from my open door
15,01Louder than a lions roar

15,01I step off my bed and into the air
15,01Where I collide with my evil stare
15,01Struggling to open my eyes
15,01Repeatedly, I feel my lies

15,01Gradually, my soul decays
15,01Not even remain my evil ways
15,01A morbid laugh rings in my ears
15,01When a beautiful lady licks my tears

15,01My door falls closed and my floor erased
15,01Who can blame me with what I've faced
15,01I have seen the devil's face
15,01And now I fall at my disgrace

15,01Willingly, I took the pain
15,01Like getting hit by a moving train
15,01And now I suffer, but it's not done
15,01Because now the fight has just begun

15,01Trying to grab my sanity back,
15,01I close my eyes and fade to black
15,01I reach above and grab my soul
15,01And then I fall in my eternal hole

15,01As I'm falling, I open my eyes
15,01But all I see is endless lies
15,01When suddenly I feel pain again
15,01Like getting punched by thirty men

15,01As you see, I'm not a liar
15,01My thoughts were rare, my clothes on fire
15,01All this happened in my mind
15,01As I exit from way behind

15,01If I knew north from south or west
15,01I wouldn't be like all the rest;
15,01Lying here, upon my mind
15,01Lies Satan's treaty which I had signed

15,01Satanic laughter fills the air
15,01Was this the drug or my nightmare?
15,01I try to fight it, but it's too hard.
15,01When suddenly, I lose my guard

15,01As suddenly I feel a blade
15,01in my chest which I had made
15,01Mourning for my soul again
15,01I close my eyes and count to ten

15,01When I awaken, I am almost dead
15,01Still lying on my little bed
15,01Tears drip slowly from my face
15,01As I see my blood all over the place

15,01In my hand, I see the knife
15,01Which soon will have taken my precious life
