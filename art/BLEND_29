15,01Quick Thinker

15,01A customer asked a new clerk in a supermarket if she could buy half a
15,01grapefruit. Not knowing what to do, the clerk excused himself to ask
15,01the manager.  "Some nut out there wants to buy half a grapefruit--" he
15,01began, and suddenly realized that the customer had entered the office
15,01behind him--"and this lovely lady would like to buy the other half."
15,01The manager was impressed with the way the clerk amicably resolved the
15,01problem and they later started chatting. "Where are you from?" asked
15,01the store manager.  "Lancaster, Pennsylvania," replied the clerk, "Home
15,01of ugly women and great hockey teams."  "Oh? My wife is from
15,01Lancaster!" challenged the manager.  Without skipping a beat, the clerk
15,01asked, "What team was she on?"
15,01*****************************************************

15,01Bill and Marla decided that the only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon
15,01quickie with their ten-year-old son in the apartment was to send him out on
15,01the balcony and order him to report on all the neighborhood activities.

15,01The boy began his commentary as his parents put their plan into operation.
15,01"There's a car being towed from the parking lot," he said. An ambulance just
15,01drove by."  A few moments passed.  "Looks like the Anderson's have company,"
15,01he called out, "Matt's riding a new bike and the Cooper's are having sex."

15,01Mom and Dad shot up in bed.  "How do you know that?" the startled father
15,01asked.

15,01"Their kid is standing out on the balcony too," his son replied.
