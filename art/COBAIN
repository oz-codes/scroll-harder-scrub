00,01Endless Nirvana  14- 00Dedicated to Kurt Cobain 1966 14. 001994 14-

00,01I don't know why I'm on this earth,
00,01Why my mother's given birth.
00,01Why I cannot face my fears,
00,01Why I'm afraid to shed my tears.

00,01The devils inside me are taking their toll,
00,01I've got one friend, my rock and roll.
00,01But even that haunts me the same,
00,01As I cannot shake unwanted fame.

00,01I must do this for the pain to cease,
00,01And finally be alone in peace.
00,01I know my death's already forseen,
00,01My heaven, nirvana, my ultimate dream.
