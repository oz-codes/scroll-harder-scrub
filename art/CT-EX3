15,01The Experiment - Part 3

15,01(note - what happened to part two?)

15,01Well, I am currently developing on material contained within part two with
15,01Eoanya. And, so as not to spoil the surprise, I'll release the experiment AND
15,01the finished product next month, for those who would be interested in the
15,01process. If you aren't... what are you doing reading lit anyway? 8)
15,01Anyway, this part three contains three timed writings, and an amalgamate poem
15,01created using parts of all three writings. I'll get to that when it comes.


15,015 minute timed writing on... Teeth.
15,01Go.

15,01Teeth. How I love my teeth. O where wouldst I be without my pair of 
15,01choppers? I wouldn't be very happy eating nothing but applesauce through a 
15,01straw every day, so I'd better take good care of them. Teeth are so smooth 
15,01to the tip of my tongue as it lovingly caresses my molars in search of 
15,01misplaced peanut butter cookie crumbs. They also make a neat clicking sound 
15,01when I snap them. Teeth are made of enamel, but pottery is often coated with
15,01enamel. Do they melt down people's teeth to coat thrown pots? Is that what 
15,01the highest setting on the kilns are for? But, the quantities of enamel 
15,01used.. fantastic amounts. Yet, sculpture boasts enamel, works of art, 
15,01engraved furniture in the Vatican. Do people in heaven have teeth? Is the 
15,01door in St. Peter's comparable to the one in Paradise, the Pearly Gates 
15,01being made of Pearly Whites?

15,01(it's amazing what your mind will think up when you only have 5 minutes)

15,01Timed writing: Water, 5 minutes.
15,01Go.

15,01Water. My skull is filled with water, almost to the top. It empties itself 
15,01every time I cry. This is also used in the nervous system, being squirted 
15,01out of my cranium and into my spinal chord through a system of transparent 
15,01pneumatic aqueducts made of a very thin membrane. The reason people wear 
15,01bike helmets is so if they crash their head won't pop and empty itself onto 
15,01the street. It it was removed properly, it could be used as a macabre water 
15,01balloon to play a sick joke on someone. There is a small layer of air...

15,01(just call me Mister Water Balloon)

15,015 minute timed writing on Green.
15,01Go.

15,01Green. The speckled mottled smooth green hide of a gecko glistens with vital 
15,01juices of the beetle which the ravenous reptile is in the process of 
15,01extracting from its hard, black, dull iron carapace. With a screech of metal 
15,01the insect submits, and the gecko inserts alligator clips into the twisted 
15,01and warped opening in the armor of the beetle. Draining the beetle's vital 
15,01energy reserve, the metallic monstrocity glows with excess energy, 
15,01headlights flashing and the wipers flopping erraticly. With a shuddering 
15,01squeal, the beetle's hood popped open, and the green dragon robot stomped 
15,01away from the VW, rumbling off in a pool of oil.

15,01(for dense people 8) - note the pun on beetle)


15,01All right... this is the poem part. We underlined all the words/phrases that
15,01we considered "neat".... arranged them. Using only the words we chose, we had
15,01to construct an image. We were allowed to repeat words and to mix them, but
15,01not to add any of our own... 

15,01Using the phrases:

15,01This
15,01Excess energy
15,01Squeal
15,01The ravenous
15,01Teeth, how I love by
15,01O where wouldst I be without my
15,01through a straw
15,01tip of my tongue lovingly caresses my
15,01in search of
15,01Do they melt down people's
15,01Is that what... are?
15,01fantastic amounts
15,01engraved furniture in heaven
15,01being squirted out of my cranium
