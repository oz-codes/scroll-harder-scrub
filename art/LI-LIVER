15,01Luminescant liver spots on my kneecap


15,01  Walking home to his 940th story apartment, Julius wondered silently to
15,01himself if it was really worth it.

15,01  A passing stranger turned to him and said, "No, it isn't!"

15,01  Julius hauled out his revolver, which all New Yorkers are required to carry
15,01by necessity, if not by law and shot the stranger.  If there's one thing he
15,01hated, it was a telepath.

15,01  So, his deep metaphysical thought path derailed, Julius went on a murderous
15,01rampage.  He was trying to cut down, but this was his fourth this week.

15,01  Pizza.  Julius wanted pizza.  So, rather than go home and order it, he
15,01stopped in at the local Domino's.  The pizza tasted so bad that Julius had
15,01puked for 1/2 hour before he even tasted it.  He kissed the cook with his vomit
15,01breath and happily skipped home.  He was beaten to death twice for walking like
15,01a faggot.  I mean, this IS New York.

15,01  Julius' left arm was suddenly drafted into the American rowing team so he was
15,01forced to do things with his right hand, which, being left-handed would
15,01normally have fallen on the left to perform.

15,01  Shooting was a challenge.  He ended up wounding the 7-11 clerk when he robbed
15,01the place.  He felt bad at only wounding him.  It's not right to make animals
15,01suffer.  So he stuffed Habib into the slurpee machine to drown him.  Now, it's
15,01not what you're thinking.  Habib is white.  It's just that his parents always
15,01knew he'd grow up to be a 7-11 clerk so they gave him an Iranian name.

15,01  After he got home the following month, after climbing 939 flights of stairs
15,01(he felt guilty about being such a lazy bastard and taking the elevator for
15,01that last floor), he decided to read the Bible while sipping some brandy and
15,01smoking crack.

15,01  After reading for some time, he came to the conclusion that his right hand
15,01DID in fact offend him.  However, he no longer had a left hand to chop it off
15,01with.  So, being the resourceful little boy scout all American lads should be,
15,01he grasped a thread in his shirt sleeve with his teeth, and tightened it around
15,01his arm.  Eventually, the circulation was cut off, and the arm began to rot.

15,01  In this state, he was really beginning to wonder if the murderous rampages
15,01were worth the trouble.  Firing a revolver with your teeth, after all, is no
15,01easy task.

15,01  However, identifying a mass murderer with one dead arm shooting people with a
15,01gun in his mouth IS an easy task.

15,01  So, as he sat in the police station waiting for the witnesses to pick him out
15,01of the group, he giggled at the officers' attempts to handcuff him.  The right
15,01arm was now so dead that when they did cuff it, it just fell off anyway.

15,01  When he eventually got up to be identified, the witnesses failed to spot him,
15,01because they thought that their attacker had at least one arm.  Julius now had
15,01none.  They ended up convicting 98-year old Mrs. Pickering of Manhattan.  It
15,01was okay though, because Mrs. Pickering deserved the death penalty.  She sent
15,01money to television evangelists, which kept their shows running.

15,01  Julius was so happy that he grew new arms out of sheer joy.

15,01  He used these arms to beat himself about the face and neck with jagged pieces
15,01of glass, such as broken bottles and dead poodles.  They're made of glass, you
15,01know.  Just REAL soft glass.

15,01  This is the way the Hungarians celebrate St. Anchovy's Day.  Julius was not
15,01Hungarian.  He did eat a lot of sausage, however.

15,01  Julius then went home and watched every single episode of MacGyver, which he
15,01had on videotape.  Then he built a tank from things he had lying around the
15,01kitchen and invaded Quebec.

15,01  Quebec, being of French blood, immediately surrendered.  Julius, being easily
15,01annoyed by cowardice, shot himself with his own tank cannon to show them what a
15,01real man is made of.  Apparently, as they all saw, a real man is made up of
15,01some bones, lots of blood, a bunch of muscles and a strange assortment of
15,01internal organs.

15,01  Well, by this point, Julius was getting pretty exhausted, so his scattered
15,01parts settled down for a little nap.  He woke up to find that most of his vital
