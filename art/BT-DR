09,01 I 03have a death wish,
03,01   written all over my face
03,01   who's called the phone bill
03,01   and is headed this way.

03,01  09Today, 03when I finally get home from school
03,01    to cap off an already terrible day,
03,01    will be a letter from Nynex,
03,01    telling me to pay.

03,01   09Their 03plans are so great,
15,01     03they even let me choose my way to die
15,01     03after I tell them I can't pay
15,01     03or if they catch me in a lie.

03,01    09I 03can either take a piece of string,
15,01      03which they supply of course,
15,01      03that will connect a brick and my feet,
15,01      03as I take a swim,
15,01      03in the fishy fishy deep.

15,01     09Or 03I can choose to get caned,
15,01       03like that kid in some country
15,01       03whose government is wacked
15,01       03That'll teach the fucker!,
15,01       03to ever live in a country 
15,01       03that's not even on the map.

15,01      09So, 03as I sort through the mail,
15,01        03with terror and fright,
15,01        03I just hope a heart attack,
15,01        03doesn't take my life.

15,01       09For 03it would be so sad,
15,01         03for me to go,
15,01         03but not a second before,
15,01         03I give 09Death Row 03one last call...
