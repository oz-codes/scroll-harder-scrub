15,01There was a time she loved me true, as if I were a King
15,01And all I had to do was ask, and she'd do anything
15,01Alas the change upon her fell, one dark, bright spring day
15,01And now we are as strangers, she's nothing kind to say
15,01I feared at first that I had erred, but nothing could I find
15,01That I had done that would quite explain, the state of her dark mind
15,01And so we went on close yet distant, no touching of our souls
15,01The aching of my heart went on, and her anger was like coals
15,01In morning light she was merely sad, but as the day grew long
15,01Her thoughts like air unto small flame, did spur that anger on
15,01By evening time, her fury stood, a monument to hate,
15,01Between us almost palpably, her bitterness so great
15,01And so one morning, finally, I asked her for some reason,
15,01Not wanting to go on like that, throughout another season.

15,01"I know not how to say this, I have pondered it so long,
15,01but I no longer feel that love that used to be so strong.
15,01I feel so empty in my heart, with nothing left to give,
15,01To you who are so good to me, I don't deserve to live.
15,01I cry when you are gone from me, I know I am not fair,
15,01Then seeing you with wounded soul, it is too much to bear.
15,01I know not what to do, and grow angry with myself,
15,01You have so much love inside, being wasted on the shelf.
15,01This anger is not for you, no it is for my life,
15,01I wanted so to please you, to be a your loving wife.
15,01A wife should love her husband, with all her soul and heart,
15,01I have failed you so completely, almost from the start.  
15,01How do I release you when you do not want to go?
15,01And how can I forgive myself, when I have hurt you so?"   

15,01So then I knew, and then I cried, for she was all I loved,
15,01My life became a dreary thing, no sunshine from above.
15,01When I thought her anger was for me, I hoped that I might cure it,
15,01But once the truth from her lips spilled, no more could I endure it.
15,01I told her that I understood, and then I set her free,
15,01And though she has been gone a while, a part remains with me.
15,01Some days are dark as midnight, some only slightly gray,
15,01And every eve I think of her, and of our finest day.
15,01The day we became man and wife, my heart was filled with gladness,
15,01Now alone, without her here, I'm filled with utter sadness.
15,01The only thing to which I cling, I keep in a big tin box,
15,01And I alone can gaze at it, when I remove the locks.
15,01It is my prize possession, a sentimental fool I be,
15,01I had to let her go, and yet, she's still here with me.
15,01When day is done, and I miss her most, before I go to bed,
15,01I open up the big tin box, and I drop-kick her head.
