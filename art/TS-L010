15,01        Casting nets

15,01From a distance I watched him
15,01Taming the sea's own fury.
15,01Eluding her taunting movements,
15,01Undaunted by her own passions.

15,01Slowly he casts his nets,
15,01Like strands of silver they were.
15,01Silently falling to the sea,
15,01A lifeline to his soul.

15,01For an eternity he waited
15,01Sitting on his bobbing boat.
15,01His thoughts are lost,
15,01To the sea before him.

15,01How can a man live his life,
15,01In a world of utter silence
15,01A world uncaring and free
15,01How I envy him.
