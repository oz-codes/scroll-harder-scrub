15,01Melting Amor


15,01Melting sun falling,
15,01Tear stained fingers caress
15,01The face...
15,01Her soul
15,01Hides deep in the badlands.

15,01Children wailing through the artic freeze,
15,01Gropeing deaf, blind, and dumb
15,01Through the killing fields,
15,01Time has no signifigance here,
15,01The only sound is the unity of our 
15,01   beating hearts-

15,01Vile smells permeate through, 
15,01Pain never had such a forimable enemy...
15,01The bombs and rockets bursting in air,
15,01War, famine, for a soul must bear...
15,01All is fair in love and war-


15,01                                Mister E. [CiA]
