15,01Title: the ultra-romantic semi-autobiographical tell-all story of me. (c)

15,01how much does it weigh?
15,01absolutely nothing
15,01makes sense in this world anymore.
15,01sanity is like an incredibly over-priced drug.
15,01a drug that only the economically elite can afford.
15,01only the richest of the rich, or the bums who ask for spare change on your
15,01walk to the corner store to buy milk, are able to own this drug.
15,01they inject it into their veins at regular times of the day. they follow some
15,01kind of white line drawn on a piece of black paper that leads out the paths of
15,01their lives, telling them what to do, when to do it, and most importantly...
15,01who to do it to/with.
15,01left
15,01is the socially un-elite.
15,01joe blow, who doesn't blow because he's too homophobic to explore his own
15,01sexuality.
15,01jane doe, who, i'm sure, doesn't have a fluffy tale, four legs, antlers, and
15,01the head of a deer.
15,01the only drug they can afford doesn't really give much of a buzz.
15,01it's more of a downer, something that numbs their minds.
15,01leaves their head blank of all thoughts.
15,01self-preservation and suicide are melded together into a single, more tastey,
15,01less filling, beer.

15,01sex, i'm positive, is very enjoyable to those who want to be pleasured.
15,01people who want to have the feeling of another persons body pressed closely
15,01to their sweat covered pulsating torso,
15,01they have all the fun.
15,01animal
15,01mindless
15,01just pure instinct takes over.
15,01another drug, something a kin to LSD.
15,01it opens your mind up completely, every thought that you have during true
15,01animal
15,01sex is a very pure thought.
15,01it may not be a very in depth thought, but it is pure.

15,01just nothing has any coherence anymore.
15,01random
15,01thoughtless
15,01brain-storming
15,01of yawns that have no meaning to anyone else but yourself.
15,01deep inside you is another you. or maybe several you's.
15,01the inside you knows nothing of the external world, except for what the
15,01outside you tells it.
15,01this inside you is very ignorant. it just seems to be human nature to hide the
15,01truth from people, even the ones inside your head.

15,01lick and taste
15,01chomp and devour
15,01nothing is food for thought anymore, it's all been said before.
15,01stale bread... you don't eat stale bread. you throw it out and make new a new
15,01loaf of bread.
15,01of course you could go out and buy a loaf of bread at a store, but it wouldn't
15,01be yours. just some cheap, commercially infested loaf.
15,01make your own damn bread when the stuff in your fridge gets stale.
