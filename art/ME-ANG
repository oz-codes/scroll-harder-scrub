15,01ANGELS

15,01Believe
15,01In what you cannot see,
15,01Look through the fire,
15,01The ground is made of clouds,
15,01Holy divinity...
15,01Give my regards to the heavens-

15,01Angels,
15,01White light conquering over misery,
15,01She stands before my window,
15,01How I want to touch her face
15,01Before she fades away-

15,01They come to me in whispers,
15,01Like the first breath...
15,01They leave behind their voices,
15,01Crying to me in their song,
15,01And as I listen close...
15,01I can make out their words-

15,01Mary in chains,
15,01Industrial Jesus rising,
15,01Buildings with no one in them,
15,01A city of angels,
15,01No one comes...
15,01No one goes...
15,01I stand,
15,01I wait for them to come-

15,01Open your wings,
15,01Pretty child...
15,01Lets reveal the secrets of immortality,
15,01Sexual awakening in animal desire,
15,01I'll hold you by the throat,
15,01And fly with you on thoughts of velvet,
15,01No matter the torture,
15,01Or the copulation of two heavenly bodies,
15,01We will win out the night,
15,01And live for a day-

15,01In blasphemous thoughts
15,01We tumble through the rag weed,
15,01Angels will save what's left of us,
15,01And leave us waiting to pay for more,
15,01Selling my sanity to a golden man,
15,01Come, take my hand...
15,01Let's make believe a god-
