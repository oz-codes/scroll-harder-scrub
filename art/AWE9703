15,01        Yet another 00AWE Lettering 15pack out. It is our 006th 15one. That means we've
15,01been around for half a year now, which is pretty cool.

15,01        A few important  things happened this  month. Two of them  are 00Discyple
15,01getting into our 00senior staff 15and the group going 00invite only15. Keep reading for
15,01further explanations about both topics. But before  you get any  details, let's
15,01talk about the new artists.

15,01        We gained three new artists this month, who are in all three categories
15,01since we now have a new RIP Division.

15,01       > 00Agathocles  15 :  11I'm sure you have not heard of 10Agathocles 11yet, since I
15,01                         11found  him not  too long  after we released  the last,
15,01                         11pack on a local board. He's also in a group called 10Wot
15,01                         11which is formed of local artists to me (10514 ac11). Since
15,01                         11he is  the first  artist to  draw 10rips  11in 10AWE11, he has
15,01                         11automaticly been promoted to the 10RIP Coordinator11.

15,01       > 00Metal Militia15:  11I would really like to say  something about him, but I
15,01                         11just can't, since I have no idea who he is. What I can
15,01                         11say though is that he draws pretty good 10asciis. 11:)

15,01       > 00Mr4tune15      :  11For those  who have  not heard of  him yet, we got him
15,01                         11from 10CIA11. I am not sure, but I think he stayed with em
15,01                         11even though  he joined 10AWE11.  He is one of  the few new
15,01                         11fontists who will actually became very good.

15,01         We only lost one member this  month, due to 00inactivity15.  So we all say
15,01goodbye to 00Eerie15, and wish him luck with his new position in 00Fire15.
