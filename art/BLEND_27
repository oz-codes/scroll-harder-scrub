15,01   Three doctors got loaded in a bar and began bragging about their greatest
15,01triumphs.

15,01   The first surgeon, an Australian, said, "We once had a guy that had
15,01been squashed in a press in a printing works house last year. The only thing
15,01that was left was the left little finger. Our team of surgeons managed to
15,01construct a new hand, they built a new arm and a new body, so that when he 
15,01finally wentback to work, he became so efficient that he made five people
15,01unemployed. 

15,01     That's nothing, said a American surgeon.  We had a worker that got stuck
15,01in a nuclear reactor.  The only thing that was left was the hair.  We made a
15,01new head, a new body and new organs, and then we sent him back to the
15,01working life.  He got so efficient that he made fifty people unemployed.

15,01     The Canadian surgeon beat 'em both, saying, "One day, when I was out
15,01walking I smelled a fart.  I put the fart in a bag and carried it into the
15,01hospital, let it out on the table and started working.  First we wrapped
15,01the fart in an asshole, built a new ass and attached a body to it.
15,01Finally, it became a man named Jean Chretien, and he's making a whole
15,01fucking country unemployed."
