15,01        so where am i supposed to go now...you wizards of life
15,01        that have planned out the perfect path.

15,01        i look at my feet that are covered with mud and i laugh
15,01        heartily at your supposed knowledge.  the laugh is unsure
15,01        i don't know if i'm right yet...just that your universal
15,01        mold will hold me no more!

15,01        definitions are cast down on society.  "box 'em up! keep
15,01        'em in order.  BOXES!! ORDER!!"

15,01                ...wait, see that on the ground?...that little speck
15,01                   running free? that's me.


15,01   Q of blade's fine literature!
