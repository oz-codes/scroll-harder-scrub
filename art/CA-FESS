12,01As I speak th02ese words of true confession
12,01Shini02ng up in a trance of love.
12,01I cast a 02seed of your reflection
12,01Pouring down 02from skies above.

12,01The seas shall ra02ge with my hearts compassion
12,01Though02ts of you shall reign.
12,01And as 02im punished with all my transgressions
12,01My 02love is not in pain.

12,01Eyes of curios02ity have never sought my love
12,01And the t02ime has passed on.
12,01But mi02ne eyes have gazed to you my love
12,01The moment is not 02yet gone.

12,01If you can accept my 02mind free of question
12,01As 02I reach to the sky.
12,01I will han02d you my heart free of deception
12,01If not, 02my heart will d12i10e02.
