15,01(mrk) #ansi should be referred to as "namm" and we should all refer to how we
15,01      lost our youth in that hell.
15,01(mrk) "I lost an entire battalion in namm over an op war!"
15,01(mrk) "there were days when we didn't even have ops!  we had to live off
15,01      floods to survive!"
15,01(mrk) and instead of fighting Charlie, we were fighting Lamer
15,01(mrk) Lamer was all around!  He was flooding the channel and saying all sorts
15,01      of stupid shit.  But then a soldier stepped in, and collided his ass
15,01      off!  Never have there been such glory days.
15,01(mrk) "do you have any idea what it's like to see a close and personal friend
15,01      get bkicked in the face?  right in front of you?!  with you powerless to
15,01      do anything about it?!"
15,01(mrk) i say we never shoulda gone over to namm in the first place.  we shoulda
15,01      stayed home! near our loved ones.  in #teensex.
15,01<mrk> occasionally I'll have flashbacks to Namm, and I'll say wierd shit
15,01      like "Eye 4m 31337".
15,01<mrk> once in namm, we didn't get a shipment for over 30 days.  People were
15,01      going crazy, they were low on supplies and were ready to kill for a dcc.
15,01       Several people made fake shipments to try and appease the troops. 
15,01      Things were ugly.
15,01<mrk> At the beginning there was a lot of drug use in Namm.  People were
15,01      passing that shit around like no tomorrow.  But after a few years,
15,01      people got tired of it, and even though it's still used more than
15,01      anything, it's use is looked down upon.  I think it's because of the
15,01      media.
