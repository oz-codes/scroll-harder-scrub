15,01brown bottle spins in silence on cold lonely linoleum --
15,01you thought a few thousand swallows of pyrite
15,01could become an elixir of gold, but instead
15,01there was only the fountain of poison
15,01flowing into a gaping thirsty maw
15,01over which you had lost control
15,01dreams all die
15,01when you coat them with bitter amber
15,01brown glass prison
15,01    can't break free
