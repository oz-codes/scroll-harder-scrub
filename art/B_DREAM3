15,01  Drooling drooling I don't understand.
15,01The Doctor reaches into my chest, I feel the cold of his fingers as he 
15,01rips out my lung.  Pool of blood on the floor.  He scrape his fingers
15,01across my liver.  
15,01-Doc? Is this really necessary?
15,01-No.. Why?
15,01  Intestines shift, bowels move.  The light of infinite suns burns my eyes.
15,01Pain.. Pain..  The screams of a million children in a German furnace.
15,01The soft ejaculations of my life as it leaves my broken corpse.  Reach down,
15,01reach down into my stomach, into my kidney, bless my digestive tract
15,01and ooze into my rectum.
15,01I am dead now.
15,01All is black, dark, the lights of the infinite suns have all burned away
15,01like gas flares over the ridge.
15,01All is silent, the screams of a million children are all but cinders
15,01in my mind.
15,01The Doctor stands over my body.  Blood on his hands, his smock, his face,
15,01the floor, the walls, the audience.  He laughs and spins like a ballet 
15,01dancer on broken glass.  He turns to the audience.
15,01-This was a simple tonsillectomy, but I have taken it upon my self to
15,01 remove the rest of the vital organs as well, to demonstrate the 
15,01 _incorrect_ procedure, like when I was in the Congo.
15,01Zulus on the ridge, jar on the table.  Label reads, Tonsils..
15,01It is empty.

15,01  Another white room, another town, another hospital.
15,01I awaken to the sound of a piercing cry.
15,01Zulus on the ridge burned by gas flares.
15,01-I pressed the button but the nurse didn't come.
15,01The Doctor reaches for the syringe, I reach for his scalpel, cut my hand.
15,01Pool of blood on the floor.  Slice his chest open, the blade like a
15,01searing wave of heat through sour butter.  I see his ribcage, a prison
15,01for his innards.  I will break them out, they urge for freedom.  The chair
15,01breaks apart, egg shells in the wind.  His chest spilld onto the floor,
15,01wet sacks of gelatin sliding across an ice rink.  Slimy quivering pumping.
15,01The blood pours from the gaping cavity like a mountian waterfall in the
15,01Rockies.  I drag his body to the closet.  Blood on my hands, my smock, my 
15,01face, the floor, the walls, the audience.  The trail of burgandy life leads
15,01to the closet, the police will find the body.
15,01  I leave through the window and make my way through the fetid streets piled
15,01with blood soaked rags, old flesh junkies, and rotting bodies.
15,01Sirens wail!  They will catch me soon, I must escape.  Run down an alley.
15,01Trip and fall on top of a disembowled corpse.  The Face!  The smell over
15,01powers me.  The red and blue flashes of law and justice fade away.
15,01All is dark, all is black.
15,01I awaken in an amphitheatre strapped to a table.
15,01A Doctor stands over me with a scalpel.
15,01Drooling drooling I don't understand.
