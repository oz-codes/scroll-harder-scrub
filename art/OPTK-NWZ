15,01   Hi guys, here we  are  again  for  the latest news update
15,01from Italy's best art group.

15,01   As someone probably noticed, OPTiK members aren't calling
15,01outside Italy anymore.  That's  because  there's a difficult
15,01situation over here for phreakers.   There  seems to be some
15,01tracing going  on,  and  people  are  being  called  home by
15,01telco's people for verification.  We can't take any risks of
15,01this kind, so we'll start calling  out as soon as we're sure
15,01no one's gonna bust  us.   Sorry  for  the  people we called
15,01usually: we'll be back soon.

15,01   As for the pack  distribution,  we  must  give a very big
15,01thanks to RiSC members G-Man and  Yakumo for all the support
15,01they're giving us.   They're  spreading  our  pack all over.
15,01I'm sure they'll deliver it to all our sites as soon as they
15,01can.  Thanx a lot guys!

15,01   That's pretty much everything for now.  OPTiK members can
15,01be  found  on  IRC  sometimes,  on  channels  #drugs,  #ice,
15,01#phreak, #hack, #unix..  oh,  well,  just  look around.... I
15,01(Nuke) am looking for a  way  to  get to CCi without calling
15,01overseas, as  I  have  some  discussions  left  hanging over
15,01there.  Maybe you'll find me over there, too.

15,01   Later dudes!
