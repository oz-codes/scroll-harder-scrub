00,01Welcome, welcome, welcome ...

00,01This is, you guessed it, our first ANSiBasket ... Filled with half-hearted ANSi,
00,01great mistakes and an occasional masterpiece ...

00,01As this is our first pack, maybe we could do some explaining about how we 
00,01started, where it started and why ...

00,01Err ... Maybe we should explain quantumphysics ... It would be a lot easier,
00,01really !

00,01Ok, so here goes nothing ...

00,01Location : Keerbergen - Belgium

00,01Due to some misevent in the time-space continuum, Beyond met the wrong girl
00,01and followed her to Brussels ... The start of an adventure ...

00,01Location : Brussel - Belgium

00,01Beyond got hold of his first modem ... Starting fighting with his girlfriend
00,01over about everything, including phone-bills which had risen to the deadly
00,01amount of 1700,- BEF ... Arf arf arf ... :(
00,01Beyond got lost and found a job and went to ...

00,01Location : Verviers - Belgium

00,01Being bored to imaginary death, Beyond C00l (thence called Savage) was still
00,01affiliated with TUS, a long since deceased (and diseased) Syndicate which wanted
00,01to spread some ANSi around Belgium ... In this concept, Savage changed his name15 
00,01to ZozO le Zebre because it was 'lighter footed' than Savage and started a BBS.15 
00,01'The ZozO StudiO' never went anywhere except for some two loyal users and Zippy15 
00,01which had officially stopped calling anywhere ... The Studio was the very first 
00,01board in Belgium to be able to display LiVE ANSi ... Being far out, most people15 
00,01didn't understand the board and called once but never again ... (Maybe this was15 
00,01due to the fact that Beyond never got the file section right and therefore said15 
00,01that he didn't carry any files :) ... 
00,01Beyond, being fed up with his present job quit it and finally went back to ...

00,01Location : Keerbergen - Belgium

00,01Having changed places again, Beyond decided that Zoz0 le Zebre was too French to
00,01be carried in a Dutch and more English-minded environment and decided to change15 
00,01his name to 'MasterminD, Master of the Mind, Mind of the Master'. By then, the
00,01Zoz0 Studio had gone down and was never resurrected although plans existed for
00,01this for some three months ... Finally the project was abandoned, mainly due to 
00,01the lack of a phone line ...

00,01Mastermind turned into 'Prince Mao, Austerity is Wealth' due to some complete,
00,01utter psychological lapse of reason. Prince Mao started doing some small-scale
00,01trading which never got him any money only a lot of trouble and after three
00,01days, he abandoned ... Never to come back because by then an idea had come up...

00,01Mastermind was ressurected and starting roaming some boards around Belgium
00,01looking for a stable home base ... Finally, he found only one which was rather
00,01short-distance (He had been off the scene for a few months and *YoU* know how
00,01quickly things change around here ...) and which had a look and feel he could
00,01live with ... Meanwhile, he was still doing some ANSi-tryouts while trying to   
00,01put together some decent coding group which had to be called TRiNiTY ... It
00,01never really worked out and he abandoned the project, but never the name ...

00,01After a while, Mastermind Shape-Shifted the last time to become ... 'BeyonD
00,01C00l, I ain't C00l, I'm way beyond that ...'. BeyonD C00l started roaming around
00,01looking for people who were interested in ANSi and looking for one or two stable
00,01coders but was unable to find one as the only one who was to his likings was his
00,01local friendly neighbourhood sysop and he was with another group already ...
