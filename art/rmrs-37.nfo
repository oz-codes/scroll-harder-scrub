15,01REMORZE NPHO

15,01Welcome to the 37th Remorse 1981 Package of Quality Artwork for the ENTIRE
15,01Family(TM).  Hi.  My name is Arrogance and this is my NFO segment since
15,01stepping up from Lowly Doodle-Boy to Senior "Pimp" Staff.  In case you don't
15,01know me I would like to tell you a little about myself.  I am whiter than mHz
15,01and I am 21 years old.  I am a Saggitarious and I like walks on the beach, my
15,01girlfriend Kathryn, Chicken Strips from Denny's and ascii art.  Speaking of
15,01ascii art: I have been drawing this shit for longer than Wackie has had pubes.

15,01Enough about me; Let's talk about Remorse.  We fucking rule.  No if's, and's or
15,01but's about it.  We have survived the years, KTS, Atom Bomb, Bradly L. Sargon,
15,01Mimic, the various manifestations of Homosekzural ASCII and we'll survive the
15,01bullshit any of you decide to throw at us.  This isn't just my superior
15,01confidence, here.  This is cold, hard, mutha-fukkin' fact.  Word to your
15,01mother, your father, your favorite Jenny McCarthy jerk-off pictures, and
15,01whatever you canucks have instead of parents (I'm guessing Pods).  Not that
15,01I don't love canucks.  I DO!  Black "Jeffy-shnooks" Jack is one of my mostest
15,01favoritest people in the whole world.  I just know you people are from outer
15,01space.  Maybe the same planet Regis Philben is from.

15,01On a more serious note, I have something to say to some of you children that
15,01don't seem to understand what running a group consists of.  First, the facts.
15,01Both Spinsane and I are in the middle of a LOT of shit.  We have both moved
15,01within the last month.  Both of us work (I work 40 hours a week in fact).
15,01Neither of us are on IRC too often.  Does this make us incapable of running a
15,01group?  NO.  We have to be on IRC a lot?  What sense does that make?  4 hours
15,01a day talking about our cocks with a bunch of other guys does not make a
15,01better group president.  We have a mailing list.  Every member is on it (except
15,01Drax, but he's swedish so we can excuse that).  Plans are discussed.  Requests
15,01are made.  And everyone goes home happy and without being exposed to fag jokes
15,01or 3 hours of staring at "* m00ZlIPz is away : jaggin it (since 15:35-10/30)"
15,01repeat indefinately.  So why doesn't everyone just take a seat and enjoy the
15,01pack?  Thanks.  Especially big thanks go out to all the contributing artists.
15,01Without them we wouldn't have been able to do this.

15,01REMORSE NPHO PART DEUX - THE LEGEND CONTINUES

15,01well ack, nicely put. you were in this before i had pubes too. 
15,01you were in it since before you had pubes quite frankly, and 
15,01luckily the ascii scene's testosterone-ebbing effects 
15,01(analyzed by professor k. spiff in 1995) have kept you that way.

15,01unfortunately, i grew pubes first, and thus, i get peanut 
15,01butter stuck in them on occasion. but that doesn't stop me 
15,01from working full time at running remorse.

15,01speaking of remorse, what a talented, bad ass group of bitch 
15,01slappers. thanks to everyone who contributed and took it upon 
15,01themselves to draw themselves silly. you guys own, and i'm 
15,01frankly in love with all of you because of your endearing 
15,01tenacity.

15,01this month i'd like to thank t-bob for helping me with last 
15,01months release debacle. it was appreciated. also, check out 
15,01triplogic's flagship remorse!lit piece, formed for the sole 
15,01purpose of battling cia's release of 1meg lit packs with vga 
15,01loaders.

15,01well, that was my interpretation. actually, the lit is by 
15,01ricky martin i think. or someone :)
