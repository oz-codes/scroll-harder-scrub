15,01BlueJay - Frost Byte <CiA>

15,01The bluejays song is hidden with meaning today,
15,01as if it has a reason to sing it's song.
15,01The notes playing in a changing array,
15,01nature seems to be playing along.

15,01The trees swing with rythmic might,
15,01and great power and ability.
15,01The clouds float at tremendous height,
15,01with treasured speed and agility.

15,01The sun blares with emmence light,
15,01illuminating all the day.
15,01All the darkness has gone without a fight,
15,01and the horizon has little to say.

15,01I seem more in tune today,
15,01it is not a day to be ignored.
15,01The calendar states it's Sunday,
15,01the birds song is for the Lord.
