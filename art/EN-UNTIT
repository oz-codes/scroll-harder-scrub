15,01Happy depresion.
15,01Painful ecstasy.
15,01Short lived freedom.
15,01Escaping. If only for a while.
15,01Leaving behind all my problems.
15,01Reality is lost in a haze.
15,01I love it. But I know it
15,01will destroy me.
15,01It's like dreaming.
15,01Letting routine take over
15,01to actually thinking.
15,01I am a shell. A mask over
15,01an empty void, but I am scared.
15,01Scared that when I awaken,
15,01nothing will be like before.
15,01When I come to my senses,
15,01my life will no longer belong
15,01to me. That I will have lost
15,01control. That my appetite will
15,01cause me to become consumed.
