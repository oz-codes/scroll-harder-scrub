15,01A Haiku

15,01grubby kids downstairs
15,01they eat and sleep way too much
15,01i'll turn off the heat!

15,01Another Haiku

15,01Faster, slaves, faster!
15,01Our net profit is sinking.
15,01I finger my whip.

15,01A last Haiku

15,01Seppuku is wrong
15,01but what if I take the lives
15,01of the slaves with me?
