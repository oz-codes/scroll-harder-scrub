15,01                    12...After reading Frankenstein


15,01               12But you   now   you
15,01               12with your Prometheus genre
15,01               12& its idiot spark with the big heart
15,01               12you drew back the veil of God
15,01               12exposing yourself to the very face
15,01               12easing your premature play
15,01               12of line & sag
15,01               12so that to our harsh perceptions
15,01               12you seemed made new
15,01               12while claiming only metamorphosis

15,01               12Through days confused with lilies
15,01               12& frustration for lack of the murder
15,01               12he wandered a lesser Oedipus
15,01               12neither king nor prince
15,01               12& told me of his loneliness

15,01               12Marking the crude tracks
15,01               12wrapped round his wrists
15,01               12& the dull yellow of his eyes
15,01               12like the pages of aged books
15,01               12his loneliness infected me
15,01               12so that I understood him at last

15,01               12The need of a bride
15,01               12I admitted to be inescapable
15,01               12as I turned away from the fire
15,01               12into the dark made bitter by leaving
15,01               12& gazing at the hunch of back
15,01               12haloed though underlit
15,01               12I knew   Mary   it would have been you
