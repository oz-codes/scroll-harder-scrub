11,01A Shin14ing 00in the Darkness


11,01The wa14rmt00h I felt that gentle night
11,01The em14bra00ce of your silky soft arms
11,01The lo14ve 00we had between us there
11,01That l14ove 00you used to harm

11,01I had 14a d00ream that come some day
11,01My lov14e w00ould stand beside me
11,01That d14rea00m I had you took away
11,01Now al14l I 00dream of is nothing

11,01The da14rk 00cold room I've made for me
11,01Furnis14hed 00by memories that we once had
11,01The wi14dow 00of death I see you now
11,01This m14ess00age to you, I'm not sad

11,01The da14rkn00ess my shelter, my only home
11,01I welc14ome 00you to it some day
11,01I live 14in 00this painful house all alone
11,01But so14on 00it be yours, that I pray

11,01There 14is 00a shining in this darkness
11,01Only I 14ca00n see it to be true
11,01Most p14eop00le die when they are kissed by death
11,01I'll be 14t00he one to kiss you
