15,01- senseless -



15,01Colors fade before hollow eyes.
15,01Empty ears are mesmerized.
15,01Lifeless nerves cry out in pain.
15,01Judgement call seems inhumane.

15,01Fragrance dies to muted smell.
15,01Senses all are dead in hell.
15,01Voiceless, you try to scream.
15,01All you hold are broken dreams.



15,01- Scimitar Wraith - DARK - (c) 1994 -

15,01may this intonement mark the tombstones of 
15,01the hearts of all who have fallen to the 
15,01cruel persuasions of a heartless society.  
15,01damn the system. resurrect the truth. . .
