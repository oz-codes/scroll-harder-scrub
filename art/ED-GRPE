15,01She knew from the start that she and him were meant to be
15,01She wouldn't let anyone tell her she wasn't free
15,01To see and love him as they ought to be

15,01A scar upon her forehead
15,01Reminds her of the morbid
15,01Nights of her youth in that town
15,01With her tailgating following that clown

15,01Her parents didn't want her to go
15,01But she knew she had to go to his show
15,01They forbad her, and forsaked her
15,01But she brushed it off and they didn't stop her

15,01She knew from the start that she and him were meant to be
15,01She wouldn't let anyone tell her she wasn't free
15,01To see and love his as they ought to be

15,01He stood on stage ready to show them
15,01What he had done with his talent God gave him
15,01The crowd stood waiting as he hit the stage
15,01Uniformed men stand to hold back the rage

15,01She rushed up to love him
15,01But the uniformed one had to block him
15,01As she kissed him
15,01The crowd watched with a glim

15,01She knew from the start that she and him were meant to be
15,01She wouldn't let anyone tell her she wasn't free
15,01To see and love him just as they ought to be

15,01He whiped around to see this distraction
15,01But the police had pulled her into retraction
15,01She knew he would never know her
15,01So her kept playing `Only for her'

15,01She fell to the ground and earned a large gash
15,01She was flipped into the cell and lost all her cash
15,01They kept her there while he went on with the show
15,01But she couldn't stop, she needed to know...
