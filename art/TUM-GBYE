00,01remixed mrk ascii. these are dredged up from long ago. felt kind of bad that
00,01he never received credit for being a good font artist just because he had rough
00,01shaping. this was revolutionary for that era. compared to the festering status
00,01of fonts today. COME ON people. reinventing yourselves isn't that hard. madonna
00,01did it, janet jackson did it, even sam donaldson did it.15 00let's all follow the
00,01examples set by these big breasted superstars.15 00kind of ironic that i say this
00,01at the bottom of a remixed ascii. oh well.
