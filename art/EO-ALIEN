15,01                                ALIEN  FOR  SALE
15,01           
15,01        "I'll give you five hundred dollars for her," offered Josh Pintac,
15,01gesturing to the silver-barred cage. Inside, a cat-like woman prowled the
15,01perimeter. Her hair was dark and long, and her eyes were vibrant and bright
15,01green, almost neon. Her ears were pointed, and she had a delicate black tail.
15,01She was not tall, maybe five feet three inches at most, and she glared at the
15,01two men as they talked about, but never to, her. A long, sturdy chain attached
15,01her wrist to the bars, as if the cage wasn't quite enough.

15,01        "Nah, she's worth a good deal more. You government agents aren't
15,01gettin' your hands on her unless I get properly paid," refused Matt Delsa.
15,01"After all, her ship landed on my farm."
15,01"Understand, Mr. Delsa, that we will not take no for an answer," warned Pintac,
15,01tossing a subtle glance at his coat pocket, where a gun bulged.

15,01        "And I won't be selling an alien for any less than five million.
15,01Farmers need to get along, you know!" replied Delsa, not thrown by the other
15,01man's threats. "I have her spaceship, don't forget. The engineering is
15,01incredible!" He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Of course, if I'm not alive,
15,01you might never find it...... But of course your superiors will understand."

15,01        Pintac was trapped. "Fine," he relented. "You'll get your money. But
15,01how do I know this isn't some girl you've dressed up?"

15,01        "Would I risk the wrath of the FBI?" reasoned the farmer. "I call her
15,01Andora. I like the sound of it."

15,01        "Sweena," hissed the woman in the cage.

15,01        "She speaks English?" asked Josh in disbelief.

15,01        "Nah, she just keeps repeating that. I'm sure it's probably a curse on
15,01us," laughed the farmer, and Josh joined in.

15,01        "Well, I'd better be going," said Josh when the round of polite
15,01laughter was over. He surveyed the gray skies. "Looks like a storm. I'll be
15,01back tomorrow with a few others to examine the alien and her spacecraft. And of
15,01course, I'll bring the money. Two million, and not a penny more."

15,01        "Well, it's more than I'd make in a lifetime of farming, so I'll take
15,01it," decided Delsa. He also looked at the sky, at the clouds rumbling in. "But
15,01the storm will be here before you get out of town, and it'll be a big one. The
15,01roads will all turn to mud. You'd best stay the night." Josh Pintac had no
15,01choice but to agree.
15,01              
15,01        The night was spent at a small house on the farm. Andora was given a
15,01dinner, which she did not eat, and Josh and Matt found themselves on the patio
15,01talking long into the night. The winds howled, and it was cold, but Matt
15,01brought out a couple of heavy coats and they were fine. Andora hissed "Sweena"
15,01a few more times, but they laughed, and soon ignored her. They went inside when
15,01the rain came, and left her in the cold.

15,01        Pintac woke up in the middle of the night, as did Delsa. Both heard the
15,01eerie howls and moans, just outside the window. It had to be Andora. They tried
15,01their best to ignore her and go back to sleep.
15,01            
15,01        At dawn the next morning, the two men went outside to examine their
15,01treasure. She was still there, and she looked up at the sound of the intruding
15,01men. The cage was a shambles, lying in eight twisted pieces. The chain was
15,01still around her wrist, and attached to what was left of the cage. She glared
15,01up at the men accusingly. If they had slept in, she would have been long gone.  
15,01           

15,01        "Wow." That was all Delsa could say. "Wow."

15,01        "Can you get the end of the chain?" asked Pintac.             

15,01        "You're the agent, you do it!" said the farmer. Josh dove for the
15,01chain, and Andora spun around. He grabbed the end and shielded himself behind
15,01the piece of metal that held the chain. He carefully unwound it, keeping his
15,01eye on the enraged alien.

15,01        "Alright," he said, handing the chain to Matt. "Let's find her ship."

15,01        Matt Delsa hadn't known the exact location of the small spaceship, but
15,01with Andora leading him, he found it in no time. Josh Pintac looked over the
15,01white bullet-shaped ship in appreciation. "How do you open it?"

15,01        Andora seemed to understand. She pressed a palm against the side of a
