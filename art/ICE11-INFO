15,01                        The iCEPACK - November Issue


15,01        Well, here it is!  The fourth in an ongoing series of monthly art
15,01packages by iCE has finally come into existence: iCEPK-11.  The art scene has
15,01never before seen such a compilation of talent, hard work, and sweat such as
15,01this one, and I think it'll be a while before the likes of this is seen again.
15,01Many people worked long hours to get this thing together, and some of us even
15,01put off doing very important research papers to put in time on this (grr). Some
15,01last minute thanks go to: Marshal Law, Eternal Darkness, and Riothamus for
15,01their last minute revisions of thier respective works.  Many of the VGA's in
15,01the iCEPACK were drawn by the artist as long as three months ago, but have been
15,01sitting on what has fondly become known as 'the pile' on Rivendell (iCE WORLD
15,01Headquarters..subtle hint); this should explain why a few of the items in here
15,01are dated December 1st.
15,01        First I want to explain why I have only one ansi out this month instead
15,01of the like...shyt..ten+ that I normally have.  I'm not going to apologize
15,01because it's not because of me that I haven't put out more than 1, it's because
15,01of October.  During the month of October, we had very high quality releases,
15,01but very low quantity, and if every artist were releasing equally, then there
15,01wouldn't be a problem, but they werent.  A few artists were carrying the weight
15,01for the rest, and among those were The Necromancer, and Repete Ophender whom
15,01I'd like to thank.  And I've had to spend most of this month correcting that
15,01situation, calling people, writing tons of email and posts, and I found to my
15,01dismay that I didn't have any time to do the ansi's that I like doing so much
15,01(and it's true, I love doing them..trying new things..etc).  So that explains
15,01my lack of ANSi production this month.  To end on a happier note however, I've
15,01found a new field of interest...........
15,01                               V      G      A
15,01   ......yes folks, TEMPUS FINALLY HAS A 286 AND A VGA MONITOR!!!  The world
15,01has Nasty Child (Ex-iCE Staff Member) to thank for this most fortunate turn of
15,01events.  All I have to say is, VGA rules.
15,01        Well, I guess the big news this month is Marshal Law's latest ansi, and
15,01what alot of you may be asking, "Who's that Amroth guy?".  First ML's ANSi; not
15,01bad for about 2 days work, huh?  (And I thought I worked fast!)  And he's told
15,01us that he's going to be producing ansi's more frequently in the near future,
15,01so we're all looking forward to seeing what comes from his corner.  Next,
15,01Amroth.  Amroth comes from a group called Death run by Morbid Angel who became
15,01a Vice President at iCE when he merged with us.  Amroth was the star player in
15,01Death, a group consisting of some highly productive, high potential, but raw
15,01talent, and he seems to be refining very nicely.  In his first month at iCE,
15,01he's already produced the largest ANSimation ever, and promises to do much
15,01more, we're really proud of this guy.  Two other new guys this month are last
15,01minute additions, Smooth from Hawaii, and AADA from CyberCrime (well, at least
15,01that's where *I* know him from..heh), we got something last minute from AADA
15,01this month, and hopefully we'll be able to show you some work by Smooth in
15,01December.
15,01         Promotions this month include:  Napalm, who is now an iCE Artist,
15,01and Wolverine who is somewhere in limbo.  Oh, almost forgot, The Magical
15,01Gangster from Texas joined us this month, and had 3 VGA's in the iCEPACK..nice
15,01work.
15,01         New features in the iCEPACK include the iCEAPP.EXE, the second version
15,01of the original iCE Application Generator done by Black Spyrit and LoP.  This
15,01time the generator was programmed by Force Ten, and showcases some of the top
15,01art of the group recently and in past months.  The generator still has that
15,01'GRiM' feel to it, but FT's promised to make revisions on it each month.   The
15,01other new feature would be...umm..this file!  Yeah, that's it.   Sorry I
15,01couldn't get the interview thing going, LM..there just wasn't time, and it
15,01wouldn't have really worked out, but your files will not go to waste, just
15,01wait.
15,01         Note to all, Manslayer, Black Wolf, and Mr. Mister have all been
15,01inactive due to hardware failure.  Black Wolf just got a borrowed monitor
15,01(coutesy of me!) and has already re-started on a number of his old projects,
15,01and Mr. Mister is starting from scratch with a new system from MS.  Look
15,01forward to some nice ANSi work from Black Wolf next month, and some nice VGA
15,01work from the team of Black Wolf and Mr. Mister.  My apologies to any new
15,01members I forgot to mention, or Sites/Member Boards/couriers I forgot to list.
15,01         Special note to those who use NDOS:  Use Norton Commander to view the
15,01contents of the iCEPACK, it'll make your life much easier, and the weird dashes
15,01will make sense.  Extra special note to those who use Norton Commander:  When
15,01viewing the directory containing the iCEPACK, make the directory listing
15,01*UNSORTED*, it'll make your life even easier still.
