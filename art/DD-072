15,01        A lot of time and effort has gone into the writing of DarkDraw
15,01        by Techie [Havok] and therefore to have a useful copy you are
15,01        going to have to register it.  

15,01        Just hit ALT Z for the help screen once you are in the program
15,01        it has all the commands in it (and hey putting that there doubled
15,01        the length of this thing so appreciate it :)

15,01        The sole feature that you lack in an unregistered copy is the
15,01        ability to change the output length.  If you can live with 
15,01        none of your ansi's ever working over the modem then use it
15,01        as long as you want without registering.  Also if you register
15,01        you will get ALL the new updates not just a limited number like
15,01        some software.  Also all suggestions by registered users will
15,01        be taken into consideration.
15,01        
15,01                Please note that if you are caught distributing the
15,01                registered version, you will not receive new versions
15,01                and will lose all other privileges of being a 
15,01                registered user.
15,01      
15,01        If you wish to register now, the price is $20; it will go up
15,01        to $25 before it's done.
