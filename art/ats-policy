[ Introduction ]

Hello. 

This policy is designed to try to advocate a new a completly different
policy for the underground community that is designed for "anti disclosure"
basicly the opposite of full disclosure but with a few side notes that advocate
some disclosure of bug information but in general this is designed to be a 
policy that people will read and think, "Hey.. this is the right thing!",
hopefully.


[ What is this policy ]

This policy is basicly a guideline.

It will demonstrate that it is not good to post bug/exploit information to
places like BUGTRAQ, packetstorm, other public forums. It will show that
most of the people that are excessively posting bugs to these public forums 
are  actually not doing it for security but quite the contrary for things
like fame, jobs, etc.

The policy will show you that if you are really interested in security
that there is a much better way of increasing security, because basicly
when you send a new bug and an exploit to a place like BUGTRAQ you are
actually decreasing security and potentially causing hundreds of thousands
of people high damage from when script kiddies use your bug/exploit to
break into their system.


It will demonstrate the best way to maintain the anti security policy 
which is to keep bugs/exploits private within either a very small group
of trusted people that have the skill to understand what it is about or just
simply keep it for yourself. If however the exploit leaks you should contact 
vendor and tell him about the bug. If the bug is discovered by someone else
or the vendor has fixed the problem you are free to post the exploit to a
non public forum, maybe your website.

Also it is essential to demonstrate that a person that is looking for security 
bugs does so just for the sheer enjoyment and thrill, difficulty of finding 
and obvious bug or a very difficult to find bug and then possible exploiting
it, after this has taken place he should carry  on and start looking for other
bugs, ie: by auditing src code, doing protocol 'checks', reverse engineering
and using security logic. This is an important thing in this policy that needs
to be addressed. We do this because we love it!

 
[ Purpose of the policy ]


The purpose of this policy is to raise public awareness of a new way 
of thinking in the security scene, it is written to try to help out 
the anti security movement and to show interested people the best
way to be a part of the anti security movement, by using this policy.

One of the main reasons for this policy and what it is meant to address is the
need for none-disclosure, which is basicly because way too much stuff  is
getting sent to BUGTRAQ and people like us really dont like it that way
and we hope that you wont like it either after studying anti security. 

The purpose of this policy is to give people that are hackers a policy
that they can use to keep things private as they should remain and not
tempted by the dark side.

[ Is this a joke? ]

For some reason a lot of people think this is a joke, I've been asked about 4 
times wether this whole anti security thing is a joke. And to answer your
question about this policy, No! It is not a joke we take this seriously but
we welcome any flames, comments or whatever that anyone might have.



[ The policy ]



The policy in a nutshell.

1. Do not tell the world about security bugs you find.
2. Do not release exploits to public forums.
3. If you are serious about security, notify only vendor.
4. If exploit leaks, notify vendor.
5. If bug becomes public, you are safe to release exploit to 
   a none public forum.
6. Never ever give bug or exploit information out on a bug/exploit
   trusted to you by the discoverer/author of the bug/exploit. This
   is basis for trust, do not give what you did not write!

This will demonstrate basicly the steps and scenarios that might 
happen and how the policy is used in those steps, thus describing the
policy.

note: fiction ;>

Okay let's create a few variables.

HACKER = The person that wants to use the anti security policy
VENDOR = Company or group that wrote the program that HACKER found bug in
COMMUNITY = BUGTRAQ, PACKETSTORM, and the like.

Background:

HACKER is an avid auditer and finds a bug in bind-8.2.2-P7 a 1 byte overflow
which is pretty difficult to exploit but he manages, he writes an exploit
for this bug and he gives it to a very small amount of people, possible
people that are maybe in his group or that he trusts explicitly.

< scenario 1 >

HACKER who is a follower of the anti security policy does not notify the
community or the vendor and the bug lives on for many years, hopefully ;>
Causing little or no damage at all.

< scenario 2 >

HACKER is a TRUE security minded person, ie: someone that really cares
about security and is not the typical "hey I say I care about security
but what I really want is fame and a job". Allright this person who 
also has hopefully read something about the anti security movement and
since he really apreciates security he should ONLY contact the vendor and 
let them handle it.

< scenario 3 >

HACKER is a glory/fame seeker and he decides to post the bug to the
COMMUNITY. Ofcorse he says it is in the interest of full disclosure 
and not fame and the like. He has read some full disclosure 
policy and notifies vendor maybe 5 days before he releases the bug and
most likely the exploit too. 

After the five days have passed, we must conclude that the vendor has issued
some sort of hotfix or a patch to fix the security problem and now the HACKER
sends the bug information, the exploit to the COMMUNITY and possible a
patch too. 

Now has security been increased? Do you really think that most of COMMUNITY. 
ie: the people that read BUGTRAQ want to patch their servers? No! It is 
script kiddies that are waiting for the latest warez, as soon as HACKER
releases this new bug to the COMMUNITY thousands of script kiddies with
little or no skill will start breaking into hundreds of thousands
of boxes and if this bug were genuine, they would! And belive me lots of 
boxes would get destroyed.

Now, I ask.. is this a good thing you are doing by posting to the COMMUNITY
all logic says NO!

< scenario 4 >

HACKER in this scenarion followed the anti security movement.

HACKER has had the  exploit for a year or more and now for some strange
reason you hear rumors that script kiddies have the exploit. If these rumors
turn out to be correct you have an obligation to notify the vendor, so that
they can issue a patch, because this can cause just as much havoc as when 
people post to the COMMUNITY

Q: Well what is the damn difference then?!? It is bound to leak someday. 
A: Yes it happens much to often but there is alot of stuff out there
   that has not leaked and the best way to not make things leak is too 
   not give to anyone at all. This however is not possible for some so   
   the best thing is to limit it to ONLY people that you trust 100 %.
   And we hope that people that follow the anti security trend will
   also realize a crucial point which is not to give what u didn't write!




Someone else has found the bug that HACKER found and has notified the
COMMUNITY and VENDOR. After this has happened HACKER is free to publish
his code on a non-public forum, like his personal website. This however is not
required at all.


[ Using the policy ]

Follow the guidelines that were outlined in previous sections, and remember
what keynotes.

[ Contribute to the policy ]

This policy is considered pre-beta and is subject to heavy change. We need
alot of help in adjusting this policy and so if you have any ideas about
things that are not clear and how to clear them up then please send us
that information. Also if you have things you would like to add/tweak
just send it.


[ Thanks and reference ]

This policy is written by anonymous and it will remain that way because
it is not supposed to portrait the views on a single person but of all
the people that follow this movement.

However certain groups and people deserve credit:

silent for starting anti security and doing most of the work.
jimjones for writing the great intro and FAQ!
RFP for writing a policy for the full disclosure people.
Everyone that has contributed so far!
