15,01Upon the lips of the almost dead:

15,01"I have confronted the greatest power
15,01I have fought with all my might
15,01Down to the dreariest hour
15,01When the darkness overcame the light
15,01I faced the mighty BladeStorm
15,01They killed us all in a single blow
15,01We bowed to the oncoming swarm
15,01We sought refuge down below
15,01I beseech you to beware
15,01Though you may feel sheltered and warm
15,01You know not what lies beyond here
15,01You know not the power of BladeStorm!"

15,01 And another man died at the hands of BladeStorm....
