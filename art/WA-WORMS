15,01stepping away from the house (now a mausoleum)
15,01ecstatic from the acts committed

15,01a man, farmer man
15,01he lies propped against the wall
15,01shotgun in hand
15,01eyes open (perhaps he's afraid to shut them)
15,01he knows what will be coming soon

15,01a woman, house woman
15,01she sits with her legs sprawled out in the hall
15,01knitwork in hand
15,01eyes open (she has no reason to shut them)
15,01her man's silly games mean nothing

15,01a child, lonely child
15,01hides under the sheets, under the covers
15,01cradling kitten
15,01eyes closed (for the child no longer moves)
15,01it's life flame has already been extinguished

15,01'old man, husband
15,01you're guarding the wrong entrance
15,01you should not have left the window open'

15,01there: woman, house woman
15,01still sits with her legs sprawled
15,01knitwork since dropped
15,01eyes open (she's now unable to shut them)
15,01a gash in her throat to match her child's second mouth

15,01there: man, farmer man
15,01has now fallen to the floor
15,01shotgun at side
15,01eyes closed (but he's unaware)
15,01choked in a pool of his own drunken vomit

15,01mud sloshes on a warm rainy January night
15,01feet trample the soil the generations have tilled (but no longer)
15,01stepping away from the house (now a mausoleum)
