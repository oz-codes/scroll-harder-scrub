15,01Sigh, this is something that I like to write about because it's one
15,01of the truest emotions in the universe (and makes better poems than
15,01hate)  Anyways, I know this may not be what guys are supposed to
15,01write about BUT my girlfriend sure liked it. ;)

15,01                                Love

15,01Adam without Eve.
15,01Joseph without Mary.
15,01Where would we be?

15,01Romeo and Juliet.
15,01Marc Antony and Cleopatra.
15,01How else could it be.

15,01Simba and no Nala.
15,01Me and no you.
15,01Hard to imagine what life would hold.

15,01Love comes at first sight.
15,01Love will take time but
15,01Don't worry, it will find you.

15,01Love is two people.
15,01Sharing their lives.
15,01Love is an eternal.

15,01Love has no boundaries.
15,01True love is only found once in a lifetime.
15,01Just remember, love is what you make it to be.
