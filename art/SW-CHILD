15,01- Children -


15,01One more garden; one more lie -
15,01One more bite, and then we die.
15,01Dust to man, to dust depart;
15,01Withered blood within our hearts.

15,01One brother lying on the ground;
15,01Walk the death that you have found;
15,01Marked by death and marked by strife,
15,01You regret you took his life.

15,01Now the days turn to the flood -
15,01Millions drowned beneath their blood;
15,01No more creed in this decree,
15,01Only marred hypocrisy.

15,01One bush burning in the sands;
15,01Staff to snake within his hands -
15,01One million people of the flame;
15,01Forty years to take their names.

15,01One man born to pay the price;
15,01Fallen as a sacrifice;
15,01Crucified by pagan lies -
15,01Temple broken as he died.

15,01One to rise and raise the call;
15,01Same was born to save us all.
15,01Claimed his faith and was denied,
15,01Even as he touched the skies.

15,01One word of life; one blame of death;
15,01Revolution in your breast.
15,01Inquisition blade pierces your heart
15,01With your thoughts banned from the start.

15,01Six million dead beyond the sun -
15,01Die together; die as one.
15,01Burned by chaos and by hate
15,01As we struggle to relate.

15,01Now in fire and in night,
15,01Our troubled hate is burning bright -
15,01The spawn of animosity
15,01Inside the souls of you and me.

15,01Prophets of the Dark Daystar -
15,01One by one, our hearts are scarred.
15,01Spirit of time slips through our hands;
15,01We are the children of the damned.
