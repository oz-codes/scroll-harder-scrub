15,01Dimension X

15,01A distant place beyond the stars is where your journey leads
15,01A place where no attent is payed for all those evil deeds
15,01You cannot escape the pain ; your life force it will drain
15,01A place of bitter sorrow, is where you shall remain
15,01A haven for the lost, a haven for the dread
15,01A haven where your soul shall find its place amongst the dead
15,01It looms out in the distance: like a forboding hex
15,01You realize in an instance, you've arrived in Dimension X
