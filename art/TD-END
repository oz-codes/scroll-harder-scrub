15,01             Suddenly amid the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth
15,01           the wild scream of a terrified woman.  That shrilling scream
15,01           woke me up and I turned off the tv.  I went to the bathroom
15,01           brushed my teeth and went to bed with all my clothes.  The
15,01           slight glow of my alarm clock allowed me to see a reflection
15,01           in the mirror.  I looked at the reflection from the bottom
15,01           up.  On the feet of this person were black boots with flannel
15,01           socks, grey tweed pants, a flannel shirt, and a frayed yellow
15,01           mock turtle neck.  I then moved to the face I saw a pale
15,01           complexion with green eyes and a crew cut.  I looked deeper
15,01           into the eyes and finally was able to penetrate the thin film
15,01           that protects his windows to the world.  Inside I saw black.
15,01           As I made my way through the black I became weighed down by
15,01           the colored matter which clung to my bare feet.  I began to
15,01           sink in the sludge.  When my head was completely submerged I
15,01           opened my mouth and tasted the matter, I felt as if I was
15,01           sucking on heaven.  The buds on my tongue began to engulf my
15,01           body.  I was now in my moth tasting the black.  I was moving
15,01           from bud to bud absorbing each different aspect of the taste.
15,01           Instead of getting the combination of all the tastes I was
15,01           getting each individual flavor of the matter.  I moved to the
15,01           back of my tongue and wanted to ride the sludge into my
15,01           stomach as we began to slither down I moved up into my nose
15,01           and brain.  Inside my brain there were many tunnels, I could
15,01           not chose where to go.  I saw this one opening approached it
15,01           and climbed out of my ear.  I floated towards the ceiling and
15,01           was separated from my body.
15,01                Good Morning this is 92.3 WXRK now back to the Howard
15,01           Stern Show, my alarm continued to blare and my mother came in
15,01           to wake me up.  In the entity where I was floating I could
15,01           see my non-responding body lay motionless and cold while my
15,01           mother screamed wildly.  I saw the ambulance come and put my
15,01           shell in a black vinyl bag.  It was seconds later when the
15,01           environment changed and I was seeing my coffin put six under,
15,01           then I approached the light and was back to where it all
15,01           00began15.
