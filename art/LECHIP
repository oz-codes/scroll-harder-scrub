15,01Yesterday at taco bell,
15,01I ordered a some chips, they sure we're swell.
15,01I ate them quick, I ate them fast.
15,01Before too long, I was at the last.
15,01Not wanting to finish them all so soon,
15,01I stuck it in my pocket.

15,01Three days later, in my mind
15,01I thought of food, of orange rind.
15,01My brain wandered to the chip
15,01I said "oh my god, oh shit!"
15,01I looked inside my jeans,
15,01and all I found were some magic beans.
15,01I searched my room, far and wide
15,01And then I said "oh shit" again.

15,01To the dishwasher I ran
15,01(I wash my clothes in there, man!)
15,01I tore it apart to find the chip,
15,01I nearly lost my best dick clip.
15,01But just as I was turning round,
15,01The washer made a funny sound.
15,01"I will eat you!" the washer said,
15,01and before too long I died.
