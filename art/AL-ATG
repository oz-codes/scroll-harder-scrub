15,01      An Answer to Grief

15,01You say that you're defeated
15,01You say your time has died
15,01Without the love you needed
15,01You've despaired and wept and lied

15,01You need to learn to love yourself
15,01You have to learn to love yourself

15,01You haven't been mistreated
15,01You haven't been denied
15,01It's just that you've retreated
15,01From the savior life provides

15,01You haven't learned to love yourself
15,01You need to learn to love yourself

15,01Pain's claim has not succeded
15,01No matter how you've cried
15,01If the circle stays completed
15,01If you know the truth... inside

15,01If you learn to love yourself
15,01Once you learn to love yourself...
