15,01"Sometimes, I wonder where I'm going.  I mean, my profession isn't exactly 
15,01original, and there isn't much room for advancement.  I guess I should consider
15,01myself lucky, being able to breathe underwater and all, but I'm not happy. 
15,01What did all those octupi do to us anyways? They keep out of our business, so
15,01why don't we keep out of theirs? So they have cults. Big deal! Who doesn't try
15,01and take over the world at least once in their lives?  
15,01I don't understand it, the fighting and all.  It isn't fair.  I wish for a 
15,01perfect world where rats and octupi can live in peace, but I know that will 
15,01never happen.  
15,01Anyways, if we lived in peace, what would I be doing now? Spying on humans?
15,01I think not."
