00,01Treason of a Different Kind

00,01young boy looking so alone, no food in his empty home
00,01nothing to do for one of his kind, his soul he must find
00,01streets outside show the lands despair, it ain't fair
00,01his life should be left aside, he shouldn't have to hide

00,01old woman sits at the side of her home, as she pats her womb
00,01tears rolling from her eye, she knows she can't help but cry
00,01her friends who were once so close, now look for the ending overdose
00,01her head jerks back so sharply, her smile says thanks for thier mercy

00,01young man pushed into his line of work, people say its the devils work
00,01no choice offered to him, he's binded by threats which will never dim
00,01so on he works punishing those he doesn't know, what a deadly blow
00,01inhumane he piles them high, then another comes and must die

00,01foreign helpers stand still and choke, woman gets killed not a joke
00,01they're powerless to stop it even when its close, they're like a ghost
00,01they're there to protect their own, to make sure they get home
00,01but what of the boy, the woman, and the man, who fry in the pan

00,01dimming light crying for help, as her children cry and whelp
00,01looking away we can't stand the sight, kill that fuckin light
00,01so we hear something else, what our giants choose
00,01listen for maybe a few days, but hey look a mouse made it through a maze
