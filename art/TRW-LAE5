15,01        After the San Caradine Crisis, a mutant breed of electrons were
15,01discovered floating around in the atmosphere. These were usually two or
15,01three times larger than the ordinary kind that chemists were used to and
15,01were highly excitable, capable of delivering a charge in direct relation to
15,01their size, a range between 3.20598 x 10^-19 to 4.80897 x 10^-19 Coulombs.
15,01These were called ETHER (Electronically Transmitted, High-Efficiency
15,01Radiation) and gave special people special abilities.
15,01        Those who stood out from the rest of the population couldn't be spotted
15,01by looks alone. The variant was in their blood.
15,01        Haemoglobin in normal human blood contains a porphyrin ring at its
15,01centre. At the core of the porphyrin ring is an iron atom that gives blood
15,01its scarlet red colour. When the iron atom is replaced by one of another
15,01element, the entire porphyrin ring gets changed around and the blood takes
15,01on a different colour and the person through whose veins the blood flowed
15,01found themselves capable of playing with the ETHER in strange and fantastic
15,01ways.
15,01        Forbidden Image was an ETHER Manipulative; 15% of his blood was a dark
15,01shade of jade green and contained an aluminum core which allowed him to
15,01weakly attract the electrons of gaseous, diatomic elements within a seven
15,01metre radius with his head as the centre. The valence (outermost) electrons
15,01of the gas get plucked like guitar strings so that they leave their original
15,01orbital around the nucleus, jump to a higher orbital and then jump back. In
15,01jumping back, energy is released in the form of coloured light with which he
15,01occasionally painted images in the air around him and at times, most notably
15,01when he was drunk, his creations could get exceptionally crude and nasty.
15,01Though he was a party favourite (his pornos were short but NEVER
15,01scrambled!), his abilities didn't come without work nor did they present
15,01themselves without effort.
15,01        He had to dig through a library full of books before he was able to
15,01find a text of quantum mechanics with colour charts for nitrogen and oxygen
15,01(there were many with charts for hydrogen but hydrogen didn't make up a
15,01large enough portion of the air for him to work with.)
15,01        Memorizing the charts took a full year's work and learning to put
15,01different colours in different places to render an image that looked like
15,01something other than a multi-coloured blob of light took another. After he
15,01had all the basics down pat, he had to polish up on his artistic abilites
15,01(which were plentiful to start with) and learn the lighter side of smooth
15,01animation.
15,01        Having to concentrate on doing all these things at once (drawing images
15,01was hard enough, but having to work with oxygen intermingled with nitrogen
15,01made things considerably worse), and sometimes doing them at length sapped
15,01his strength and in particularily rough cases, gave him headaches that
15,01pulsated like a bass drum behind his temples.
15,01        Usually he used his abilities sparingly to entertain his friends with
15,01less detailed graphics but when the time came and extreme circumstances
15,01arose, he stepped on the gas and pulled out all the stops manipulating his
15,01powers to their limits, creating illusions that appeared so real that they
15,01were hard to separate from life itself.

15,01         "Cut the engine and get your hands up," Sifton said. "Slowly." He took
15,01a step back and opened the door before yanking Dennis out by the arm and
15,01flinging him front first into the side of the Lexus, kicking his feet
15,01shoulder length apart and frisking him with one hand while leaning the
15,01business end of the Franchi against the back of his neck.
15,01        Pulling a nickel-plated Beretta from the recesses of Dennis's silk
15,01jacket, Sifton dropped the gun to the ground with a clattter and then called
15,01out "The rest of you come out with your hands on your heads or else
15,01Sanderson's brains get sprayed to the four winds."
15,01        The passenger side door popped open and a man, who Sifton could only
15,01assume was Dennis's long-time partner in crime, Leonard Wu, otherwise known
15,01(for whatever reason) as Forbidden Image stepped out with one hand clamped
15,01over the base of his skull while the other held his Beretta high over his
15,01head like a dirty diaper, pinching the grip with his thumb and forefinger.
15,01        "Toss it over," Sifton said, stepping back out of Dennis's reach should
15,01he attempt to catch the gun as it flew over the car or try some other
15,01disarmament technique.
15,01        With a flick of the wrist, Forbidden Image complied, lobbing his weapon
15,01over the roof of the Lexus and into the street.
15,01        "Karen James and whoever else is in the backseat: get out before I
15,01smoke both your friends."
15,01        After a short pause, the back door on Forbidden Image's side swung
15,01slowly open and a man in a black trenchcoat pulled himself from the seat to
