15,01        Fading sunsets

15,01I once had this dream,
15,01Of a beautiful princess.
15,01Trapped in a castle of stone,
15,01Facing out to the sunset.

15,01Her face was like ivory,
15,01And her lips like berries in spring.
15,01Her eyes were like ebony gems,
15,01But her stare was so distant.

15,01I remember calling out to her.
15,01From a distance I strained
15,01Yet she was umoving,
15,01While the wind swept her hair

15,01Upon waking I saw you,
15,01With your back to the sunset
15,01I remember your tears,
15,01Sparkling under the setting sun.
