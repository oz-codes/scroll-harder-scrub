15,01I stare at the blank canvas.  So clean, pristine and white.  It stares back.

15,01Paintbrush in my hand, bathed in blue, it hungrily awaits the touch of the
15,01canvas.

15,01But I hesitate.  The perfectionist in me will not spoil the canvas.  My
15,01artistic side bravely battles the perfectionist.  But this is an old battle.
15,01The artist always goes home battered and bruised.  This time, however, the
15,01artist is strong.  This is his domain, the realm of creation.  The battle rages
15,01forth.  Me eye twitches.

15,01But to no avail.  My arm falls limply to my side.  I have no idea what to
15,01create.  Painting must not be my medium, I guess.

15,01I stare at the canvas and wonder what to do now.

15,01I struggle.

15,01And concentrate.

15,01And with a final, powerful rush of frustration, I burst forth, madly painting
15,01this and that, shapes, forms, colours, lines.  Flowing, bouncing, jumping,
15,01dancing.  The art flows like air from a punctured tire.  Within minutes, the
15,01canvas is covered, as am I, in glorious paint.

15,01I step back.

15,01And look

15,01      at what I have created

15,01             and I see..












15,01It is a piece of shit.















15,01I really should stick to writing.  Bob Ross, you suck.
