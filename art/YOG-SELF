15,01Lost

15,01The search for self becomes an oddessy to nowhere.
15,01To quest for something that you all ready have is meaningless
15,01                             open your mind to the reality of self
15,01                             don't try to find something that's
15,01                                      not
15,01                                    there.
15,01I've tried to reconsile the things I like about myself with the aspects of
15,01my personality that I don't.
15,01                            Can't be done.
15,01  But to eliminate those things           But to eliminate those things

15,01    Where is the compromise?
15,01                            How do I keep my sense of being me when trying
15,01       to change the very way I think, feel, react.


15,01  I still have far to go...will I ever get there ? Too much to do.

15,01           Will I recongnize myself when I get there?

15,01                        Hope so/not.
