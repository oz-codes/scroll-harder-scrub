15,01.:;# 00concisis15 here

15,01wo0p#@$ magma out with nother pack. Releasing our second pack, We lost a few  
15,01members cuz they decided to follow out 00disillusion15. So good luck to em 'n shit
15,01Well.. sorry about the delayed release.. computer fucked up a shitload, along
15,01with os problems.. blah.. win95 sucks cock 'n shit.. but other wise.. bo0p

15,01On the other hand, Magma expanded quite a bit. Bringing in all the ascii/ansi
15,01members of the group 00Silk15. If your interested in joining or applying, please
15,01send mail to either:
00,01              Concisis@hotmail.com15     or     00Palmore@hotmail.com
15,01or just fill out the appgen in the pack=]


15,01Magma also owes an aplogy out to 00Cardiac Arrest15. I guess I should have said
15,01something when I first noticed it before the pack came out, but I, being my
15,01stuipd lazy self=] didn't. There was some confusion to why 00Cardiac15 (the magma
15,01member) was releasing under that name when 00CA15 also did. But 00Cardiac 15is in the 
15,01process 'n shit of changing his handle (little slow at deciding=]) .. but 
15,01anyways.. sorry bout that man=]
