15,01- Banshee -


15,01Hell-fiend cackles in the night,
15,01Joining in the devil's fight.
15,01It rips your bleeding heart in two,
15,01When her screams pierce straight through you.

15,01Wailing as she twists and turns;
15,01Lightning flailing as she burns.
15,01Scream of pain - like a knife,
15,01Stabs straight through your mortal life.

15,01Satan's eyes within her head;
15,01One glimpse and you'll wish that you were dead.
15,01But if not dead, you soon will be -
15,01Damned by the hand of the devil's banshee.
