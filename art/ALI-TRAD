15,01        Tradition is going to be an alive created magazine.  It's not quite
15,01done yet, but hopefully soon you'll see the combined efforts of 6 months of
15,01alive's work and dedication in one simply mag.  The mag follows a generic
15,01iridium layout, but with side-scrolling interfaces similar to those
15,01coded by Tasmaniac/ACiD and others coded by the Tribe and Crisis guys.
15,01(I mention Tas in particular because his was all ASM and coolness.. =)
15,01But anyways, the point is our mag will be different, contain articles by all
15,01alive members, some outsiders(beastie, neurotic, ryunosuke, jello), contain
15,01the top 3 pieces of artwork from our last 5 packs, have some up to the
15,01moment of publishment news stuff.  It should be pretty k-c00l, but we need
15,01a few things from you 'outsiders' =)
15,01The following is needed from others..
