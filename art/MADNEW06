15,01         00alot DID happen this month.  I have alot to say, so I'll get right to
15,01         00the point.  This Month was the best (In MY book) for MAD.. We gained
15,01         00alot of very tallented New members (Will be named later) and had alot
15,01         00of ANSi Pics..  As for ME personaly, I let you down, once again.. since
15,01         00I was to busy to get any Personal Ansi done, But I did take care of
15,01         00everyone that needed help, or anyone that was having trouble (NT ahem).
15,01         00You don't know how much of a PAIN it is to run a group until you have
15,01         00run one yourself, just ask Nightrain.. (X:SUi) And No all you out there
15,01         00I AM NOT SAYiNG "Go out and start a New Ansi Group Just for the hell
15,01         00of it!"  Anyways, I have some explaing to do about Last months pack....

03,01"01,03@14###01@03,01m  00ast months' pack was extremely disorganized..  Included inside was a
15,01         00GIF File Called LM-SOUP.GIF Made by Lawnmower Man..  The graphics were
15,01         00"ripped" from something else, and It was not intended to go in the pack
15,01         00I am NOT Kicking anyone out of the group, But "ripping" graphics is
15,01         00wrong.  It will not happen again, and That does NOT represent MAD as
15,01         00a group that just rips shit.  I know that Lawnmower Man is a good
15,01         00artist, and He won't rip again.  I've given alot of people second
15,01         00chances, and they usualy end up doing better when someone TELLS them
15,01         00what they are doing wrong, instead of dropping them and leaving them
15,01         00hanging..  Remember what the group was founded on - "Anyone with some
15,01         00artistic tallent, that wants to Learn and GET BETTER."  Anyways, with
15,01         00the air cleared,[and I hope this serves as a good enough explanation
15,01         00for you,] we'll move on to Better news...

01,03@14#15,01 14,03#01@15,01  00ew artists, joined this month, Many from another Local group called
15,01       00SUiCiDE [SUi] (Side Note: SUiCiDE is no longer existing).  Included
15,01       00from that group is Nightrain (X:SUi Founder), A good ansi artist and a
15,01       00friend of Lupin (X:SUi) Who has also joined us..  Both of them have done
15,01       00a great job for MAD and themselves as you can see in the pack!  Lupin
15,01       00provides pics while Nightrain usualy does the fonts, they usualy work
15,01       00as a team and I am glad that they have joined up.  Also from the fall
15,01       00of SUiCiDE rises a great freehand VGA artist - NitescopE (X:SUi).  He
15,01       00delivered several nice VGA drawings this month that rounded out the pack
15,01       00perfectly..  And lastly this Month, MAD is Proud to welcome Greeper. He
15,01       00"Does" just about everything.. Included in this pack from him are .RIPS
15,01       00and Ansi files..  Great job.  That about sums it up for this months' new
15,01       00MAD artists...

15,01       00was so disorganized that the UNCOMPLETED MOD was released instead of the
15,01       00Final release, so here is the Completed Turmoil.MOD File by Doomsday.
15,01       00ALSO - - - All Sites, if you want ANY Ad's done then call The WHQ and
