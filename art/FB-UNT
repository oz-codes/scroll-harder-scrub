15,01"Untitled" Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01Moonlight stretches on as the curtain falls,
15,01the suns daily performance ends.
15,01Dreams, screams, a nightmare it seems,
15,01flutters across the back of your mind.

15,01Incandecent lights,
15,01now piercing through the night,
15,01millions, and billions of glowing distractions,
15,01making the presence known to the frail earth below.

15,01Their shining a pale memory of their life and experiences.
15,01In an instance,
15,01their unmistakeable signature ...
15,01is gone.

15,01No matter how hard we try,
15,01we can never replace them.
15,01With home, and determination,
15,01we wish to see them,
15,01Again...
15,01Alas it is too late.
15,01Death has come too soon,
15,01Again...
