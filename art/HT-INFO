00,01    Whoa! You never thought you'd see the day come, did you? Well, here it is,
00,01HEATWave Packet #04. This is a great looking pack, probably excelling the
00,01previous month's packet. Well, I have decided to discuss the issue of what it's
00,01like trying to compile a nice looking set of ten or more ANSi's by myself. At
00,01the same time, I had to balance a fifteen people/board waiting list. Sounds
00,01easy, eh?  Well, it's sure as hell not.  That is probably the reason why the
00,01HEAT packets are not going to be released on a "set" basis. Things are about to
00,01change, however, a handful of  asmall New Jersey group, (201), called
00,01Independence. This will hopefully take care of most of the delays and add a new
00,01perspective to the group.  Here's a list of the new members joining, not
00,01necessarily in any order:

00,01Boom-Boom: ANSi Artist
00,01Cyberstorm: Courier
00,01Major Pervert: ANSi/VGA
00,01Toad: ANSi Artist
00,01Cool Guy: VGA
00,01Fryar Tuck: Coder (C . C++ . Assembly)
00,01Dark Deception: ANSi Artist
00,01Lucid Nightmare: Composer
00,01Eclipse: VGA/Coder (Pascal)

00,01    On a sad note, HEAT will be dropping nearly all of its "sites" to develop
00,01a more controlled, closed system. This should hopefully develop a much easier
00,01and more efficient way to receive contributions and application for HEAT. For
00,01all who helped to support us, we regret to inform you that there will be only
00,01-ONE- HEAT site per Area Code, known as "OutPosts.." Unfortunately, we were
00,01not able to release a site list due to close to no organization by ex-SS
00,01member Bishop, who has now been retired to founder. PLEASE, all sites
00,01call and leave feedback to QuR'aN on either Harvest Moon (SysOp), or 
00,01Black Earth (HEAT WHQ)..
00,01    Finally, our HEAT World Headquarters, formerly known as Legion of Doom has
00,01changed it's name to "Black Earth" due to the recent conflict between
00,01an "out of (216)" board with the same name.. :( Also, HEAT has now dropped
00,01the high ascii characters, 'E' and 'A' with normal, capital letters. Please
00,01make appropriate changes.
00,01    Be sure to give Black Earth a call at: 216-646-1250. Also, for all
00,01of the latest news on HEAT and new packs, call the courier headquarters
00,01Harvest Moon at: 216-951-7059. For the NUP leave E-Mail to Bishop, Magnus, 
00,01or QuR'aN on any HEAT board or through the many nets that help to support us:
