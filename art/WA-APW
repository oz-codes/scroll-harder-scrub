15,01     In a perfect world, all but 12 square miles of my planet would be
15,01water.  those 12 square miles would have a mountain that took up the
15,01central 2 sq. miles, the mountain would be high enough to be snow capped,
15,01and would be covered in snow all year round, there would be a plateau at
15,01the top, just large enough for five people to lie down comfortably.  and
15,01the sides of the mountain would climb as gradually as space would allow.
15,01at the northern foot of the mountain would be a desert, which would
15,01extend until you came to the beach, which would be nothing but white sand.
15,01the southern foot would contain a forest: think new zealand, and that
15,01would extend until you came to the beach, which here: would have rocks
15,01jutting out at awkward angles for as far as you could see off the coast:
15,01which would itself be lined in much the same way, except that one would be
15,01able to stand or lie on these rocks.  the eastern foot would be a grassy
15,01plain with wild flowers and berries growing, but sparse enough to where
15,01you would always be near a place where you could lie down.  The western
15,01foot would be a sparser forest than the one in the south.  this would be
15,01less tropical and rainy than the southern forest as well, but there would
15,01always be a light sprinkling of rain, it would range from something you
15,01could hardly feel to droplets the size of tears at irregular intervals.
15,01This forest would extend until the edge of the island, where there would
15,01be nothing but a sheer cliff: think white cliffs of dover.  the only
15,01creatures on this island are spiders: these are fruit eating spiders,
15,01they are about the size of a newborn's hand; cats: all black, white, or
15,01mixed, they have no colour; ravens, rats, and fruit bats.
15,01     there is no disease here, because none has ever been introduced; and
15,01there are no men to produce any.
