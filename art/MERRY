15,01TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE FINALS
15,01============================

15,01Twas the night before finals,
15,01And all through the college,
15,01The students were praying
15,01For last minute knowledge.

15,01Most were quite sleepy,
15,01But none touched their beds,
15,01While visions of essays
15,01Danced in their heads.

15,01Out in the taverns,
15,01A few were still drinking,
15,01And hoping that liquor
15,01would loosen their thinking.

15,01In my own apartment,
15,01I long had been pacing,
15,01As dreading exams
15,01I, too, would be facing.

15,01My roommate was speechless,
15,01His nose in his books,
15,01All my comments to him
15,01Drew unfriendly looks.

15,01I drained all the coffee,
15,01And brewed a new pot,
15,01No longer caring
15,01That my nerves were shot.

15,01I stared at my notes,
15,01But my thoughts were all muddy,
15,01My eyes went ablur,
15,01I just couldn't study.

15,01"Some pizza might help,"
15,01I said with a shiver,
15,01But each place I called
15,01Refused to deliver.

15,01I'd nearly concluded
15,01That life was too cruel,
15,01With futures depending
15,01On grades had in school.

15,01When all of a sudden,
15,01Our door opened wide,
15,01And Patron Saint Put It Off
15,01Ambled inside.

15,01His spirit was careless,
15,01His manner was mellow,
15,01As a person inspired
15,01He started to bellow:
15,01  
15,01"What kind of student
15,01Would make such a fuss,
15,01To toss back at teachers
15,01What they tossed at us?"

15,01"On Cliff Notes!  On Crib Notes!
15,01On Last Year's Exams!
15,01On Wingit and Slingit,
15,01And Last Minute Crams!"

15,01His message delivered,
15,01He vanished from sight,
15,01But we heard him, still laughing,
15,01Outside in the night.

15,01"Your teachers have pegged you,
15,01So just do your best.
15,01Happy Finals to All,
15,01And to All, a good test."
