15,01--
15,01Aww shit...
15,01Bastard's probably flatlined me... can see my frackin' arm and it ain't
15,01hooked up to me no more...
15,01He's gone completely... told him not to have the sneckin' hand replaced, but
15,01would he listen to me? Not on your frackin' life... now the stupid bastard's
15,01gone completely over... complete and utter sneckin' cyberpsychosis... to much
15,01metal an' not enough man... the sneckin' cops'll just go an' blow the snecker
15,01away... but they'll have to catch him first... heh... gonna turn the town red
15,01tonight baby bro...
15,01Shit... he punched a hole in me chest... mebe they won't catch him... all he
15,01did was push me and he left me guts in me face...
15,01Frack it's cold...
15,01--
15,01The eye's of the city looked out at the creature. The street kids knew to stay
15,01away. This one was completely out of it. One didn't move fast enough. Creature
15,01had him, but who wants to stay and look?
15,01--
15,01I come down here ever night around this time. Why? The kids need it. Unless
15,01someone's there to feed them, help them - give them shelter, they'll just go
15,01the same way the last generation did. Can't have more people in the gangs.
15,01No one here tonight. Strange. Something must have happened. This place's
15,01normally packed by now. They know that I come.
15,01Jeeesus. Something's happened all right. Floor's as good as painted in blood.
15,01Oh christ... oh christ... what did this?
15,01--
15,01"Central, this is Car 23 - radiocheck."
15,01"Car 23, this is Central - coming through smooth'n clear. Whassup Strawberry?"
15,01"That you Frank? We've gotta murder. Got the aid worker that found it here."
15,01"That all? You can handle that."
15,01"Yeah - but this one looks like a cyberpsychosis case. Better let the 'Psycho
15,01squad know."
15,01"Cyberpsychosis? Christo... that's all we need - there's a Blood Razor
15,01initiation happening down Sterling. Smashing everything in their way. We're
15,01trying to keep people out of the way at the moment. No hope of stopping them."
15,01"Sterling? That's only about a block from here... if we don't look out, my
15,01psycho's gonna bump into your boostergang."
15,01"Well if he does, it'll save the 'Psycho squad a job."
15,01"Don't be too sure of that. He's left one streetkid in the ground already.
15,01Literally. Drove him all the way down into the drains. Can't find the rest of
15,01the body."
15,01--
15,01What do you think of when you imagine a Blood Razor initiation? If you're just
15,01another normal cit, you'd probably just imagine a bunch of streetpunks with
15,01claws in their fists smashin' everything in between them and the ripperdoc to
15,01hell.
15,01That's what you see. Me? I see ratings.
15,01The viewers always have liked a bit of blood.
15,01No one had EVER managed to get this close on an initiation before. For you outa
15,01townies, the Blood Razor's are Nightcity's biggest gang. Buncha psyched up
15,01punks, with claw implants in their hands. The fact they got 12 inch claws in
15,01in their fists tends to give them a bit of an advantage over most other gangs
15,01round here.
15,01As for an initiation... that's where a new member gets his claws. They start
15,01off by hacking him up a bit so he's bleedin' down in the dock area. Then they
15,01bring him uptown where they get a ripperdoc - one of those illegal surgeons -
15,01they get him to stick in the kid's claws. And anything between them and the
15,01'doc better look out. Even the cops tend to stay away. Last time they tried to
15,01stop it the gang took out half a precidinct of coppers. Man.. wish I'd got that
15,01on tape.
15,01--
15,01"Central, this is Skyeye 1 - we've got an event at the initiation."
15,01"Skyeye, this is Central - whats happening out there?"
15,01"There's a member of another gang just standing there in the way of the entire
15,01Blood Razor gang."
15,01"Bugger. That'll be Strawberry's cyberpsycho. Keep me informed."
15,01"Will do Central. This is Skyeye 1 out."
15,01--
15,01When he first appeared I couldn't believe it.
15,01Some fool was just standing in the middle of the road. Right in the way of the
15,01entire Blood Razor gang.
15,01Then I got a good look at the fool and decided maybe he wasn't. He was all
15,01chrome. Had grenade launcher hooked into his shoulder, and his wolvers were
15,01out. He almost looked like a Blood Razor. Only difference was that this guy had
15,01definately gone outa control.
15,01The Blood Razor's didn't care. They just kept on going straight through the
15,01guy. Then he opened up with the grenade launcher. Dropped a frag grenade right
