15,01Hey there, MrMr[iCE] here with a neat little christmas demo I whipped up on xmas
15,01 eve.

15,01In case your wondering what da hell this file is, its a Gameboy Advance rom file
15,01. In order to run it:

15,011) If you have a Gameboy Advance, and a special cable called the MBV2 (lik-sang.
15,01com sells them), you can
15,01   upload the file directly to the unit and view the demo as it was intended.

15,012) Download an emulator. Visualboy Advance is my weapon of choice. http://vboy.e
15,01muhq.com/downloads.shtml, get
15,01   the windows version.

15,01If developing for the gameboy advance excites you, turns you on, gives you a woo
15,01die, whatever, come see me on irc,
15,01#gbadev channel on any EFNet server. Before you take on any kind of gba developm
15,01ent, please, do not bother me with 
15,01C related questions. Knowledge of C, handling pointers, arrays, and some graphic
15,01s programming experience is a must
15,01if you plan on doing any serious development for this console. Theres also tons 
15,01of information available online for 
15,01gba development.

15,01Good places to start learning the internals of the GBA:
15,01     http://gbadev.org          <- Home of a big gba development community. Lots
15,01 of public domain roms 
15,01                                   and source code. Also host of a developers fo
15,01rum, and several user webpages.
15,01     http://devrs.com/gba       <- Another repository for development, has a ver
15,01y good FAQ on compiling, 
15,01                                   dev kits, and hardware spec documents on the 
15,01GBA
15,01     http://thepernproject.com  <- excellent tutorial pages, most of what I've l
15,01earned about the gba started here.


15,01For gba devkits, theres:
15,01   ARM SDT, which is not free (but supposedly the best compiler suited for ARM c
15,01pus)

15,01   DevKit Advance, a gnu based package. This is what I used for the xmas demo, a
15,01nd all other projects I've worked
15,01        on for the GBA. Theres even a page that shows how to integrate gcc proje
15,01cts with Visual Studio.

15,01   Goldroad, a standalone assembler for gba roms. This compiles assembly code on
15,01ly, and it does not generate binaries
15,01        compatible with GCC or arm sdt...only the hardcore, criminally insane co
15,01ders use this.
