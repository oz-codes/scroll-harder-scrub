00,01                                 The Seven

00,01     The wind blew through his hair, his ragged clothing flapping in the 
00,01wind. Dark eyes stared from under his brow, a deep scar traced its way
00,01down over his eye, to his chin. The mark of The Darken. He stood seven feet
00,01tall, towering over any mortal. His strength made legends over the land. 
00,01People had no idea how right they were.
00,01     Dark clouds began to roll in over the hillside where he stood. He 
00,01glanced upward, watching the blackened puffs stretch across the vastness     
00,01of the sky, being pulled and shaped like cotton. As a fresh, cool breeze
00,01washed over him, he breathed deeply, feeling better. 
00,01     He saw a movement out of the corner of his eye, far down the hill. He
00,01looked over and caught a glimpse of a large man with a battleaxe strapped to
00,01his back. Rent. A great man if ever there was one. Huge, compared to a 
00,01human. Rent was still no competition, and he knew it. Rent was just as
00,01aware of this fact as he. Rent was no match for The Paladin. 
00,01     He grabbed the mans hand, helping him up the peak, and asked if he had
00,01seen the rest of The Seven. 
00,01     "I have seen no one, lord, save some poor peasants and the like. They
00,01shall be here, rest assured."
00,01     "I know that. But when?" The Paladin stared at Rent coldly, making sure 
00,01that his dominance was secured. There was no rebellion in Rent's eyes. Only
00,01fear. The Paladin softened his hard gaze, then turned away, satisfied. 
00,01     "When I expect them at a specific time, they should be here. Ahh, there
00,01they are. I see two. I believe that is Aa'rdross and Sadon."
00,01     Rent looked to the north side of the cliff, watching Sadon barely
00,01sprawling out of Aa'rdross' grasp. Sadon would proceed to attempt to push
00,01him down the hillside, failing each time. 
00,01     He could barely remember the last time he had seen Aa'rdross. The last
00,01time he had seen him was by the light of a burning city. Granoith, he      
00,01thought. Aa'rdross was the best soldier he had known in his life. Second only
00,01to the Paladin, he supposed. Watching his dark form lumber up the hill 
00,01brought back memories he had long forgot. The days of their glory. When 
00,01blood flowed freely in the streets, and anarchy reigned. Although he had to
00,01admit, the humans were doing pretty much the same job they had, in the name
00,01of the "government". He laughed a little.
00,01     Sadon, a skinny one, jumped out of Aa'rdross' palms way again, almost
00,01tripping on his own feet. As he stumbled forward trying to catch his balance
00,01Aa'rdross reached out to push him off, but Sadon, as nimbly as possible
00,01under the circumstances, jumped out of reach.
00,01     Sadon, he remembered some. Not his favorite out of the group. Not ever.
00,01The skinny punk was always whining, and often in the way. He made cracks
00,01he could never dream to back up. Unfortunatly, his skill with the bow was
00,01unequaled. Other than that, he was merely a coward, meant to be crushed in 
00,01the long run. 
00,01     The wind shrieked across the grassland, the green waves rolling into the
00,01distance. The clouds ran faster, mutating into deformed objects. The mutating
00,01puffs began to darken, greying and rumbling threateningly. There was a huge 
00,01black cloud on the horizon.   
00,01     A shadowed form appeared on the hill, slowly trudging its way up. Next
00,01to it stood a smaller, hugely muscled figure. Nargos and Stonewright. Nargos,
00,01the slightly less built one, shifted his polearm to his right hand, and waved
00,01toward the Paladin. The smaller figure, Stonewright, glanced up at the 
00,01Paladin and waved as well, losing his grip on his huge double edged axe. He
00,01fumbled for it, caught it, and grinned at Nargos.
00,01     Nargos was small, may be five foot eight or so, but he was viscious. He
00,01carried a hooked polearm, with witch in a fight he would proceed to tear out    
00,01the intestines and anything else that caught to the steel hook out of your
00,01system. He delighted in torture, used jagged, rusty kriss daggers where he 
00,01could, and broke as many bones as possible before killing his victims.
00,01     Stonewright, on the other hand, carried a large hammer. But his attitude
00,01was much the same as Nargos's. Which was why they always travelled together. 
00,01Stonewright was only four foot four inches, perhaps, but he was as heavy as 
00,01an ox. He could almost match the Paladins strength with the help of a certain
00,01magical bracer. He carried his hammer for the thrill of hearing shrieks of 
00,01pain when someones arm was crushed into small, jagged chunks of bone. 
00,01     They were all here. Except one. Diacho. A master theif, if there ever 
00,01was one. He could slip in and out of your house without disturbing the dust. 
00,01Which was the problem. He delighted in surprise attacks, jamming his kriss
00,01dagger into the ribs of an enemy, and twisting. He also loved to hide. Now
00,01was not the time. They had to begin.
00,01     He shouted to Nargos, asking where Diacho was. Nargos mearly shrugged,
00,01as the Paladin had expected. Not an easy one to find. He yelled for Diacho,
00,01out into the wind. The clouds began to drop rain into the feild, pelting 
00,01them all. A bolt of lightning tore into the sky, screaching and crackling.
00,01     A black cloaked figure slid from the shadows, like a wraith, and stood
00,01by the grove of trees. He grinned and waved, pulling the hood from his head,
00,01and jumped forth into the group. Each one stepped back from eachother, 
00,01forming a small circle. As the Paladin stepped to the middle, a bolt of light
00,01ripped across the sky, followed by a resounding explosion of sound. They
