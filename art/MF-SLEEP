15,01Sleep
15,01Suddenly the seemingly conscious
15,01turns gray- sleep
15,01The new conscious, failing to give up, mingles
15,01with the old- sleep
15,01The two blend, giving a subconscious feeling halfway
15,01between nothingness and infinity- sleep
15,01The cold air causes uncomfort as you realize 
15,01the barrier between the seemingly conscious and 
15,01conscious reality has been misplaced- sleep
15,01Struggling, reaching, groping, your hand feels for 
15,01the barrier- sleep
15,01Your hand obtains the barrier pulling it
15,01to proper position- sleep
15,01Still dark, the conscious reality fails to
15,01call you to awakening- sleep
15,01Comfort at hand, time and space lose meaning as
15,01seemingly conscious takes control again- sleep
