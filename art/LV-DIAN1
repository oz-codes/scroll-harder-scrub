15,01                            Diane

15,01Black as the night
15,01her ebony hair falls
15,01'round her sculpted shoulders
15,01her luminous eyes
15,01drawing your glance
15,01but you won't get a second chance

15,01in a minute she's gone
15,01faded away like a dream
15,01a fleeting glimpse of beauty
15,01just a passing image
15,01in your mind's eye
15,01enough to make you want to cry

15,01not tears of sorrow
15,01but tears of joy and awe
15,01dazzled by what you saw
15,01wondering if she was real
15,01trying so hard to feel
15,01but she's far away now

15,01tomorrow night
15,01as you're drifting off to sleep
15,01just before you begin to dream
15,01just for a minute it will begin to seem
15,01like she is with you
15,01walking side by side
15,01wishing it would never end
15,01until the day you have died.
