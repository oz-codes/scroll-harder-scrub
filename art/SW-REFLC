15,01- Reflections -



15,01What is there that makes you cry;
15,01Tears are welling up inside.
15,01What has broken perfect affection;
15,01Time or fate or introspection?
15,01Why don't you laugh as you used to;
15,01Seems like your heart is split in two -
15,01Have you lost a friend or lost control;
15,01Pain of silence in your soul.

15,01In your heart, renew your strength,
15,01As reflection brings you to the brink;
15,01Stare into the ocean of the heart,
15,01And let the waves cleanse every part.
15,01Awaken the soul and let it be free,
15,01And drown your regrets in the infinite sea.

15,01Look toward the dawn and the birth of tomorrow;
15,01Stare to the sun and release all your sorrows.
15,01Let loose your last pain as the final tear falls
15,01And you become one with the grace that recaptures us all.
