15,01        With the aid of the RenderMan Companion, some
15,01        Siggraph papers, the gurus of
15,01        comp.graphics.rendering.renderman, and most
15,01        notably Larry Gritz, I have spend the past couple
15,01        of months learning to use RenderMan. In the
15,01        process I've experimented by coding several
15,01        shaders to accomplish specific tasks. Some shaders
15,01        were a success, while others returned abysmal
15,01        results. I continue to learn and experiment with
15,01        shaders, and probably never will finish learning
15,01        what can be achieved through RenderMan. "Miss
15,01        Piggy" is a result of my education, my
15,01        experimentation, and the shaders that worked.

15,01        editors note: If you don't have a Quicktime 3
15,01        compatable viewer, you're gonna have a real tough
15,01        time viewing this.
