10,01r11e15ality blurs and becomes undefined,
10,01t11h15ought and perseption become all combined.
10,01t11i15me stands still as space closes in,
10,01v11i15sions and sounds seep in through your skin.
10,01b11o15underies form to create the divisions,
10,01s11o15on crashing down to destroy the partitions.
10,01t11h15e patterns continue, increasing in speed,
10,01y11o15ur unsure what to think, to scream or to bleed.
10,01r11e15ality still bending, your body 'comes numb,
10,01f11u15nctions cease, you're blind, deaf and dumb.
10,01a 15state of despair, the feeling so strange,

10,01y11o15ur vision returns, yet the light is still blinding,
10,01m11o15vement returns, shackles no longer binding.
10,01y11o15ur hearing grows stronger, you let out a scream.
10,01t11h15e threads recompile, your conscience now clean.
10,01t11h15e intense light diminishes, objects take shape,
10,01y11o15ur feet become planted, you've escaped your dull fate.
10,01y11o15u've stood your ground with a strong will to survive,
10,01y11o15u open your eyes, your soul still alive.
10,01y11o15u wonder what happened, perhaps just a vision,
