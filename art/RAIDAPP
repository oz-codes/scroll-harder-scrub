12,01   00 12He02re it is!
00,01  12 00 12--02---------

00,01      12 He02re it is, our first application generator which should have been
00,01    02included in the last pack, but because of one fat lazy-assed guy (me?)
00,01    02we ran out of time last month, so here it is now.. this app-gen will be
15,01    02included in all the future raid packs. 15 02You probably know what to do with
02,01    these things already, but I'll go through it again anyway.. my job :)


00,01    12He02re's what you do
00,01    12--02----------------

00,01        12Fi02rst you load up the program (if you don't know how then need not 
02,01    apply :) and you should see a menu with all the options that are available15 
00,01    02for you. What you do is simply move the cursor (watch the kid's eyes 
02,01    carefully!) to the option you want and press <ENTER>. Next you will see 
00,01    02all sorts of questions that must all be answered, truthfully & to best
02,01    of your ability. If any invalid/false information is given, your applicatio
02,01    will be void, and we'll post it up on our net and laugh at it =) J/K


15,01    12It02's time for delivery
15,01    12--02--------------------

00,01        12Ok02ay, so you filled in everything, now it's time to deliver your      15 
00,01    02application to our WHQ so that we can process your application.15 02The number15 
00,01    02is listed at the very bottom. All you have to do is simply zip up
02,01    your application file, preferably with some sample works (include some of  
02,01    your best works).
