15,01lost soul

15,01i let these waves of poverty, wash upon the sand
15,01i let depressions helplessness, sweep across the land
15,01   i weep all night unto the morrow
15,01   weep out all my bitter sorrow
15,01   misery, i must endeavour
15,01   in your arms i'd sleep forever
15,01   thoughts of you and all that's lost
15,01   thoughts of all the lines i crossed
15,01   once i would have loved you so
15,01   now i have to let you go
15,01   i'm in such pain, i can't live on
15,01   please kiss me once before i'm gone
15,01   deep inside there grows such irony
15,01   as you would not know; such tyranny
15,01   pain i've never felt before
15,01   pain forthcoming evermore
15,01   pain that never ends; it seems
15,01   it's agony invades my dreams
15,01   yet you, my love, shall never care
15,01   what is, or what was ever there.
15,01i see these storms of poverty, crash from above
15,01i see but one soul suffering; you, the one i love.
