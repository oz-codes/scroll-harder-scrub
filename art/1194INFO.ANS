14,01   15Welcome to another month of listening to The Guardian tell you things about
15,01shiver that you really dont want to hear or care about! elite eh?
15,01   Anyways, lets begin shall we?  This has been a very active month in
15,01shiver, as is every month.  First off, we have went through a MASSIVE user
15,01purge.  It seems as though almost 1/2 of the members in Shiver havent done
15,01a single thing in 3 to 4 months.  Shiver has always been one of the most laid
15,01back groups in the scene.  We have no deadlines whatsoever, we tell people they
15,01should try to make 1 piece of work in 4 months or so, and yet they still dont
15,01seem to complete the simple job.  Thus it is my interpretation that alot of
15,01these people just joined for the affiliation.  25 members from Shiver have been
15,01disbanded from the group.  It was not an easy task doing this, considering many
15,01of these people I have become good friends with, but as you all know, shiver had
15,01way to many members,  (we still do, but thats beside the point :) and it was
15,01time for a change.  Many coordinator positions have been changed around, and
15,01we have spent many days getting everything organized.  Check the current
15,01member list to see where you stand.  If your name is still in the member list,
15,01you are still in shiver, and everything is the same.  But if you are not in the
15,01member list, then you have unfortunatly been disbanded.
15,01  Next on the agenda, is the resignition of proze from shiver.  Unfortunatly
15,01Proze has too much going on in life, to even turn on the computer, so he felt
15,01it neccessary to resign from shiver.  He was one of the founders of shiver,
15,01along with me, and has been with us since the beginning.  He will truly be
15,01missed more than he can imagine by all...
15,01  With the removal of proze, the lit department, was definatly falling apart,
15,01as you could tell in the last pack by the rather low quality of literature.  We
15,01decided that it was best to abolish the lit section, considering our literature
15,01department was so horrid, and that the writers deserved a group with a better
15,01lit section than what we had to offer.  Maybe one day we will bring it back, who
15,01knows...
15,01  We gained some extrodinary talent this month in shiver.  Who you ask?  Just
15,01sit right back and ill tell ya!  First off we gained one of the last 320x VGA
15,01artists in the scene :) Ackman From VOR, brings us some great needed help
15,01in the vga department, and Phatal from a local group called "LiD" joins us,
15,01also helping our vga department get stronger. (which we really need.. so if
15,01your a vga artist looking for a group come to us! :) We have some fantastic
15,01additions to the ansi department this month.  One of the best upcoming ansi
15,01artists I have seen comes to us, by the name of Crimson Ryder.   This guy is
15,01AMAZING.  He just popped out of nowhere, bringing us some fantastic art work,
15,01as you can see in this pack.  He is truly one of the greatest additions to
15,01the shiver ansi division.  Also this month comes Creep from a disbanded group
15,01called "MiiS".  He joined us as a logo artist only, but as you can tell by his
15,01ansi in this pack, he can really draw pictures quite good also!  Another ansi
15,01artist named Demonseed joined us, who should have some great work to show us
15,01next month, and Galahad from "ROC" has joined us, and will split up the ansis
15,01he makes between the two groups.  A great guy named Distemper from up in Canada
15,01also joins our evergrowing ansi section, An Jack Daniels also ganged up with the
15,01shiver ansi crew this month.  This guy really has a phunky euro stile, and I
15,01cant wait too see what he pops out next!  Killraven from former EMPiRE SS also
15,01joins us, after a long abstance from the ansi scene, and boy what an honor it
15,01is to have him.  Thanks for choosing us man!  One of the most productive shiver
15,01members I have seen this month is Mephitopeles who really worked his ass off
15,01making many ansis, for his arrival.  Shatter Shot From Justice also joins up
15,01with the ranks of shiver.  And last but not least, Sub Zerox joins shiver,
15,01as a great ansi artist, and a great ansi coordinator. (due to the fact our ansi
15,01division is so large, he will be splitting the job with DarkSword) And last but
15,01not least comes Slayer from Australia.  He is truly a gift from god to our
15,01couriering department.  He will courier our packs to all our international
15,01sites, and is the new courier coordinator.  We need more couriers like this in
15,01shiver! :)  Great to have ya man!
15,01  Also Id like to give a hats off to Cyric for making Shiver View, in my opinion
15,01one of the best viewers in the scene today.  It now has RIP and BIN support,
15,01which everyone asked for, and has a great new interface made by muh :) Also in
15,01the news Spectre changed his handle to Invisible Anarchy.
15,01  I tried to keep this as short as possible, but obviously I didnt do a very
15,01good job of it <g> To make a long story short, all is well in shiver and expect
15,01another fantastic pack next month!  Until the next...
