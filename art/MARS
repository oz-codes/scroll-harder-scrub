15,01Don't look at me
15,01with your eyes
15,01when sanity swoons
15,01a door unlocked
15,01keep the children
15,01playing
15,01distant mad capped games
15,01in the woods
15,01how small the world in our
15,01memories
15,01our minds ablaze
15,01with passions looking back
15,01we dream of vast delights
15,01of which we know no name
15,01it is an angel with authority
15,01a travelers vacant tale
15,01in the empty Inn
15,01by the side of the road
15,01music is the only
15,01food
15,01we discover
15,01in our work alone
15,01a romantic longing for escape
15,01we die a little every day
15,01on this vast plain
15,01where winds blow long and true
15,01a distance is a measure
15,01of a mans mind
15,01I love you when
15,01your eyes fill
15,01and let slip
15,01a rain of tears
15,01warm as blood
15,01a dark beggar motions to the young girl
15,01she aproches shakily
15,01this ring
15,01the beggar says squezing each word out
15,01is for you
15,01I have kept it for years
15,01just for you
15,01I was waiting for you
15,01how you would please me
15,01were I young again
15,01when I first caught sight of you
15,01because I was seeking the dark
15,01but, I found you
15,01and earth
15,01was changed into a prison cell
15,01so tonight, after 65 years of searching
15,01I give you this ring
15,01that i bought,
15,01the first time the vision of you entered my mind

15,01Sounds like the rattle of a wounded man
15,01Left by a pool of blood, beneath the dead,
15,01Who dies, quite still, his desperate struggle made
