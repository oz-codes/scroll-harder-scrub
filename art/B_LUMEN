15,01                Lumen

15,01Across the craters of a dusty grey sea
15,01Back to the Dark Side that's where I'll be
15,01If you want to find me, you won't find me soon
15,01Going home to Lumen, home to the moon

15,01Littered with golfballs, flags and a plaque
15,01Another few craters and maybe she'll crack
15,01If you want to come visit, come visit me please
15,01Come home to the moon, the place of blue cheese

15,01Come visit Lumen, we aren't really green
15,01Those are the Martians, the few that we've seen
15,01Come home to the moon and visit this summer
15,01Just bring your own gas, or you're in for a bummer.
