15,01                              14Is cruel you know,
15,01                             03The sorrow, the hurt,
15,01                            14And all else won't go.
15,01                           03It stays there, reamins,
15,01                             14As if frozen in ice,
15,01                          03From the cold of the heart,
15,01                         14Whose feelings were concise.
15,01                            03The pain and the hurt,
15,01                              14Just won't go away,
15,01                           03It'll haunt you forever,
15,01                          14And forever you shall pay.
15,01                            03The tears and the ache,
15,01                           14Which never shall cease,
15,01                           03You scream one last word,
15,01                         14But all you utter is "please."
15,01                             03Your heart caves in,
15,01                              14Falling like rain,
15,01                            03You know you're now in,
15,01                              14The House of Pain.
