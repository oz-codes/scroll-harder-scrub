15,01I decided to ad this file even tho it originally wasn't meant to
15,01be released.

15,01---START: CORP HISTORY & INFO

15,01The concept CORP first came up as back in '92 when the ansi scene
15,01was greatly different from what it is nowadays. The idea was to
15,01compete with groups like iCE and ACiD. The group consisted of 100%
15,01European drawers. The thought of releasing a pack with 5 drawers as
15,01we did in January '93 is unbearable today and we only managed it
15,01because we had a lot of old stuff 'stacked' away. After the first
15,01pack came out I was contacted by iCE and we decided to merge the
15,01group into iCE to form the iCE European division. The decision was
15,01made because we realised we wouldn't be able to release a pack monthly
15,01(which I doubt we can even do with our new crew, unless some new
15,01talent joins the group). After being in iCE for just a wee bit over
15,01a year I decided to join the group for reasons which I won't go into
15,01now. The idea of putting CORP back together had been in mind for a
15,01while but I decided I wouldn't jump out of iCE since they had helped
15,01me a lot too. So in January '93 I finally left iCE and after contacting
15,01all the old CORP members and talking to them about putting the old
15,01team back together we decided to reform CORP. What inspired me to this
15,01was because I had inquired a few new drawers about the possibility of
15,01them joining the group and they agreed. So now we have 10 drawers
15,01alltogether instead of the original 5. I admit that this might not be
15,01a staff large enough to put out a monthly compilation but we will sure
15,01as hell try. In my year in iCE I learned a lot of stuff about ansis,
15,01about running a group and of the scene itself. The scene in the USA
15,01is a lot different from the scene in Europe and the main difference
15,01is that people jump from one group to another like if it was the same
15,01thing as eating breakfast. I myself have decided to keep CORP as a
15,01group where it is fun to be in. I wan't to keep CORP as a team that
15,01everybody likes which is why I've decided 1) NOT to ask a member of
15,01any team to join the group and quit his own group, I will accept
15,01any drawers who qualify to the group, but the decision will be THEIRS
15,01to leave their former group. 2) The CORP Compilation is supposed to
15,01be a monthly release which I highly doubt it will be unless we acquire
15,01new members but it is still meant to be an ANSI art release. The pack
15,01won't be stuffed up with lame gif's, jpg's or modules. The only art
15,01form varying from ansi will be ascii, amiga-ansi and rip(this is
15,01to keep the pack from growing to over 500k). I won't accept any criticism
15,01about the size of the packs because ansi files do not take much room
15,01zipped. 3) Most of the foreign affairs will be handled via the internet
15,01since communication is a very important aspect in a group which originates
15,01from Europe and I wan't to keep all the foreign members and sites up-to-date
15,01about what's happening, the easiest way to do this is by using the internet.
15,01Of course other means of communication are also used but internet is the main
15,01link.
