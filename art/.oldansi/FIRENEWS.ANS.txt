03,01    00Happy hollidays, everyone.  It's been a hell of a short and confusing
00,01    month for us fire peoples.  We ran into some early difficulties with
00,01    thanksgiving vacations and the fact that The Regency (our app HQ) was
00,01    down for over 2 weeks. (great timing.)  It seems like only 2 weeks ago
00,01    we released our last pack.

00,01    Besides all the well-known hollidays of this time of year, it is also
00,01    our 6 month aniversary. w00! It's actually pretty hard to believe that
00,01    we're still here.. :)

00,01    15New members:

15,01         00Pale - For the first time, fire actually has an artist from outside
15,01                00of 404!  Most of you are probably saying "who cares?" but
15,01                00until this pack, all of our artists have come from the same
15,01                0030-or-so mile radius. :)

00,01    15News about old members:

15,01         00Prisoner#1 - P1 closes off the year with a bang with his entry
15,01                00into Union, one of the foremost groups in the ansi scene.
15,01                00The entire fire staff wishes him luck and hopes that his
15,01                00skills will continue to improve at the remarkable rate that
15,01                00they have been ..

15,01         00Wintemute - WM earns a biiig cookie this month for his attempt at
15,01                00RIP support in Pyroview.  At this point, we're not even sure
15,01                00if it works, but it sure as hell took a long time to get
15,01                00even this close to having it. :)

15,01         00Phusion - PH earns a nice smack for changing his handle.  He's now
15,01                00going by the (I think) retarded handle of "Coolwhip."  Ack.
15,01                00Ryan's a weirdo. :)

15,01         00Halaster - I got my damn wisdom teeth pulled (all four of them) and
15,01                00they hurt like fucking hell.  I still drew, however, unlike..

15,01         00Donut Hole - The laziest senior staffer that fire has ever had. :>
15,01                00(just boltzing ya, dh.)

00,01    On that jubilant note, I cordially invite you to run Pyroview, if you
00,01    haven't already, and see the terrific winter-theme interface.  WM and I
00,01    spent a lot of time on it, and I'm afraid we'd have to kick your ass if
00,01    you happened to skip over it.

15,01                                      00A lump of coal to all of you. :)
