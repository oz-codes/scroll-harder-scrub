15,01You and I,
15,01We should meet in the air
15,01On the beach, where the sea
15,01Shall carress our toes.

15,01You and I,
15,01We meet on these streets
15,01Covered with butts and spit
15,01And separated by my word.

15,01Words, words, word,
15,01Shut up and kiss me for once.
15,01Not a stolen one, but a blatant
15,01500 WATT shown at half-time during the Superbowl
15,01Kiss from your lips to mine
15,01it leaps across the electric air between us.

15,01My word that ties my fingers
15,01Into his and does not allow mine
15,01to wander in and out of your hair and soul.

15,01-Not really from afar, but far enough for longing.
