15,01Waiting for Love
15,01----------------

15,01I haven't found someone to love,
15,01Each time I thought I had
15,01Something went wrong.

15,01It's within my grasp,
15,01Then it flitters away,
15,01Flying to someone else's heart.

15,01The closer happiness gets,
15,01The more it hurts when it leaves.
15,01The pain I feel breaks my heart another time.

15,01Love, they say, takes time but
15,01The days are so long,
15,01Waiting seems like forever.
