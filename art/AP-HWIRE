15,01       Within the cold steel labrynth of your breast
15,01       00where phantoms of derision come to play.
15,01       The hatred that you harbor makes it's nest
15,01       00Within the confines of your head it stays.
15,01       You've played their tired game for far to long
15,01       00a victim of their prejudice laced spite.
15,01       And now the heaven's tremble with your song
15,01       00as those who called you monster flee from sight
15,01       With apathy your only friend you weep.
15,01       00With iron ore and copper wire feel.
15,01       With irony and ignorance must sleep.
15,01       00With softest whisper saying "I am REAL!"
15,01       Desires of the flesh unknown to thee
15,01       00Tears that stain the alloy, shall make you free.
