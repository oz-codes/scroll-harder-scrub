15,01 00When will the Pain Stop?

00,01I was confronted by a boy,
00,01with an unanswerable question.
00,01When does it stop?
00,01The pain devouring my soul,
00,01never giving me a moment to remember,
00,01or to be free within a thought.

00,01I replied back..
00,01You talk of a carnal pain,
00,01but what about the rage?
00,01When will the children stop dieing,
00,01and malice leave us to be free.
00,01Societies evil standards,
00,01which make us all lemmings.
00,01Dare to be different,
00,01prepare for rejection.
00,01The pain of death,
00,01or a child's tear falling upon me.

00,01This is the pain I can't forget,
00,01when I contemplate my life.
00,01Although so hard I have to reply back
00,01it never does stop,
00,01till we lay down for our eternal sleep.
