15,01        Dennis had slowed down a bit and Karen was no longer being thrown all
15,01over the backseat. The three of them remained silent for most of the way
15,01with Dennis and Forbidden Image exchanging the odd comment here and there.
15,01        As the Lexus rolled through an intersection, the headlights of a car
15,01parked facing the wrong way at the side of the road came into view. From the
15,01other side came the dim glow of the tail-lights of a second car, also parked
15,01facing the wrong way, watching over traffic coming in the opposite direction
15,01of which there was none.
15,01        "Roadblock," Dennis stated and opened the dashboard's ashtray. He
15,01pushed in the lighter and gave it a half-twist counterclockwise. A piece of
15,01the ceiling above his head between the top of the windshield and the sunroof
15,01slid quietly open revealing a panel of unlabelled square buttons of various
15,01colours and some round, white buttons, distinctly separate from the square
15,01ones and labelled with tiny black letters.
15,01        "What's that?" Karen asked.
15,01        "It's my James Bond rig," he replied and pushed a square blue button
15,01marked with an A.
15,01        "Yeah? Go on," Karen said. She was a big fan of spy movies and loved
15,01all the trick contraptions in them.
15,01        "A cute little device that your man Steve designed for me," Dennis told
15,01her.
15,01        Karen's interest was peaked further.
15,01        Slowing the car down subtly, Dennis continued: "He got the idea from a
15,01toy car he found in a basement some time ago which changed colour when
15,01immersed in warm water. He took a bit of the paint to a lab for analysis and
15,01then reproduced a more advanced version of the stuff which was able to
15,01change into eight different colours at various temperatures. I tried to buy
15,01the formula off him but..." he sighed, "no sale.
15,01        "Anyway, the rig he made for my car required the total dismantling of
15,01the body. He welded strips of electric stove ring material on the inside,
15,01pieced my car back together and repainted it with his chameleon paint in
15,01exchange for a small warehouse full of ordinance."
15,01        "Then what does that button do?"
15,01        "You can think of the changes as eight rungs of a ladder. At a certain
15,01temperature, the colour shifts up or down a rung, but what colour it changes
15,01to isn't predetermined. A dye has to be added in the manufacturing process
15,01to program each rung for a certain colour. The first colour is black and
15,01works for temperatures of 20*C or less. The second was what I just pushed
15,01and it has different colours painted in different places. When the
15,01temperature of the body hits 21*C, the car changes to look like one of the
15,01Aurora patrol cars. Half of Steve's price was for doing that one alone.
15,01Anyway, that's pretty much all that he told me. If you still don't get it,
15,01ask him yourself."
15,01        Karen nodded. "What are the white buttons for?"
15,01        "Machine guns up front; smoke, oil, nitro and road tacks in the back."
15,01        She whistled, impressed. "Wow. Is there anything that this car DOESN'T
15,01have?"
15,01        "Trunk space," he answered.
15,01        They drove up to the roadblock slowly enough for the Headhunters on
15,01duty to clearly see the Aurora logo on the hood and doors.
15,01        They waved the Lexus through and continued to stare down the street at
15,01nothing.

15,01        Elminster's head swam and a buzzing mist of static filled his ears. He
15,01opened his eyes slightly and groggily looked around.
15,01        By the light of a small light-bulb fixed into the ceiling, he could see
15,01he was dressed in a yellowing white straitjacket and his legs were cuffed to
15,01the floor of the vehicle that he was riding in.
15,01        Two of the Firecackers shared the bench space with him, one on either
15,01side and both staring out the small glass window opposite them.
15,01        It was still night and they were travelling through an area void of 
15,01street lamps. Off in the distance, tiny specks of light twinkled like fallen
15,01stars. 
15,01        From the rear of the transport came the steady roar of at least one
15,01outboard motor. They were in a transport skiff, skimming across what he
15,01guessed to be Lake Ontario, headed to wherever.
15,01        Elminster closed his eyes and fought back a pain-induced groan. His
15,01head seemed to be the only thing working -- just barely. The rest of his
15,01body was numb and stiff.
15,01        A click came from a small, rectangular speaker set into the ceiling,
15,01followed by a voice that said "It's 0100. Shoot him again."
15,01        Before Elminster could react, a pair of hands held his head from one
