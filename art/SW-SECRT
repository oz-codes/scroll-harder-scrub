15,01DJC1.PCX :      This was the first VGA I drew.  This "Bucky" character
15,01                was from a hand-drawn comic that I put together in 1988.  
15,01                I just transfered it over from paper to screen pixel by pixel,
15,01                and took me probably 2 or 3 weeks.  Not too horrible for a 
15,01                first heh?  :D   [DJC: Laser's Realm 1990-1992]

15,01DJC2.PCX :      This was when I first started experienmenting with computer-
15,01                aided stuffs.  HAHAHAHAHA...a very silly attempt heh?  :D

15,01ACiD.PCX :      I drew this different rendition of the "Bucky" character to
15,01                mock one of my old B-Ball favorites...Charles Barkley.
15,01                :D
