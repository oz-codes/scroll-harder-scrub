15,01                Stinking of Jaguars anal cavaties,
15,01                Slasher takes a bloody oath,
15,01                To serve the philosophy of lamity,
15,01                Forever being the greatest joke.

15,01                With a pickle up his ugly ass,
15,01                Jaguar swears he isn't lame,
15,01                The responsibilty does he pass;
15,01                Slasher's the one to blame!

15,01                Oh MuNE, with an idiotic stoop,
15,01                You claim you do it all.
15,01                You're only a queer little group,
15,01                Who surely will fall.

15,01                Chaos Breed is on your back,
15,01                (You feel you're going to cry),
15,01                For talent do you lack,
15,01                So don't even try.

15,01                Your little friends, those precious few,
15,01                Can't save your precious souls;
15,01                RaGE is falling on lamers like you,
15,01                Like a pile of heated coals..
