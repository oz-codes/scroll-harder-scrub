15,01i.

15,01staring at the summer haze, summer haze
15,01shiny fuzzy shifting patterns cloud my gaze
15,01and I think of the girl, the girl
15,01she rocked me hard oh yeah, she rocked my world

15,01well it's hard to see, oh yeah
15,01it's just so hard to be me
15,01stuff goes on but I don't care
15,01better to act like I'm not there

15,01my vision wavers like rippling waves
15,01on the sea of ultraviolet haze
15,01sailing off the edge, oh my
15,01taking off into the sky

15,01ii.

15,01events and faces, people and places
15,01newspaper headlines are jumbles of letters
15,01all stuck together they make no sense
15,01you follow them blindly without pretense

15,01make a world for yourself
15,01slip out of life
15,01connect to a new place
15,01away from the human race

15,01ever have fantasies about medieval battles?
15,01you're there
15,01ever want to roam the galaxies on a starship?
15,01you're there
15,01think you could cross the burning Sahara?
15,01oh yeah?
15,01diving deep underneath the ocean?
15,01it's not a truly crazy notion

15,01the rat race, the hustle and bustle
15,01the self-defeating cycles of boredom we call our lives
15,01aren't worth a half-baked squirt of chicken piss
15,01we were given our minds for a purpose
15,01and it was not to live the same way day in and day out
15,01to go through the same motions every single morning
15,01every afternoon and night, the daily plan
15,01which is the downfall of man
15,01now that we've contained ourselves in a mindless circle
15,01it's so easy to sit back and forget what it is we're doing
15,01to not actually realize how we're wasting our lives
15,01slaving away at the nine-to-five
15,01you might as well bury yourself alive
15,01going to school so you can get into yet another school
15,01does a higher education make you any less of a fool?
15,01So you can perform a flawless triple bypass, who cares.
15,01You can do your own accounting? Don't make me yawn.
15,01You've memorized every significant date in history? Wow.
15,01These great accomplishments of yours don't mean a thing to me
15,01Try doing something new that no one else has ever done.
15,01You went to school for 23 years and read lots of books.
15,01You followed all the instructions on how to become successful
15,01and where have you ended up?
15,01you have a steady job, with good pay
15,01in fact, you're there every day
15,01working away, never living for today
15,01always trying to secure a perfect future for yourself
15,01well guess what?
15,01YOU'RE ALREADY TOO LATE
15,01by the time you build up a nice fat retirement fund,
15,01you'll finally realize that you haven't DONE ANYTHING
15,01you've wasted your life
15,01going to school so you could get into college
15,01going to college so you could get a higher education
15,01getting a higher education to land yourself a good job
15,01working at that job for years upon years upon years
15,01at about age eighty you'll start having the fears
15,01of knowing it's too late to do anything worthwhile
15,01the chances you passed up as a child
15,01a teenager who did all his homework every night before eight
15,01a young adult who had so much wonderful self-discipline
15,01an up-and-coming agent who was making so much money
