15,01[installation]-------------------------------------------------------------

15,01        put the newuser.ans in \ra\txtfiles and newuser.q-a in whatever
15,01        path you've got defined as your questionnaire path.  if you can't
15,01        figure that out, you must be just a 12 year-old kid who wants to
15,01        be k-r@d 3771T3 by setting up your own board, and shouldn't be
15,01        reading ra's docs instead.  there are just too many lame boards
15,01        out there already.

15,01        remote access recognizes this file name in its' coding, so you 
15,01        don't need to put anything in your menus regarding it, which is
15,01        convenient.  whenever a new user logs in, he'll have to fill it
15,01        out.  

15,01        change the ansi.  it'll look pretty lame if you see a disclaimer
15,01        for a board that isn't yours on your board.  just leave the [m0!]
15,01        sig and transmission's name in there somewhere.
