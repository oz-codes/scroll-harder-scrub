15,01Wandering into the darkness
15,01The smell of blood all around you
15,01A knife in your hand
15,01Not a movement around you
15,01Sirens lighting up your mind
15,01Men all around you
15,01Cuffs on your hands
15,01Blood dripping from your torn wrists
15,01Your mind has gone blank
15,01All your dreams have just sank
15,01Your life spinning around you
15,01Thoughts of your former self
15,01No idea of your identity
15,01For you are being passed on to the land of
15,01.... Amnesia .....

15,01Poetry by Time Killer [Revolt]
