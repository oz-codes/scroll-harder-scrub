15,01i sit here again
15,01hands perched above the keyboard
15,01the label of the Tom Waits album spinning
15,01on the record player
15,01wow

15,01i don't know why i do this to myself
15,01or even how
15,01but i send myself into a session of deep thought

15,01fear enters my mind once again

15,01weird

15,01just confused
15,01and scared of myself

15,01what a strange person i am...
15,01We don't need no education
15,01the more i 'connect' with people who are just like me
15,01the more i realize i am one of a kind
15,01possibly
15,01that could be a good thing
15,01but i doubt it

15,01the glow of a monitor
15,01will never be a substitute
15,01for a pair of ears, and a set of vocal cords

15,01you just can't get the response you desire
15,01from an emotionless machine

15,01how
15,01explain
15,01expliquez vous
15,01how are you able to choose what's right for you
15,01the path of your life
15,01so much is expected out of people who haven't experienced 'the real world'
15,01what protected lives we live

15,01maybe i'm just stuck
15,01with nothing to do
15,01except to pose thesquestions
15,01and make you question yourself
