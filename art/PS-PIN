15,01Oh, my beautiful pin,
15,01How long i have waited for the time,
15,01The right time,
15,01My courage arises, 
15,01I long for you,
15,01Come closer pin,
15,01Let me feel your lovely bite,
15,01I stare at your point,
15,01Ready for the final step,
15,01Come closer pin,
15,01They say you must go right in the black part,
15,01That it won't hurt there,
15,01But I want your hurt,
15,01The pain makes my love grow,
15,01Quick pin,
15,01They are coming,
15,01The act must be done,
15,01Before they can stop us,
15,01Afterwards,
15,01There will be no stopping us,
15,01Yea,
15,01Afterwards we'll go down to McDonalds,
15,01With the carbine,
15,01There will be no stopping us,
15,01Quick pin,
15,01Hurry the time draws near,
15,01Just a little closer pin,
15,01Right into the black part,
15,01Closer,
15,01Closer,
15,01Closer,
15,01AAAHH!! FUCK, THE PAIN, Make it stop PIN, MAKE IT STOP!!
