12,01D11ear Mom,
15,01         11Welp, after a Wig release, 1000 flames, and disco.. here is the Futil10e
12,01p11acket.  Omot and I have been put'n Futile on our ansis, so I figured I'd just
12,01p11ut in some junk about where we all got started from.

15,01         11It all started when I had sex with ostscout's mother.  Out pooped
12,01O11stscout.... Ooops.. wrong story.

15,01         11It all started when I was actually publishing my lit.  Echo, Totemo,
12,01a11nd I were all together in a group called PaGE (People and Gods Endowed) that
12,01w11as a lit-only group.  Welp, the lit scene started to grow right after we were
12,01f11ormed, and the scene was flooded with insane-wannabe poetry.  Echo decided to
12,01p11ack up his lit bags.  I lose contact with Totemo. That Leaves me.  On the oth10e11r
12,01s11ide we have TUBE.  Run by the ever-famous Omot.  His group, much like mine,
12,01h11ad only one working member.. Him.  So, I talked to him on the phone, and we
12,01d11ecided to be elite and merge.  After a few names.. Boom.. FUTiLE is born.  Ok10,
12,01s11o all the people who thought they were in TUBE come into FUTiLE, and Omot and 10I
12,01t11ell them they either do some shit, or boom.  I think thats about that same ti10me
12,01t11he group quickly grew to 2 members.  Omot and I.  I decided that the lit scen10e
12,01w11as a peice of dog shit, 2-3 groups were pumping out decent lit.  The rest was
12,01c11rap.  I had worked on Ansi before, and gotten good at it, just never really
12,01f11ollowed it up because of lack of time.  I was a Hack/Phreack person, along wi10th
12,01a 11lit person.  I couldn't just say "Hey, lets do ansi also!", I'd produce the
12,01s11ame shit that was goin' out in the lit scene if I tried publish all 3.  So I
12,01s11tarted doing ansi.  Omot was producing some dope ass shiznit artwork, and aft10er
12,01a 11while, I was doing the same.  FUTiLE was put on all our ansis.  I applied to
12,01R11ELiC, didn't get accepted.  So I stuck around.  Here I am, doing ansi for one
12,01o11f the most prestigous groups in the country.  Two members, now THAT is presti10-
12,01g11ous.  After RELiC didn't accept me, I realized that I still had alot of work
12,01t11o be done before I could truly be an ansi god.  Unfortunately, I'm lazy.  So
12,01I11'm an ansi peasent.  Thats alright, cuz if you compare me to the rest of the
12,0161114 people, I am Zeus, sitting on Mount Eliteness, ruling over all the other
12,01g11ods.

15,01         11Really Though, work'n w/ a 2 man group is really nice.  Very relaxed.
12,01A 11little competitive.  You don't have to worry about 'group communication', ju10st
12,01p11ost your newest works on Inner Tube (The remaining ashes of TUBE, FUTiLE WHQ)10,
12,01a11nd then go about your business.  Gave me a chance to learn from Omot's
12,01m11istakes, and masterpeices.  No bullshit, no apps, no sites, no members, no
12,01p11acks, and no feuds between members.  So WTF are we missing?  We've got the
12,01e11lite name, the talented artists, the neato WHQ, and the elite FILE_ID.DIZ!
12,01T11his is how all groups should be run!

12,01-----11G12reet11z12------
12,01O11mot:  10F11UTiLE will never die.
12,01H11.P. Hovercraft: 10Y11o' G money, I've worn that saying out.
12,01E11cho:  10I 11am god, bow in my presence.
12,01G11reepFreek:  10S11tick around, maybe some day we will have three members.
12,01/11+CiD, iCE, TRiBE, CiA, NATiON, UNiON, and all the other groups w/ a small
11,01i in their name:
10,01N11o, we will not be assimilated, resistance is futile.  Leave me alone.  No, you
11,01can not join FUTiLE.  Omot and I will rule the world before you guys die.
12,01V11ooDoo Child, ASYLUM, BLADE, and Psychosis (Sorry, but VooDoo is elite..):
10,01U11h.. Hi.  Keep the lit come'n out.  I may not be around to show ya'll how its
11,01done, but I feel for ya'll.  You take alot of shit from people like me.

15,01        12H11ello world.  It's me, Omot, co/founder of that one art group, Futil10e
12,01o11r something.  I guess, you've already heard Whodini's side of the story, so
12,01I 11won't bore you with mine :)
15,01        11We're just your average ol' two-man local Acid-quality [Hehe] group.
12,01W11hich reminds me, if you actually want to join [How'd that happen?], then yo10u
12,01c11an either find either of us or wait until the next pack [if there's a next]
12,01a11nd utilize our sure-to-be-groovy app, which couldn't be coded in time for
12,01t11his release [Hey, assembly isn't really known for fast coding].  Sure, we
12,01s11uck, but don't take *my* word for it, look at the rest of the damn pack :)
15,01        11"If you've never heard of us, you aren't as /<-r4|> as you thought."
12,01E11ither that, or you don't live in 614/C'lumbus or listen to our faint pleas
12,01f11or acceptance.
15,01        11The reason is... I dunno.  We're just a real laid-back [meaning we'l10l
12,01l11ay just about anyone] group, out to have a little fun.  I know Acid and Ice
12,01a11re trembling in fear as the era of the Futile revolution dawns and that's w10h00y
12,01w11e purposely make our ansis not look so good :)
15,01        11All groups should be like this, absolutely no deadlines whatsoever a10t
12,01a11ll [This is our first release since we started putting "Futile" at the end
