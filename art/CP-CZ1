15,01                                 Chapter 1

15,01                                                    
15,01        Cothzin ran and leaped with all his might, feeling the blazing sting 
15,01of a fireball graze his leg.  He rolled down the grassy hill and looked for 
15,01cover.  He found it in a small hollow on the side of the hill he had just 
15,01rolled down.  He climbed in and waited for the inevitable.

15,01        "COTHZIN! Emerge WITH the Scarab or face the concequences!" yelled 
15,01Katovorkh.

15,01        "And allow it into the possession of one so vile as yourself?  I would 
15,01not ask such sacrifices were I you.  It shall never be yours!  Were I forced 
15,01to choose between my death and the scarab falling into your hands I should 
15,01choose the former, for I know what you would use your power for, and I cannot 
15,01allow that,"  answered Cothzin.        

15,01        "Then you would die to prevent my use of the Scarab?  I am afraid you 
15,01cannot stop me from getting the Scarab, but your request for death is one I 
15,01will honor with pleasure.  You have chosen to die, and die you will, Cothzin!" 

15,01        With that Cothzin realized the full measure of Katovorkh's hate; he 
15,01would stop at nothing for the power that ate away at him from his bones to his 
15,01flesh, indeed, his very heart.  He realized he was going to die, and if he did 
15,01not act quickly, it was likely that his entire land would be destroyed along 
15,01with him.  He had to get rid of the Scarab somewhere.  Knowing he was as good 
15,01as dead, he concentrated for a minute and the familiar yellow glow sprang 
15,01fourth from the deepest depths of his mind, and then following it, the Sign 
15,01that he had reached the state he needed to cast his enchantments.  He knew 
15,01the sorcery he needed;  He knew it was within his power to cast it; He simply 
15,01did not know if he could bring himself to cast it, to destroy himself, even at 
15,01the risk of losing everything he held dear if he did not.  He broke through 
15,01the yellow, and was facing himself.  He saw Katovorkh outside, readying his 
15,01hateful magick to destroy him.  He saw his family at home, not knowing where 
15,01he was or the danger and impeding destruction he faced.  He suddenly knew, not 
15,01in his mind, but in his heart, that they had to live, that he must die so that 
15,01so many could live.  But he knew not if he had the time to save them.  He ripped
15,01 
15,01a hole in the very air surroundings and climbed through.  He saw much, and 
15,01understood nothing.  He took a piece of that reality and wrapped it around the 
15,01Scarab and heaved it into the hollow.  He then returned to reality and went to 
15,01face Katovorkh outside.  

15,01        "Come and get it, Katovorkh, its all yours," He said with a smile.

15,01        Katovorkh was worried.  He  wanted the Scarab, but this worried him.  
15,01Why would Cothzin give it up?  The answer was obvious to him;  He had not. 

15,01        "What have you done with the Scarab, imbicile!"  screamed Katovorkh.

15,01        "I have put it in a place that you should easily find it. Right over 
15,01there in the cave.  I will lead you to it if you desire,"  Cothzin said with a 
15,01carefully false cheerfulness, turning towards the cave.  

15,01        Katovorkh didn't like something about this,  he had not thought of 
15,01Cothzin as such an easy win.   However, he  was not one to mistrust good 
15,01fortune, and this certainly was good fortune.  "Fine then, lead the way."

15,01        Cothzin brought him to the cave and pointed to the Scarab. Katovorkh 
15,01grabbed for it and felt a strange sensation;  His body filled with energy, 
15,01and felt near to the point bursting.  His heart filled with power and his 
15,01life-blood ran and bursted from his flesh.  His hair stood on end with the 
15,01vast power it felt and his eyes and stomach churned.   His flesh blackened, 
15,01his hands curled into black shivering balls of burning flesh and it was over. 

15,01        "I won.  I WON!" exclaimed Cothzin breathlessly, not realizing the 
15,01cave's natural unstability.  The power of what had recently flowed through it 
15,01had weakened the already nearly collapsing walls and ceiling, and it started 
15,01to fall in upon him.  There was not even time enough to think;  it started 
15,01with a rock falling upon his head and knocking him unconcious,  and then it 
15,01finished him off with the power of a tidal wave.
