15,01the line twixt wake and sleep is blurred

15,01waking up to memories of a war
15,01  with the monsters of my sleepytime   
15,01    heaven
15,01clouds fluffy rabbits bouncing
15,01      cross the sky
15,01 you're the cutest psychopomps i ever saw

15,01o mother mother mother
15,01    o it hurts more
15,01  now the vultures are all gone
15,01feathers cushioning the lashes
15,01   mother don't you cry
15,01o it hurts more when you cry

15,01    crawling over desert beds
15,01 fall into craters hands punched through
15,01the barren sheets
15,01       awake to vaguest memories
15,01   of thrashing running falling screaming
15,01             no no no
15,01you won't take me away
15,01  you can't take me away
15,01    you won't take me away from this

15,01 fingernails begin to bleed
15,01   i'm holding on
15,01    hanging on hanging on
15,01 to mr doesn't care

15,01      let me tell you 'bout the difference
15,01between monsters and the nightmares
15,01   these are demons
15,01      i can show you the scars
15,01 just look into my eyes
15,01as long as you don't fall into the pool
15,01    i'm not fishing you out of this one girl

15,01 holding on holding on holding on
15,01            no no no
15,01just let go just let go 
15,01  nobody will see
15,01just let go just let go
15,01  nobody will see
15,01       there's no one here to watch you
15,01    mother's gone away
15,01 there's no one here to judge you
15,01the birds are here to stay.
