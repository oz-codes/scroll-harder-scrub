15,01|   What is TSR Pop-Key?:TSR Pop-Key was created to store macro's that you type|

15,01| and then put them into the key-board buffer as if you typed them yourself,   |

15,01| leaving you more time to do other things. Put handles, passwords, phone #'s, |

15,01| etc... anything you allways will be typing over and over again.              |
