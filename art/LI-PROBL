15,01You think you know what's wrong with me?

15,01What's troubling me?

15,01Nope.

15,01I'm twelve steps ahead of you.  I solved those problems a month ago.  Shit, if
15,01I hadn't, I'd drown.

15,01You have to be able to keep up, man.  The world moves fast.  You really have to
15,01know what you can afford to carry with you, what you should drop and watch fade
15,01away, and what you should pick up as you whiz by...

15,01I don't want any help with my problems anyway.  Sometimes I think I do, but in
15,01the end, I always like my solutions the best.

15,01So where can I get a bag of alfredo sauce at this time of night?
