15,01" See, I think drugs have done some good things for us.
15,01  I really do and if you don't believe drugs have done good things for us,
15,01  do me a favour. Go home tonight and take all your albums, all your tapes,
15,01  all your CDs and burn 'em. 'Cos you know what? All the muicians who've made
15,01  all that great music that's enhanced your lives throughout the years...
15,01  Rrreal fucking high on drugs... "


15,01Dreaming of that face again.
15,01It's bright and blue, and shimmering.
15,01Grinning wide, and comforting me with it's three warm and wild eyes...

15,01On my back, and tumbling.
15,01Down that hole, and back again.
15,01Rising up
15,01And wiping the webs and the dew from my withered eye...

15,01in, out, in, out, in out


15,01                       A child's rhyme stuck in my head.
15,01                       It said that life is but a dream,
15,01                       I've spent so many years in question
15,01                       To find I've known the answer all along.  
15,01                         

15,01So good to see you...
15,01I've missed you so much...
15,01So glad it's over...
15,01I've missed you so much...
15,01Came out to watch you play,
15,01Why you running?


15,01                       Shrouding all the ground above me.
15,01                       Is this holy crow above me.
15,01                       Black as holes within a memory
15,01                       And blue as our new second sun.
15,01                       I stick my hand into his shadow
15,01                       To pull the pieces from the sand
15,01                       Which I attempt to reassemble
15,01                       To see just who I might have been.
15,01                       I do not recognise the vessel,
15,01                       but the eyes seem so familiar
15,01                       like phosphorescent desert buttons
15,01                       Singing one, familiar, song.
15,01                        

15,01So good to see you,
15,01I've missed you so much...
15,01So glad it's over...
15,01I've missed you so much.
15,01Came out to watch you play.
15,01Why you running away?
15,01Came out to watch you play...
15,01Why you running...?


15,01                       prying open my third eye...


15,01So good to see you once again
15,01I thought that you were hiding
15,01You thought that I had run away
15,01Chasing the tail of dogma
15,01I opened my eye and there we were...

15,01So good to see you once again
15,01I thought you were hiding from me
15,01And you thought that I had run away...
15,01Chasing a trail of smoke and reason...


15,01                       prying open my third eye...
