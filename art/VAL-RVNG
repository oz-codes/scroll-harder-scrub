15,01Revenge     
15,01by valgamon@dfw.net (CiA)

15,01     "BLAM!"
15,01     My gripping fist shook with the recoil. A spurting spew
15,01of thick, copious blood shot forth from the forehead of David
15,01Edwards. He was the first one. But at this point, I really
15,01didn't care. Nothing was going to stop me from achieving my
15,01goal. I had waited seven years to extract my revenge.
15,01     I walked, calm and collected, down the dimly-lit
15,01hallway, keeping a perfectly synchronous pace. Left, right,
15,01left, right... never wavering. My muffled footsteps echoed in
15,01the cavernous halls.
15,01     A door opened in front of me. Mrs. Hinkson dropped the
15,01stack of papers she was carrying and screamed upon seeing my
15,01red-spattered visage. However, before she could finish her
15,01wailing alarm, a bullet tore through her neck and lodged
15,01itself just beyond her trachea, in her upper spine. She
15,01flopped onto the floor awkwardly, as if she were a fish out
15,01of water. After a few quick, jerking spasms, she lay still.
15,01     Left, right, left, right...
15,01     My mouth began to curl into a tight, wicked grin. I
15,01wondered who the next poor soul to cross my path would be.
15,01     A short, stocky, greasy-faced scrub who I immediately
15,01recognized as Bernie Jackson rounded a distant corner. I
15,01stopped walking and raised my arm to my level of vision.
15,01     The sudden silence caused by the absence of my
15,01footsteps caught me off guard, and I missed my mark. A
15,01piercing cry of agony resonated throughout the hall as the
15,01first shot shredded its way into Bernie's shoulder, with such
15,01force as to pin him to the wall. "No!" he cried as I adjusted
15,01the crosshairs. "No! Don't!" His feeble pleas fell on deaf
15,01ears as a second bullet shattered his skull, sending bone
15,01fragments and chunks of bloodied brain shrapnel flying in all
15,01directions.
15,01     I let out a barely-audible sigh of relief at the fact
15,01that class was still in session, and the soundproof rooms
15,01would not betray my mission.
15,01     Left, right, left, right... the tension left my body as
15,01the comforting sound of my footsteps returned. I went
15,01downstairs. Someone would notice soon.
15,01     As I turned another corner, I noticed two giggling girls
15,01chattering about some bullshit. I've always hated the sound
15,01of fake, shallow laughter. It scraped at my eardrums like
15,01razor-sharp nails on a chalkboard. Without thinking, or
15,01aiming, I let three buckshots loose down the hall. With each
15,01explosive crack, the aroma of gunsmoke grew thicker in my
15,01nostrils. I watched the first two cleave the skinny girl's
15,01leg. She howled in horror as the third tore its way into her
15,01friend's ribcage, showering her in a wall of blood. Before
15,01the fat girl even had a chance to realize what had happened,
15,01she fell to the cold, tiled floor, dead. The skinny girl had
15,01just enough time to make eye contact with me before a bullet
15,01ripped into the center of her chest. She spit up blood all
15,01over herself as she drew her last breath. Such a mess. I
15,01deviated from my original course, cutting through a small
15,01courtyard to reach my ultimate destination.
15,01     As I opened the door to the boys' locker room, the bell
15,01rang. I covered the gun with the open flaps of my jacket. A
15,01rushing herd of impatient teenagers pushed forward, surging
15,01as one great mass, unaware of the carnage that awaited them
15,01just a few hundred feet away. But that didn't matter. I knew
15,01what I had to do.
15,01     Billy Jacobs was still changing out of his gym uniform
15,01when I arrived. As he buttoned the last few buttons on his
15,01shirt, he looked up and saw me.
15,01     "My God, Jake... what happened?!" His jaw dropped as he
15,01took in the sight of me. I quickly glanced in the mirror
15,01above the sink. I was covered in blood. My hair was matted
15,01with it. My face was completely drenched. My clothes were
15,01red. It dripped from the end of my nose. It dripped from my
15,01earlobes. I could taste its bitterness on my tongue.
15,01     I withdrew the gun from its hiding place.
15,01     I watched as Billy Jacobs, the star quarterback of the
15,01football team, the most popular guy in the senior class, the
15,01last person in the school that anyone wanted to fuck with,
15,01turned white as a ghost. The color left his face in a split
15,01second, and his eyes grew wide. Seeing me covered in blood
15,01was the first stage of shock. Seeing the gun was the second.
15,01     I took advantage of his panicked state and grabbed him
