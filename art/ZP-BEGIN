15,01"Beautiful Beginnings"

15,01The beginning is always beautiful,
15,01Until all the facts are known.
15,01The start of anything is wonderful
15,01Until that moment.
15,01The moment
15,01When everything is seen,
15,01Seen clearly and in perspective.
15,01Then all becomes strange
15,01And incomprehensible.
15,01The only beauty then,
15,01Is waiting for the end.
