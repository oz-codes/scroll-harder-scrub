15,01                          Darkness Comes The Nyte

15,01Late, a feeling of despair
15,01lightning flashes, a grey-black light
15,01Somewhere, a cry fills the air
15,01Darkness comes the night
15,01Silence, moving, brings pain
15,01Blood red, twitching sky
15,01Forthcoming, smell the rain
15,01And in weakness close your eyes

15,01Look inside, farther in
15,01The creature comes, a deadly sight
15,01Invoking fear in the hearts of men
15,01Darkness comes the night
15,01Silence, moving, brings pain
15,01Blood red, twitching sky
15,01Forthcoming, smell the rain
15,01Run for your life

15,01Slip-sliding, run fast
15,01Surrounded, closed off tight
15,01Thunder crashing, smashing, evil blast
15,01Darkness comes the night
15,01Silence, moving, brings pain
15,01Blood red, twitching sky
15,01Forthcoming, smell the rain
15,01Know that you must die

15,01Bloodstained hands, look down upon them
15,01The blood of the innocent all around you
15,01Burn what you cannot understand, hate what you fear
15,01A past of murder, in the name of god
15,01Dont die for my sake
15,01Your salvation is near
15,01Nail me up, kill me for you
15,01I'll come back in a day or two
15,01Spit on me, whip me so
15,01Then cry when I have to go
15,01Judge me, then ask for forgiveness
15,01For I have taught you this
15,01Meet my father, kneel before yourself
15,01Put me on a shelf


15,01The day has come, you stand before me
15,01Beaten though I am, I love you still
15,01Checking your name, see if you have fallen astray
15,01No light Comes, no more day


15,01Darkness comes the night
15,01Silence, moving, brings pain
15,01Blood red, twitching sky
15,01Forthcoming, smell the rain
15,01And in weakness close your eyes....

15,01    Note:For Those of you who read this in the way I wrote it,
15,01    and can decypher this cryptic message, it must be stated
15,01    that this is not a message of hate, nor a message of anger,
15,01    only a statment of the facts through my clouded, failing
15,01    vision...
