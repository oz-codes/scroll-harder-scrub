13,01*  Okay, here it is plain and simple.  The pack is late because _I_, Tron
13,01   caused it to be late.  I was the one that gathered all the data on all
13,01   our new members, boards, and boards for the net, therefore, _I_ was the
13,01   only one capable of compiling all of that info for the pack.  I mean,
13,01   hell, when you do as much as I do >SMACK<  (attitude adjustment performed
13,01   by image)...Okay, even though that snazzy little .DIZ caught your attention
13,01   truth is, we make our member and site lists based upon the Senior Staff
13,01   phone number list (which we guard like the Rebellion, against the evil
13,01   DaRK Empire, who's always dying to get their hands on it), and since I'm
13,01   the one that compiles that baby, the other staff members couldn't do
13,01   their jobs in making those.  So, instead of pissing off all of our new
13,01   members and sites, we decided to delay the pack.

06,01*  Speaking of which, a bunch of really cool members joined us this month!
06,01   The Narccissist and Maximum Overdose joined us from the dearly departed
06,01   Imperial.  Narc lends us his leadership abilities as our new Canadian
06,01   Coordinator, and the Max  brings us his awesome ansi talents. Glad to
06,01   have ya, guys!  Also, the guys from CAE decided to merge with us, and
06,01   that added a whole bunch of talent to our group.  CAE brought us Twitch,
06,01   Flashpoint, Psi-Stalker, Skitzo, and Vapor (former ACiD also) to our
06,01   ansi department, Dark Spyre beefs up our coding team, and Doomsday and
06,01   Screwworm bring their awesome music abilities to the group. Thrilled to
06,01   have you, dudes.  And also, The Fugitive (ansi), Mirage (courier), and
06,01   Dark Jester (coder) join us from Reactor!  Hey, fellas! And finally,
06,01   Psychoskyshark joins our Lit department. Wassup, man?!?!  Welcome all
06,01   new members! Looking forward to seeing your work in the coming months..

13,01*  Also, we've added Pestilence's board, Point of No Return, as our Canadian
13,01   Headquarters.  We asked for a CHQ that gave a shit about OUR group, and
13,01   we couldn't have asked for a better board!  Thanks, Pestilence!

06,01*  In an effort to keep tardy, unorganized packs from happening again, I am
06,01   stepping down from some of my duties in CiA, and handing over the World
06,01   Headquarters position to Trident's board, Brave New World.  My job and
06,01   the rest of my life are making it tough on me to continue as WHQ, and I
06,01   am quite sure Trident will do a much better job than I am capable of
06,01   doing at the moment.

13,01*  This month, we've also decided to add a new feature to our packs, that
13,01   we're calling CAB.  CAB, Creators of intense Art Biographies, will be a
13,01   personal look at the lives of each of the members that make up our group.
13,01   Each month, we'll have a few of our members fill out a little questionaire
13,01   detailing their lives and motivations.  If you'd like to see a specific
13,01   question added to CAB, drop us a line.

06,01*  In Crime in Progress Net news, a whole hell of a lot of boards applied
06,01   to the net, this month, and due to the overwhelming response, many were
06,01   added without notice.  If you see yourself in the nodelist, you already
06,01   have mail being held on Illegal Embassy, join us!  And as usual, if
06,01   you'd like to join the net, fill out the net packet enclosed in this pack.
06,01   Some great boards have joined the net, and MANY groups are being represented
06,01   by the users there. It is VERY active and sure to catch your interest.

13,01*  And lastly, I'd like to apologize to everyone that I personally have
13,01   ignorned, forgotten about, or otherwise might have pissed off this month.
13,01   You can imagine if the pack is this damn late, I must have done more to
13,01   everyone else that you.  If this applies to you, please remind me what I
13,01   was suppossed to do or reply about.  As Maestro is fond of saying, there
13,01   is more to this than just the scene, lives do exsist, and mine got in the
13,01   way this month.
