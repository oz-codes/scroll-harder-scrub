15,01                                 Pylons

15,01        Up in unseen clouds tinged with pink, lavender, the asure air, the 
15,01pylons stood.  Proud they, erected sikhara towers of brass which stood as
15,01the summits of a great monument over the land of elephants.  Those that 
15,01dwelled here, some physically, others often, took these great 
15,01heaven-sundering monuments for granted.  No accident, this, for opulent ones
15,01party to the tower's pleasures didn't often consider what escaped their
15,01fleeting grasp.  No mistake, then, that the events ready to take shape at 
15,01these pylons were completely hidden of the tower's occupants.  To those 
15,01outside, moans of the bottom castes and unchaste (untouchables) accompanied
15,01by brassy, thundering roars of herded slave elephants resounded throughout
15,01the muddy deltas, even unto Punjab.  After the initial shockwave and rising
15,01up the yells caused, an echo hung still in the air, spurning oblivion.  The 
15,01call, the echo, was fading of late, but wise ones, fakirs, knew the renewal
15,01of the cycle was close at hand.  In the towers, fools of fakirs, fallacies, 
15,01concluded all was well as they gorged in all mundane ways to excess.  The 
15,01wise fakirs, smiling the wan smile of the oppressed but expectant, would do
15,01nothing but wait.  Dark rolling clouds spread as sepia ink quenched in a 
15,01river above the sikhara towers, and ozone with sheared copper (blood) hung
15,01heavily inside, waiting as a fakir.

15,01        The All-American calmly strode accross the steaming asphalt.  He
15,01carried himself as a king among beggars, striding curtly in his buff-glowed
15,01shoes of fresh sewn leather.  The lower-class sections of Manhattan never
15,01phased him.  Afterall, didn't selective reality take care of everything?  
15,01Just a gleaming hallway to a feast in the Taj Mahal.  Gleaming like newly 
15,01capped teeth, he thought, considering his own beauties.  He smiled 
15,01internally, smugly.  He trod, standing ever straight, over to the procession
15,01of flat, uncaring faces proceeding along the broken concrete.  The liquid, 
15,01nullifying scent of spent gasoline slapped his nostrils.  Simultaneously, a
15,01cola can crumpled under his left foot and refused to dislodge itself.
15,01He considered this and tried to return to his other reality, but failed.
15,01He gasped under his breath in annoyance, facing the ground reality.  He 
15,01speared his way over to a curb, limping somewhat, but trying hard to exude 
15,01the aura of dignity.  He balanced himself on his right leg, a tanned, 
15,01All-American crane befeathered with the finest Italian business (power) 
15,01suits one could buy in all of New York.  Stuck real good, he mused, gripping
15,01the crumpled aluminum tightly.  The All-American's tanned, big hands made 
15,01short work of the can's desire to stay, but a much more considerable offense
15,01was then apparent.  As the crumpled metal leech played out its sorry 
15,01trajectory out onto the dirty asphalt, a pink lifeline, gummed with earth and
15,01concrete, followed and stretched itself thread-thin.  The All-American looked 
15,01on uncomprehendingly, and then he focused in, with furrowed brow and 
15,01unswerving blue eyes registering shock.  A blob of hot pink bubble gum 
15,01adhered to his smooth, pristine rubber sole, like a bloated, dumb birthmark
15,01on the otherwise perfect face of the All-American girl next door.  Such 
15,01incredible, irrational hate and destructive anguish filled him to the core
15,01then!  His handsome face became a pink, strained devil-mask, as his huge 
15,01hands coiled into tight boxes of annihilation, and a feral, primordial yell 
15,01ripped his mouth and throat.  Spittle shot all over his handmade silk tie, 
15,01and also onto the cheek and jowl of an inattentive passer-by.  His rolling,
15,01blurred vision roamed all over the appearance of the passer-by, a Foreigner
15,01with dumb, black eyes, dirty rat-brown skin, and clothes which were much like
15,01spotty, moth-eaten brown bags.  He stopped and stared, wired up and snarling.
15,01It was all the Foreigner could do to retreat, still not fully aware of what
15,01was happening.  A subdued, ignorant stare marred the Foreigner's features, 
15,01but what set the All-American into motion was the protruding, caramel-tinged
15,01buck teeth, glistening at him to complete the Foreigner's infuriating 
15,01impression.  He swung then, a graceless maneuver which most resembled a 
15,01haymaker punch, but was really meant to scare the Foreigner and get him out
15,01of the way, he convinced himself in the rational core of his thoughts.  
15,01Instead of frightening, it rather forced the passer-by backwards and outwards
15,01while violently birthing three detestable teeth and cracking the straight 
15,01cartilage of the Foreigner's squat nose.  The All-American's carefully 
15,01bulked and sculpted musculature swung to a halt, and a crumpled animal 
15,01skidded to a halt on the broken ground, a bubbling, viscid mixture of thick
15,01mucus mingled with thin, runny blood made a lifeline to the All-American's
15,01all-gold varsity ring.  A pink river ran.  Suddenly, the All-Amreican noticed
15,01the large, judicial gang of strangers, a few sympathizers, most merely 
15,01onlookers, which had just observed all of the recent events.  Oh God, Oh God,
15,01he chanted.  Oh my God!  I didn't mean it, he pleaded.  I never mean it!
15,01Oh god.  Alone, an old, wrinkled shell of a man wearing a red bandanna and a 
15,01much-too-small demim jacket locked on a soft gaze with the All-American, and 
15,01gave the slightest of nods.  Of course, the All-American started, I 
15,01understand.  His big, tanned hands searched out his carefully crafted woolen
15,01pocket and removed a fine, burnished and very familiar eelskin billfold.  It
15,01only contained denominations of one hundred or more, but he wanted so very
15,01much to fix what had happened.  Planning on having a relaxing week off at 
15,01Waldorf-Astoria with this, but what do you know, you've got to take
