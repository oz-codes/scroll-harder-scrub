15,01The End

15,01Knowledge is the food to the hungry,
15,01Without it, they shall shall surely starve.
15,01They will wither away into nothingness.
15,01No longer are people satisfied with but a taste,
15,01they want to know it all, this shall be their downfall.

15,01In the end, everthing shall be revealed,
15,01no secrets shall be withheld from the eye.
15,01the good will be shown, the bad will expelled,
15,01questions asked for eons shall be sent from
15,01the back of the brain to receive explination.

15,01No longer will there be wondering,
15,01why, when, or where will be irrelevant.
15,01You will see that there is nothing more,
15,01then a large cell... waiting for you...
15,01at the end of the hall.
