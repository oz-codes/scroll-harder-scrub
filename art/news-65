15,01        This past year has introduced several changes in the art and music""""
15,01  scenes, and we've had our share of internal changes and challenges withinCiD
15,01  the group.  Unfortunately, In Tense (a.k.a. Sonic), Rexazy, and Sikos are
15,01  no longer in pHluid.  But, due to the efforts of the currect active
15,01  members we are back on schedule and have been releasing monthly music-------
15,01  packs since November 1997 on Hornet (http://www.hornet.org).  Two other1998
15,01  major changes have taken place recently.------------------------------------

15,01        First in the news is that I have assumed the responsibility of
15,01  coordinating these monthly packs.  Pinion, the former coordinator, has
15,01  become consumed with too much work for the time being.  However, he still
15,01  remains an active member in the group.

15,01  reconstructing the pHluid website and the results are a clean,
15,01  well-designed set of pages.  He will be the webmaster for this site and the
15,01  has all the current information on it.  Look for its public unveiling on 
15,01  March 1, 1998!  Applications to pHluid are encouraged.  We are a dynamicsion
15,01  group that does not have a single style but demands high quality from its
