15,01                   10There is a hard & noble patience
15,01                   10I admire in my friends who are dead
15,01                   10Though I admit there are none of them
15,01                   10I would change places with

15,01                   10For one thing look how poorly they dress

15,01                   10Only one is still beautiful
15,01                   10& that is because
15,01                   10She chose to drown herself in a Swiss lake
15,01                   10Fed by a glacier said in local myth
15,01                   10To be a pool of the gods

15,01                   10& when her body was found she was so
15,01                   10Preserved by the icy currents
15,01                   10That even her eyelashes seemed to quiver
15,01                   10Beneath my breath

15,01                   10Though that was only for an instant

15,01                   10Before she was strapped to a canvas stretcher
15,01                   10& loaded into a blue van
15,01                   10Soon I was the only person still standing
15,01                   10At the lake's edge   A man made lonely
15,01                   10By such beauty

15,01                   10A man with less than perfect faith in any god
