15,011. Well first off, we need  to announce some changes around  the office.   Spot
15,01   and iCE have gone seperate  ways.  Root88 was  promoted to Senior Staff, and
15,01   Mass Delusion took a bow (maybe not his final one, but only time will tell).
15,01   That leaves Slothy and Root88 as iCE's new Senior Staff pair.   We certainly
15,01   wish Spot a lot of luck and will miss him.

15,012. We have to apologize for the  downtime of Digital Art Core.   The problem is
15,01   domain-related,  so we'll get it back online when we finally get the 3-count
15,01   against NSI.

15,013. Upon hearing the news,  Root88 waxed his  bikini line and  shaved his  legs.
15,01   When people asked, "What does being Senior Staff of iCE have to do with body
15,01   hair removal?", Root88 simply said,  "You have no idea the  kind of tail you
15,01   get by telling women you're Senior Staff of the biggest digital art group in
15,01   the world."   Behind him,  Mynx was  seen nodding.   IceMan then  added, "Y0
15,01   D00dz!  G0t any cardz?  Can eye be IRCop?" and everyone seemed to agree that
15,01   the Teletubbies episode must be over.

15,014. I (Slothy) just wanted to take  this time to thanks  MassD for his years and
15,01   years of  service to iCE (since 1995!).   He certainly  deserves a  rest and
15,01   some time off to relax a bit.  Mass Delusion singlehandedly pulled the group
15,01   through some  rough times and  deserves a round  of applause and an  ld50 of
15,01   alcohol.   Mass Delusion will remain in the  group as an Inactive  Member of
15,01   iCE, and will still buy the lolipops when iCE goes bowling.

15,015. Root88 started  his dynasty,  err rule, err chance  to server his fellow iCE
15,01   members  by decreeing that  everyone must  tell him  that he is "sexy as all
15,01   hell".   When  fellow  members told  him that  Slothy is  really sexier,  he
15,01   demoted  them to  Couriers.   We are  sad to  announce that  Devastator  and
15,01   MrMister are both now Couriers.  But hey, it had to be done.

15,016. We're in quilt heaven this  month!  We finished 3  major quilts that had iCE
15,01   Members working on them.   First off, we have our  Lord of the Rings  quilt.
15,01   Then we have two "Spree" quilts  which are done just to  crank them out in a
15,01   night or two with a crowd of artists on irc (irc.ice.org #tiles).   We think
15,01   you'll enjoy them.

15,016a. Additionally, we need to  steer you all to the  Breed/Raster quilt that was 

15,01    completed this month.   Unfortunately, since it  was just Breed  and Raster
15,01    but no iCE members,  we can't  really put it  in our pack  (damn! :).   But
15,01    maybe we can do an  iCE/Raster/Breed joint  quilt in the  future?   But the
15,01    boys over at Breed and Raster did a really amazing job with this quilt, and
15,01    we just can't resist giving it some extra promotion.

15,01    The Breed/Raster quilt can be found at 
15,01    http://tiles.ice.org/index.php?quilt_id=29

15,017. You'll notice some changes in  our presentation this month.  Be sure to read
15,01   our interview  with Jamie McCarter  this month and TonchyZ's tutorial on his
15,01   Darth Maul  image from last month.   We'll continue to  expand the "pack" in
15,01   the future.

15,01Doorbells and Sleighbells and Warm Woolen Mittens,
15,01     Slothy and Root88
