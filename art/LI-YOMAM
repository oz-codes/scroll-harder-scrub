15,01  The sight of his fingernails burning brightly brought a tear to Billy's eye.
15,01Not tears of joy.  Tears of real and palpable pain.  Billy was a pretty stupid
15,01boy.

15,01  One day, Billy bugged his parents to buy him a slingshot.  Realizing that
15,01this would be too dangerous for their careless little offspring, they bought
15,01him a Mazda RX-7 instead.  Billy didn't like the colour so he threw it away.
15,01Now, if there's one thing I can't stand, it's an ungrateful little moron like
15,01Billy, so, as the author, it is my duty to kill him in the most brutal way.

15,01  But of course, he'll have to cause some mayhem first.

15,01  Regretting his disposal of the car, Billy bought himself a Ford F-350.  He
15,01got the money from selling magic dirt.  Now, the dirt wasn't really magic, but
15,01the people buying it didn't know that.  Neither did Billy, because he was such
15,01a retard.

15,01  Now Billy was ready to hit the road.  If you're wondering whether he was old
15,01enough to drive, he was.  Billy was 107 years old.  His dawas 80 and his mom
15,01was 6.  Billy was kind of inbred.

15,01  So, as Billy's diesel-burning road-chewing machine from hell took to the
15,01streets, Billy cheered wildly.

15,01  Billy's cheering was not appreciated in Bridgeview, and his neighbours asked
15,01him to keep it down as he was lowering the property values.

15,01  Billy, oh Billy, you dirt-selling, hamster-eating moron.  The song wailed out
15,01of his AM radio.  Billy loved country music.  Billy tried to turn up the radio,
15,01but instead, accidentally hit the auto-dismantler switch, which is located
15,01right next to the volume knob on all Ford vehicles.

15,01  Parts of Billy's truck flew all over the road.  Luckily, Billy managed to
15,01avoid hitting his own dismantler switch.  I'm sick of typing the name "Billy"
15,01so I'm changing the little bastard's name to Horace.

15,01  Horace now had no buttocks after scraping them all over the pavement.  To
15,01teach the pavement a lesson, he smashed it really hard with his teeth.  "I
15,01thure thowed HIM!" thaid Horathe triumphantly.

15,01  Thuddenly, Horathe found himthelf thurrounded by a huge gang of killer
15,01Jehova'th witnetheth.  They didn't jutht WITNESS Jehovah, they thook hith HAND
15,01dammit!

15,01  "We're going to kick your teeth in," thaid the firtht one.  True to hith
15,01word, he picked up all the broken teeth and kicked them back in Horathe'th
15,01mouf.

15,01  "THANKS!" shrieked Horace, at such an annoying volume that they all went
15,01deaf, including Horace.

15,01  "..." said the Jehova's witness, because no one could hear him.  After a
15,01while, they all learned a crude form of sign language involving maiming the
15,01other person in a variety of interesting ways.

15,01  "That will be $10,000," slapped the Jehova's witness.

15,01  "What?" bashed Horace.

15,01  "For the dental work," chainsawed the Jehova's witness, who suddenly became
15,01Jewish.

15,01  "Look, pal," slashed Horace, "I don't owe you a damn thing!"

15,01  Horace then set him on fire, which in their new language meant, "I am a
15,01peacock, you son of a bitch."

15,01  Horace's toes exploded.  Not all at once.  ne after the other.  They sounded
15,01like popcorn.

15,01  Horace got very upset at his toes and cut his ears off.  Then he flossed his
15,01newly replaced teeth with piano wire and used the same wire to cut off the
15,01circulation on his legs.  After a day, they turned gray and fell off.
15,01Actually, he fell off them.

15,01  His parents were very upset when they found out.  They killed themselves to
15,01teach him a lesson.  Since Horace was so inbred that he was actually his own
15,01father, this killed him too.

15,01  When his will was read out, it was discovered that he was in fact all of his
