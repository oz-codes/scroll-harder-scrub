15,01 -=> Quoting Harry Sheep to All <=-

15,01 Okay, finally....
15,01 here is the religious propaganda that harry sheep got from Brother Tom
15,01 the preacher guy at UBC.

15,01 tis a little booklet with pictures in it....the narrative is as
15,01 foolows: 
15,01 See Dick.
15,01 Dick is cool.
15,01 Dick is bad.
15,01 Dick gets drunk.
15,01 Dick does bad things with girls.
15,01 Dick says good boys are sissies.
15,01 Dick says, "There is no God"
15,01 Dick doesn't believe in hell.
15,01 Dick says, "If there is a hell, it will be a party."
15,01 See Dick curse God.
15,01 Dick is not afraid.
15,01 Oh, stupid Dick.
15,01 See Dick die.
15,01 Now Dick believes in God!
15,01 Now Dick is afraid!
15,01 See Dick in the fire.    <this accompanied by lovely little drawing of
15,01                           dick burning in hellfire>
15,01 Now Dick isn't cool or bad.
15,01 Hear Dick scream and cry.
15,01 Now Dick believes in hell.
15,01 Now Dick knows the party's over.
15,01 Oh stupid Dick.
15,01 You should have believed and obeyed God while you were living.
15,01 Too late for Dick!

15,01 See Jane.
15,01 Jane thinks she's a good girl.
15,01 Jane will only "do it" with boys she loves.
15,01 Jane would never "do it" on the first date.
15,01 Jane only "does it" with "protection".
15,01 Jane never drives drunk.
15,01 Jane has a friend drive when she gets 'wasted"
15,01 Jane thinks boys shouldn't stare and hoot when she wears her short
15,01 shorts and tight tee shirt.
15,01 Yet Jane says "i'm a christian"
15,01 Jane says "Jesus is my Saviour. I'm going to heaven."
15,01 Ask Jane if she sins.
15,01 She'll say "Yes! You can't stop.  If you just say you're sorry after
15,01 you've sinned, He'll forgive you, no matter what."
15,01 Oh stupid foolish Jane.           <here comes the plot twist..oooo>
15,01 Jane doesn't really love jesus.
15,01 Jane loves her sin.
15,01 jane believes her pastor's lie that no one can stop sinning.
15,01 See Jane die.
15,01 Now see jane with Jesus.  
15,01 Jesus is angry with Jane because she loved sin more than she loved Him. 
15,01 See Jane thrown into hell fire!
15,01 Hear jane scream and cry!
15,01 Oh stupid, foolish Jane!
15,01 You should have stopped sinning and loved Jesus!
15,01 Too late for Jane!

15,01 See Sally.
15,01 Sally is scared.  Why?
15,01 Sally "did it" with a boy she loved.
15,01 Sally knew it was a sin, but she did it anyway.
15,01 Sallty got high.
15,01 Sally got drunk.
15,01 Sally liked boys looking at her.
15,01 SAlly cheated on a test.
15,01 Sally lied to get out of trouble.
15,01 Sally knew Jesus hated these things, but did them anyway.
15,01 Oh wicked, sinful SAlly.
15,01 <now sally goes to church and repents etc, omitted>
15,01 See How happy Sally is!
15,01 Because she first became sad, sorry Sally, she is now happy holy
15,01 Sally. 
15,01 Don't be like stupid Dick or stupid foolish Jane, 
15,01 or you'll be thrown into hellfire!
15,01 Be like sad, sorry Sally so you can become like happy holy Sally and
15,01 live with God.
