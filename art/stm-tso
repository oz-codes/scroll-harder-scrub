15,01I ate General Gao's orange chicken or whatever that is called.  I want to
15,01know who General Gao was and why he was spending time cooking chicken
15,01and not fighting.  You know what would be cool: Col. Sanders vs.
15,01General Gao.  East vs. West in a chicken battle to end all chicken
15,01battles.  Not that there has ever been a chicken battle and I have to
15,01admit that I have no idea what it would mean, but the point is that it
15,01would be messy and greasy and possibly involve live chickens.
