15,01     (1)   A husband and his wife had a bitter quarrel 
15,01           on the day of their wedding anniversary.
15,01           The husband gave his wife a gift
15,01           - a tombstone, with the inscription : 
15,01            "Here lies my wife - cold as ever."
15,01           Later the furious wife bought a return present
15,01           - also a tombstone - on which the inscription read : 
15,01            "Here lies my husband - stiff at last."

15,01     (2)  At a silver wedding anniversary
15,01          the husband was standing in one corner looking very sad. 

15,01          "What's the matter?" asked his friend. 
15,01          "Well, a week after marriage,
15,01           I got fed up and wanted to kill my wife,
15,01           but my lawyer said that I would get 25 years.
15,01           Now I realise that today I would have been a free man."

15,01     (3)  A couple were in bed after celebrating
15,01          their golden anniversary.  The wife said, 

15,01           "Darling, embrace me the way you used to 
15,01            when we first got married."
15,01          He did.

15,01           "Now kiss me the way you used to......
15,01            Now darling bite me the way you used to....." 

15,01         At this point the husband got out of bed and the wife said, 

15,01          "Where are you going, dear?" 

15,01          "To get my teeth," the husband replied.

15,01     (4)  During their silver anniversary, 
15,01          a wife reminded her husband :

15,01           "Do you remember when you proposed to me,
15,01            I was so overwhelmed that I didn't talk for an hour?" 

15,01          The hubby replied :

15,01           "Yes, honey, that was the happiest hour of my life."

15,01     (5)  When a bachelor marries, his wife has three qualities 
15,01          - she is an economist in the kitchen,
15,01            an aristocrat in the living room 
15,01            and a devil in bed.

15,01          After a few years, sure enough the three qualities remain, 
15,01          but not in the same order
15,01          - she is an aristocrat in the kitchen, 
15,01            a devil in the living room
15,01            and an economist in bed.

15,01          the groom told the bride

15,01           "Darling, love is blind."
15,01           "Yes dear," replied the bride, 
15,01           "but the neighbours are not,
15,01            so please close the windows."
