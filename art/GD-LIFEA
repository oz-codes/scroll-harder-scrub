15,01life after life.

15,01i'm slipping into obscurity
15,01ancient travels i now see
15,01heavens angels sweet touch on me
15,01gods whispers only for me
15,01pressure lifted theyleave me be
15,01is this a dream of reality
15,01version of the truth only i see
15,01twisted as an old knotted tree

15,01description unconvincing
15,01memory slowly dwindling
15,01non-believers concentrating
15,01believers anticipating
15,01homers thought revealing
15,01stars are not worth seeing
15,01when we get to realizing
15,01angels they are teasing

15,01curious the way they tell
15,01of heaven and not of hell
15,01accuracy they demand
15,01pin-point like a sculptures hand
15,01unwavering yet quiet
15,01no denying only sacrificial diet
15,01maybe its a dream
15,01a subconscious devotion to the mainstream

15,01soul lives on after we pass away
15,01could we dream another day
15,01save our desire to be a living matyr
15,01sinking into the fire
15,01pleasant our final drean
15,01no tears in the hidden seam
15,01slowly drained she becomes insane
15,01and lifes just another pain

15,01fading away this pleasant day
15,01living proof of our earthly stay
15,01angles start to smile
15,01askig to stay just a little while
15,01kind generous soul i deem of me
15,01so heaven please save me
15,01is this a dream of reality
15,01wont someone prove it to me

15,01time is kind to those who unwind
15,01free they're suffering mind
15,01letting loose the antagonizing goose
15,01free from the gallows clenching noose
15,01to the sky the next days gaze
15,01thinking of lifes wicked maze
15,01only i know the truth
15,01no denying god has his wicked white booth

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
