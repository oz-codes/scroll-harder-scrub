15,01        Hello all.  This is Donut Hole and Vendetta, presenting you with yet
15,01another pack of FiRE.  Since last month, FiRE has made a quite a big jump.  We
15,01tripled the number of the members and the quality/quantity of our pack, and
15,01needless to say, all of us have some potential.         
15,01        
15,01        Because its summer time, most of us have been on vacations, and thus
15,01the delay of the pack.  Halaster, Epitaph, and Donut Hole have been going out 
15,01of town for days, right when the pack was supposed to be out! :)  Maybe when 
15,01summer ends, we'll be more organized, but then again, maybe not.

15,01        If you haven't noticed in the member listings, Vagrant was kicked out
15,01of FiRE for various reasons.  For one thing, he acted as if he was the head
15,01of FiRE, telling people what to do and what not to do.  I personally think
15,01he needs to set his ego straight.  Another reason why he was kicked out was
15,01cuz we decided to trash the text department.  No one ever read them, and we
15,01thought they were a waste of time.

15,01        Oh, and don't forget to check out the mod by Shrapnel and the VGAs
15,01by Sir Freaksalot.  The mod is great, and so are the VGAs.  Give some slack
15,01on Sir Freaks... he just started VGAs.  And if Epitaph finds a MID to MOD 
15,01converter, we'll have another fine musician.  Yippie!  

15,01Bake at 400* for 15 minutes.  Stir, and enjoy.
