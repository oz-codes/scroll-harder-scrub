15,01                             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~


15,01   I'm sitting here with it in my hand,
15,01   wondering if I take it then where shall I land.
15,01   My friends have taken it before,
15,01   and they tell me that it opens a new door,
15,01   knowing me I'll probably pass out on the floor.
15,01   Still, I wonder, what will it do,
15,01   maybe it's like sniffing glue.
15,01   I know if I take it I could die,
15,01   but what the fuck, if my friends
15,01   can do it then so can I.
15,01   So I pop the sucker way, way back under my tongue,
15,01   making sure not to accidentally toss it into a lung.
15,01 
15,01   I wait, watching the clock,
15,01   I'm hyped now and ready to rock.
15,01   Times' going by so fucking slow,
15,01   I wonder what would happen if I pop 2 in a row?
15,01   So I pop another and begin to wait again,
15,01   hey I wonder what would happen if I pop ten?
15,01   Ah what the fuck, I'm good to go,
15,01   besides, it's still too damn slow!
15,01   Grabbing the rest of them, I fill my mouth,
15,01   if dreamland was money I'd be cookin in wealth!
15,01   
15,01   As I start thinking my friends are full of shit,
15,01   I stagger a little, get dizzy and have to sit.
15,01   Now I can see the room start to spin,
15,01   "It's working!" I think with a big grin.
15,01   I see lights and colours flashing by,
15,01   I feel like I'm Superman and can fly!
15,01   What a weird feeling, strange but nice,
15,01   and hey, there goes some purple mice.
15,01   Wait a minute, now that can't be true,
15,01   I've never seen purple mice, not even in a zoo!
15,01   "Ok relax," to myself I say,
15,01   "everything will be just ok."

15,01   I put my hands on my face and rub my eyes,
15,01   feeling my blood boiling and starting to rise.
15,01   After opening my eyes, I stared at the wall,
15,01   and just as it started to melt I got a phone call.
15,01   I jump to my feet as fast as I can,
15,01   and to the telephone I leaped and I ran.
15,01   "WHERE THE FUCK IS IT?!" I screamed,
15,01   everything in the house was a phone, or to me it seemed.
15,01   I started picking up things and sticking them in my ear,
15,01   "Oh Dear God! Did I leave the iron on?!" I bean to fear.

15,01   The phone stopped ringing, after a swift kick,
15,01   then room started spinning which made me sick.
15,01   I ran to the washroom and said hello
15,01   to the almighty white toilet bowl.
15,01   I barfed and barfed, I barfed a lot,
15,01   "Aw FUCK!" I said, "I got gut rot!"

15,01   I sat on the couch and it talked to me,
15,01   "Get off my face, I can't see!"
15,01   WOA! I'm fucked, what a trip
15,01   my brain's doing a back flip!
15,01   My drawers started to wiggle and flex,
15,01   "Oh man, I need some funky sex!"
15,01   So I grab my girl and fuck her slow,
15,01   or what that the dog?  I just don't know!
15,01   Yep, I'm pretty much fuked,
15,01   well at least the bitch sucked.

15,01   As I started to come down I got the chills,
15,01   so grabbed and downed a bottle of "Flinston" pills.
15,01   They didn't do much you see,
15,01   cuz I still felt the 'cid in me.
15,01   I was coming down; I was coming down mighty fast,
15,01   at least the hallucinations had past.

15,01   I stayed up all night, stoned out of my tree,
