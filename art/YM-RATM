15,01   02the bbser chewed his own empty piece of cheese as he stroked his melon
02,01 visceraly...he saw the bleeding monkey fly overheard on wings of blind jelly..
02,01the monkey bent down to face him and began to lick his eye....the bbser was sent
02,01into a violent icy shock as his tendons stood on end and turned to pasty goo....
02,01there was a toaster there...a salad shooter of the gods....a machine that would
02,01not be ignored or destroyed.......as the sweaty dirt-filled pile of boy realized
02,01the gods were angry he looked towards the sky and screamed in the agony of wet
02,01defeat...the cheese was gone, and soon, the scentless monkey would be too.......
02,01but the boy would yet get his frothy, saucy revenge on the corporations of death
02,01toys...he ate through the corporate rock bullshit with a sour frown smashed into
02,01his face....the taste was unpleasant, but so was the broken message he was burnt
02,01to convey to the world.........."rage against the machine", he thought as he bit
02,01another mouthful of the damned red tape that binds us all to the deadly, flaming
02,01chair that makes us all follow the rules and obey all the speed limits....a tear
02,01formed in the corner of the monkey's eye.......as he began to melt into the cold
02,01ground, he waved goodbye to the boy.......who would one day conquer the fascist
02,01 powers that killed him...the boy was renewed with a strong rush of adrenaline
02,01  that seemed to pulse through his turgid veins and howl into the wind.......
