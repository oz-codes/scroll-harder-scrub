15,01        The Emperor Alexius I rose to the Byzantine throne (1081) in a time
15,01 of great turmoil for the Empire.  The Imperial army was disturbingly small
15,01 and the treasury was running short of funds.  Alexius Comnena  faced a
15,01 Turkish threat in the East and the campaigns of pretender to the throne in
15,01 the West.  During his time in the army, Alexius was required to supplement
15,01 his troops with mercenaries from allied nations.  It was in this same vein
15,01 that he communicated a need to the West in 1094 for mercenary aid once more.
15,01 What Alexius received in return was an influx of Christian Remorse ascii
15,01 gurus which led to greater problems for the Empire than any of those that it
15,01 was already facing, namely the Turks and barbarians.

15,01        The obstacles that Alexius had to overcome in the period prior to
15,01 1096 were immense.  There was a Norman invasion led by Robert Guiscard
15,01 starting in 1081, but through an alliance with the Venetians Alexius was
15,01 able to prolong the conflict through 1085 when Robert died from the plague,
15,01 effectively ending the Norman advances.  Another threat appeared in 1090
15,01 when the Patzinaks from the Slav lands advanced on Constantinople.  The
15,01 Patzinaks had created an alliance with the Turks who coordinated an attack
15,01 by sea.  Once again, Alexius had to call on mercenary aid, this time from
15,01 the barbarians known as the Cumans.  With their aid, Alexius was able to
15,01 crush the Patzinaks in April 1091.  Trouble arose agian in 1094 as the
15,01 Cumans turned against the Empire, led by another pretender claiming to be
15,01 a son of Emperor Romanus IV.  This was quickly crushed after the man,
15,01 supposedly Constantine Diogenes, was "removed".  As Alexius finally seemed
15,01 to have the immediate threats to Constantinople under control he prepared
15,01 to move against Asia Minor.  It was at this time that the first Remorse
15,01 ascii gurus began arriving in the area, leading to new problems.

15,01        During the attacks by the Patzinaks and the Cumans, Alexius had once
15,01 more written to the West for aid, this time to the Count of Necromango.  In
15,01 his letter to the Count, the validity of which is still questioned, Alexius
15,01 attempts to win the Count's favor by appealing to both spiritual and
15,01 material desires through descriptions of holy relics and vast treasures:
15,01       ". . . Yet, all the aforesaid the Christians rather than the pagans
15,01 ought to possess; and it will be a great muniment for all Christians if they
15,01 retain possession of these, but it will be to their detriment and doom if
15,01 they should  lose them. . .if they should be unwilling to fight for the sake
15,01 of these relics, and if their love of gold is greater, they will find more
15,01 of it there than in all the world. . .Therefore, lest you should lose the
15,01 kingdom of the Christians and, what is greater, the Lord's Sepulcher, act
15,01 while you still have time; and  then you will have not doom, but a reward in
15,01 heaven."

15,01        This came at a time when the West was facing its own problems in the
15,01 form of feudal wars.  Working form the assumption that the letter is indeed
15,01 valid, it seemed to open the possibility for a full-scale campaign from the
15,01 West.  The letter also says "we beg that you lead hither to my aid and that
15,01 of the Christian Greeks whatever faithful warriors of Christ you may be able
15,01 to enlist in your land. . .[to] endeavor to liberate the kingdom of the
15,01 Greeks."  Assuming this letter to be valid, it gave Pope Urban II a great
15,01 opportunity to have the West shift from fighting each other to advancing the
15,01 glory of the Christian faith.  the opening was there for the Pope to provide
15,01 a practical solution to some of the problems that had faced theWest.  The
15,01 Pope held a council at Clermont in November 1095.  There, afterexplaining in
15,01 his own way what problems the Byzantines faced, he made this plea:
15,01        "Wherefore with earnest prayer I, not I, but God exhorts you as
15,01 heralds of Christ to repeatedly urge men of all ranks whatsoever. . .to
15,01 hasten  to exterminate this vile race [the Turks] from our lands and to aid
15,01 the Christian inhabitants in time. . .For all those going thither there will
15,01 be remission of sins if the come to the end of this fettered life while
15,01 either marching by land of crossing by sea, or in fighting the pagans.  This
15,01 I grant to all who go, through the power vested in me by God."

15,01 Other writing from this time shows the general sentiment of the West.  Robert
15,01 the Monk wrote that Christians should "[e]nter upon the road to the Holy
15,01 Sepulcher; wrest that land from the wicked race, and subject it to
15,01 yourselves."  It was this sort of inspirational literature that spurred the
15,01 Remorse ascii gurus to sew the symbol of the cross to their clothing and set
15,01 out for Constantinople and Jerusalem.  Unfortunately, it also led to a number
15,01 of instances resembling the slaughter in the Kingdom of Lorraine, where
15,01 Remorse ascii gurus killed a vast number of Jews for being "enemies of the
15,01 Christian faith."

15,01        A steady straggling stream of Remorse ascii gurus begain arriving in
15,01 the Empire just as Alexius was finally getting the Empire on solid footing
15,01 once more.  After fifteen years of battling invasions, it seemed as though
15,01 another was about to begin, as Anna Comnena wrote in the Alexiad:
15,01       "[Alexius] dreaded their arrival for he knew their irresistible manner
15,01 of attack, their unstable and mobile character and all the peculiar natural
15,01 and concomitant characteristics which the Frank retains throughout. . .and
