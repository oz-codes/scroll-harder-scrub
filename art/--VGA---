15,01An old woman came into her doctor's office and confessed to an 
15,01embarrassing problem. "I fart all the time, Doctor Johnson, but 
15,01they're soundless, and they have no odor. In fact, since I've been 
15,01here, I've farted no less than twenty times. What can I do?"

15,01"Here's a prescription, Mrs.Harris. Take these pills three times a day 
15,01for seven days and come back and see me in a week." 
15,01    
15,01Next week an upset Mrs. Harris marched into Dr.Johnson's office.   
15,01"Doctor, I don't know what was in those pills, but the problem is 
15,01worse! I'm farting just as much, but now they smell terrible! What do 
15,01you have to say for yourself?"
15,01    
15,01"Calm down, Mrs.Harris," said the doctor soothingly. "Now that we've   
15,01fixed your sinuses, we'll work on your hearing."
