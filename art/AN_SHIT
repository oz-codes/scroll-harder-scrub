15,01<HugzMan> hacking? u have peaked my interest
15,01<aneurJIZZ> ok, well, can you help me?
15,01<HugzMan> i dont know, what is the problem
15,01<aneurJIZZ> well, i need to talk to a hacker.
15,01<HugzMan> im not one... but i am a computer consultant
15,01<aneurJIZZ> oh.
15,01<aneurJIZZ> heh.
15,01<HugzMan> whats the problem?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> well, i was wondering if any hackers have ever
15,01  hacked into supermarket computers..
15,01<HugzMan> i haven't ever heard of a story... i wouldnt guess
15,01  there would be much to get
15,01<aneurJIZZ> well, it has to do with the chaos theory.
15,01<HugzMan> chaos theory?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> well, prepredicting food prices, see, i figure if
15,01  a hacker was to hack into the computers, that he might
15,01  beable to figure out food.. supermarket=food, food= car
15,01  stereos.. understand..
15,01<HugzMan> got it
15,01<aneurJIZZ> you understand?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> see, food=car stereoes
15,01<aneurJIZZ> so if we had lotsa food, we could have lots of
15,01  assembling of car stereos
15,01<aneurJIZZ> people need to make car stereos..
15,01<aneurJIZZ> the assembly of car stereos is vital
15,01<HugzMan> so u are just afraid a hacker will hack into a
15,01  supermarket computer
15,01<HugzMan> id worry about something else
15,01<aneurJIZZ> you dont understand do you.
15,01<aneurJIZZ> we need hackers
15,01<aneurJIZZ> hackers = assembly of car stereos= net profit =
15,01  food prices skyrocketing.. = the chaos theory = crash of
15,01  futures = more time for sex
15,01<HugzMan> i do understand, but...
15,01<HugzMan> i just dont think its something to worry about
15,01<HugzMan> hahaha.... i like that
15,01<aneurJIZZ> do you understand now?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> can you help me
15,01<HugzMan> i dont think i can
15,01<aneurJIZZ> i need help.. i need hackers.. i need sex..
15,01<HugzMan> there are easier ways to find sex :)
15,01<aneurJIZZ> look, you need to understnad this.. the theory is
15,01  vital to survival of the universe..
15,01<aneurJIZZ> i need a hacker to help to understand some of the
15,01  basic ideas of the beginning of the universe
15,01<aneurJIZZ> =survival when neo nitro comes..
15,01<HugzMan> i think ive had enough chaos theory for one night,
15,01  thanks, its been funny :)
15,01<aneurJIZZ> i need a HACKER = FOOD PRICES go up = CAR STEREOS
15,01  = NET PROFIT
15,01<aneurJIZZ> YOU STUPID BITCH
15,01<aneurJIZZ> UNDERSTAND ME
15,01<aneurJIZZ> AND I"LL FUCK YOU
15,01<aneurJIZZ> FOR 24 HOURS
15,01<HugzMan> wait a minute, so you need a hacker
15,01<HugzMan> to tap into the supermarket
15,01<HugzMan> and raise food prices
15,01<HugzMan> to..
15,01<aneurJIZZ> create car stereos, which will cause inflation..
15,01  which will cause people to go to the supermarket rather than
15,01  spend money on crack cocaine like i did.. i mean, uh..
15,01<HugzMan> are you on crack?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> SHUTTUP! ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?
15,01<HugzMan> what?
15,01<aneurJIZZ> look, are you goign to hack for me or not?
