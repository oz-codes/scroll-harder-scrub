15,01[Paradise]

15,01Sit here in my corner of the world
15,01Reality just a few steps away
15,01Sun beaming, waves crashing
15,01My world is here and here I stay

15,01Around me people walk unaware
15,01Of the lies and stories told
15,01A devilish laugh corrupts my face
15,01Sooner of later it must unfold

15,01Schitzophrenic, two faced beings
15,01I can't help being one
15,01Anger at others is anger in myself
15,01There is no cure, nothing can be done

15,01Water level raising
15,01Spraying my helpless soul
15,01Taking me out to sea
15,01Floating on my own

15,01Flash [Revolt]
