15,01 Yes, it's true, Night Daemon is dead.
15,01 I'm sitting here, typing this last sacrament for him 36 hours after he died.
15,01 I bet most of the people around the art scene known him, he was the leader of
15,01 Fuel VGA department, and a VGA artist in iCE, I wasn't much of a VGA whore,
15,01 but his shit was amazing, the guy truly had some talent, but I guess anyone
15,01 can tell you that, at least anyone who bothered looking at his stuff.
15,01 I'm here to tell you a bit beyond that, I'm here to tell you about the kinda
15,01 guy he was, the person he was.
15,01 Night Daemon (Levi was his real name) was a short, glass wearing, thin little
15,01 boy, he was 17 and he had a funny voice, I guess most of you would define him
15,01 as a nerd. In real life he had almost to no friends, and no girls at all.
15,01 He was a computer addict, and was one of the best sceners I had the privilege
15,01 to know, his real life sucked, no friends, no girls, no empathy from his
15,01 surroundings, why? Because of how he looked, and the way he acted in real
15,01 life.  See, in here, eather you step on other people, or you get stepped
15,01 on yourself, I was stepped on, and I also stepped on other people on my way to
15,01 where I am now. Levi (nd) didn't step on anyone, he was too kind of a person
15,01 to do that, and that's why he got stepped on in real life, got banned from
15,01 the society surrounding him, and in his grief, he went to the one place, that
15,01 irronicly doesn't consider the way you look - the internet.
15,01 He soon stepped out because of his talent, and because he was an intelligent
15,01 person to talk to, and got up to lead the best damn VGA devision in the scene.
15,01 Everything was alright for him, and went well, until a neighbour of his in
15,01 life entered the scene as an ascii artist, he called himself various names,
15,01 but was known as stalker.  Stalker envied nd's success, and began trashing
15,01 him, showing his picture to everyone, taking over channels he was in, and
15,01 turning that last piece of life he had into a living hell.  The rest of the
15,01 Israeli art scene, except for a few people who were adult enough, started
15,01 making fun of him too, started trashing him cause of the way he looked and
15,01 acted in real life, which had nothing to do with his scene life, and he was
15,01 hurt, he got disappointed of the israeli scene, and sticked only with his
15,01 groups and his art, talking to 3 or 4 israeli sceners, including myself.
15,01 Then came these horrible two weeks for him, he left school for some reason,
15,01 got depressed, then his Mom cut his internet account down or something like
15,01 that, and broke his only connection to a good life, he got depressed more and
15,01 more, and jumped out of the 9th floor into his death.
15,01 When I found out about it, I was shocked, went over to pS's place since I have
15,01 no internet for now, and found out that the same people who dissed and bugged
15,01 nd while he was alive, opened a channel called #we-r-sorry and started
15,01 creating an art pack in his memoriam, and made it all look like some god damn
15,01 circus, they said they were sorry and shit, well, i guess it doesn't help now
15,01 that he's dead, doesn't it?
15,01 We lost a great artist, and a good human being, one of the only prides of the
15,01 Israeli art scene in the last couple of years, I'm sorry I didn't have the
15,01 chance to talk to him on the last couple of weeks, I'm sure I could've found
15,01 out alot more, Night Daemon, my friend, rest in peace, wherever you are,
15,01 I'll miss you alot, friend.
