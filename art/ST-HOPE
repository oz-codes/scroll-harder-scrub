15,01Hope

15,01Fall to winter passes as seasons age.
15,01Leaves from branches fall as hairs from heads retreat;
15,01Fertile nature fades as memory's loss brings rage;
15,01Days shorten, nights fortell of endless sleep.

15,01West winds howl, all creatures are affected.
15,01Snow, youth's friend for age, is but a deadly foe;
15,01All beings search for cover once so easily protected;
15,01No solace found in water's frozen flow.

15,01Icy meadows harbor neither man nor beast,
15,01Death is about, all live from week to week.
15,01Too late our sun arises in the East,
15,01What once was strong and able, is not feeble and meek.

15,01Winter desolation decries old age,
15,01Yet spring's promise is born an infant sage.
