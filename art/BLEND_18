15,01     Smurfs and Communism

15,01     By Brad Stein

15,01          Has anyone ever really considered Smurf politics? If
15,01          you have, you would realize that the Smurfs are
15,01          communists. The dictator is of course Papa Smurf, who
15,01          has a Marxist-like beard, a red hat and most
15,01          importantly incredible magical powers.

15,01          The Smurfs live in a hidden mushroom villiage. The
15,01          villiage is so hidden that everyone who finds it,
15,01          forgets it's location immediatly! Smurfs have
15,01          designated jobs according to their assignment from Papa
15,01          smurf. Some Smurfs work on the farm, while another
15,01          cooks, more pick smurfberries, etc. The Smurfs do not
15,01          have a currency because "The Man" (papa smurf) has it
15,01          worked out that everyone is taken care of and receives
15,01          an equal share. Although Papa smurf is a communist
15,01          leader, he is a positive role model for the smurfs that
15,01          need direction. He cares for all smurfs equally and has
15,01          no interest in expanding his power. Papa smurfs main
15,01          interest is protecting his preciously entertaining
15,01          villiage.

15,01          Their is almost no free thought in Smurf Villiage,
15,01          aside from that of Brainy Smurf who is the designated
15,01          inventor. Not all smurfs have names, all others are
15,01          just smurf. This unit-like title is repressing freedom
15,01          and the fact that they all look exactly the same makes
15,01          the little blue guys even more uniform. They all live
15,01          in remarkably similar mushroom quarters with
15,01          decorations limited to pictures of mushrooms and Papa
15,01          Smurf. The fact that there is only one female expresses
15,01          the obvious repression of women.

15,01          In Smurf Villiage it seems there is one small exception
15,01          to everything. All smurfs are cheerful except Grouchy
15,01          Smurf, None of the Smurfs are artistic except Painter
15,01          Smurf. In every trade there is a single smurf that
15,01          excells. This serves as a model for communism because
15,01          every smurf does his part in the cycle to complete the

15,01          circuit. The villiage runs extremely smoothly except
15,01          for a single conflict in every episode. There is no
15,01          religion in smurf villiage, but all smurfs have morals
15,01          and good values aquired through lessons learned from
15,01          other smurf's mistakes.

15,01          Gargamel and his trusty cat Azriel are the smurfs
15,01          eternal enemies. They are life size, yet the smurfs
15,01          stand only three apples high. This signifies that the
15,01          enemy is much larger but still cannot defeat Papa
15,01          Smurf's miniature magic.

15,01          The smurfs expanded the imagination of children all
15,01          over the world for many years. By being a nuetral color
15,01          like blue they did not exhibit prejudice in any way.
15,01          Smurfs paved the way for cartoons like Snorks and a
15,01          market of Smurf coloring books and figurines. The smurf
15,01          dynasty existed right in the middle of the cold war.
15,01          It's awkward thinking that one of America's favorite
15,01          saturday-morning cartoons was a blunt expression of
15,01          successful communism. The same policy that our
15,01          government fought for twenty years.
