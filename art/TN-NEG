15,01Negative Life

15,01going through life seeing negative situations
15,01since you have long ago realized there is nothing postive in this world
15,01laughing at the optimists becsuse you know how much a fool they are
15,01people telling you are insanse since you are like this
15,01but you know it's them thats insane and not you
15,01you have awakened to the lies of the world
15,01awakened to the lie of happiness
15,01you know that all feelings of happiness crash and burn
15,01into the feelings of dread and dispair
15,01awakened to the lie that there is love
15,01but you know there is only hate and anger that
15,01is stronger than any lie that you once believed...
