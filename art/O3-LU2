15,01| "I Wanna Love You" by Anticapella.
15,01: Final Release on 05/06/94, (C) Ozone/DiE/Brutal.
15,01  (That's DD/MM/YY format for you yanks!).

15,01  Format
15,01  ~~~~~~
15,01  # M.K. (4 Channel) New ProTracker Module.

15,01  Background
15,01  ~~~~~~~~~~
15,01  This took me a couple of days to do, which is a normal time period of a
15,01  sampled MOD of this length for me, since I have school & other great things
15,01  like that to attend to. I released a 'very-near-finished' version around
15,01  Sydney on a couple of boards - this version is a little bit more fixed up
15,01  and contains more groovy sample names :).

15,01  This was my first sampled module in several months (6 months?!), but I
15,01  think it's one of my better releases. I recorded the samples at 22KHz/11KHz
15,01  (except for samples 9, 10, 11 and 16 which are ripped from various modules
15,01  which I can't remember) on a GUS with PLAYFILE and edited them with the
15,01  Digital Audio accessory in MMPM/2 (the OS/2 multimedia thingie). Most
15,01  editing was done in ScreamTracker 3.01B, and final adjustments were made
15,01  with ProTracker for GUS 0.6.

15,01  Bitchin'!
15,01  ~~~~~~~~~
15,01  Amiga MOD players (or any 60Hz timed players) should adjust their timing to
15,01  141bpm. PC people must have a player that supports the retrigger (E9?)
15,01  function, or they'll hear a couple of missing notes near the end. Note that
15,01  Inertia Player does NOT support the retrigger function :(.
