15,01<blk_jack> He wants me to merge mimic into the new odelay
15,01<blk_jack> and I'd be a normal member
15,01<blk_jack> and he'd massregulate through mimic's roster.
15,01<whirr> how very gracious of him.5 1998
15,01<blk_jack> yah disco74 (~disco@ts7-5t-27.idirect.com)

15,01<blk_jack> if I don't do it.. I dunno what he's gonna try & do merge into some g
15,01<blk_jack> He wants me to do it, cuz he knows that I'm only in the scene still f
15,01or 1 reasoni've been hearing they dont even have enough art for a small pack, li
15,01<blk_jack> and that's mimice's been slacking off.. etc..
15,01<whirr> but wouldn't merging mean giving that up?
15,01<blk_jack> Yupry interesting.
15,01<blk_jack> It would mean me .. quitting the scene.
15,01<blk_jack> basicallyhave plans.. 
15,01<blk_jack> I wouldn't head the new odelayut if it fails basically we're screwed 
15,01<whirr> well that's fucked.
15,01<blk_jack> he just asked "Why are you reluclant to kill off mimic"
15,01<whirr> uh huh.4> yeah, we're planning the downfall of karma, and planning the r
15,01<blk_jack> then he goes "you know, you wouldn't kill it off"
15,01<whirr> mimic is viable.hifting the artists over?
15,01<blk_jack> "basically, with our combined forces, we would have the #1 art group 
15,01in the scene"o74> basically killing karma, and not shifting artists over, giving
15,01<blk_jack> viable?rtunity
15,01<blk_jack> I'm quoting himnd bj's back i'm going to do it with psylock..
15,01<whirr> as in 'don't kill it off'. other motifs than just to make the rise of as
15,01<whirr> as long as it's vigorous, why do anything to it?
15,01<blk_jack> oho74> My plans aswell, are to plan the downfall of mimic, one step a
15,01<whirr> do you just talk to him, or is he a friend?
15,01<blk_jack> I don't plan toat that.
15,01<blk_jack> I thought about it when he first suggested it.
15,01<blk_jack> I consider him a friend.
15,01<blk_jack> But, he's a bit messed upnd do what sargon couldn't do.
15,01<whirr> i wouldn't have thought too much of this, except that so far he has zero
15,01 subs for rmrs28.e at some point.
15,01<whirr> i found that odd.e any more.
15,01<whirr> which suggested he was getting ready to act soom.
15,01<whirr> soon.o74> he wanted to control the scene..
15,01<blk_jack> you know why?ne giant super group..
15,01<blk_jack> You know why he's like this now?
15,01<blk_jack> You wanna know why he's doing this?
15,01<blk_jack> I know all about it.d 3 small groups to form serial..
15,01<whirr> part of me wants to say that it's because wh0d told him to stop "fucking
15,01 experimenting".
15,01<blk_jack> :)o74> but cain backed out at the last second..
15,01<blk_jack> It's because of thisomethign to compete with remorse, but in actualit
15,01<blk_jack> when he joined remorse, he wanted to take it over ascii artists, all 
15,01<whirr> and he essentially said that on the mailing list when there wasn't any l
15,01eadership.  about how he wanted to do it.out. ;)
15,01<whirr> but i beat him to it.rgon, cain, discyple, the prodigy, konami, polymorp
15,01<whirr> plus i got all the support. :)
15,01<blk_jack> hrm74> even i would have been in the group, but i quit serial because
15,01<whirr> i still have a copy of that message too.
15,01<blk_jack> he was pissed that whodini always threatens to take his masters.
15,01<whirr> now that's new info.
15,01<blk_jack> he's pissed that he doesn't get to do shit, but he thinks he does eve
15,01rything in remorseIf i cant, or it becomes too difficult, i'm going to drop it
15,01<blk_jack> (recruiting, gathering subs, etc)step leads.
15,01<blk_jack> he told me this month he wasn't gonna do a thing about that
15,01<blk_jack> he told me he wanted to join mimic, toodeath.. and we havent done any
15,01<blk_jack> but then he got this idea where he would make odelay
15,01<whirr> he doesn't get to do shit?way to do it.
15,01<whirr> excuse me?yeah, But.. I dont know why i'm even talking about it.. meh..
15,01<whirr> every fucking month, i ask him if there's something he wants to do or sa
15,01y.
15,01<whirr> he says no. of this, seeing as we'd been doing good things with remorse,
15,01<whirr> and then he goes and recruits without asking anyone.
15,01<whirr> like cat-dog.d, so i had to follow it up:
15,01<whirr> i show up one day to see "i let cat-dog in to remorse.".
15,01<whirr> and that's it.eaving Remorse after this pack, just thought you wanted to
15,01<blk_jack> hrmn kinda idle right now. we'll talk more later. .
15,01<whirr> which leads me to think that he outright stole an app from me.at is buyi
15,01<blk_jack> sorry, back brainchild?
15,01<whirr> just yesterday i think.
15,01<whirr> someone wanted to apply to remorse, i said send to me, he said "no, just
15,01 send it to me".
