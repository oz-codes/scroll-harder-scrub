15,01        "The escort's riding the bike," Turnbull said, pulling his head in from
15,01the window. "They're coming this way, moving pretty fast."
15,01        "Take him out," said McAlister, peering through his scope. "Hurry up.
15,01They'll be in the target zone in a few seconds. I'll take Elminster."
15,01        Without a word, Turnbull turned back to the window and took careful
15,01aim with his RSG. When the lead bike got within range, he snapped back on
15,01the trigger.
15,01        But it's true what they say: moving targets ARE harder to hit than
15,01still ones, never mind one that was zipping along at over 160 kph.
15,01Turnbull's shot went wide and instead of hitting Tony in the chest where it
15,01was intended, it rose a bit high and caught his injured arm.

15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        Tony gave a monsterous yell this time and his entire body jerked back.
15,01The Genesis wobbled and threatened to tip over but he managed to stabilize
15,01it a bit with his good arm, borrowing enough time for him to turn the
15,01straight driving speed into a wide, sweeping fish-tail arc. The bike then
15,01DID tip over, throwing both him and Elminster from its back.
15,01        A large part of his survival demanded that Elminster know how to jump
15,01or fall from a moving vehicle and had the bike not been going so fast, he
15,01would have come out of this particular crash with little more than a few
15,01scrapes, bruises and, if he had been really unfortunate, a sprained
15,01something-or-other. But speeding has its consequences. He fell awkwardly on
15,01his right shoulder, dislocating it, before he rolled to a full and complete
15,01stop in the middle of the road.
15,01        Tony was not so lucky. He was tossed, weak and weary, off to the side,
15,01sliding across the pavement until he slammed up against the curb, breaking
15,01what was once his good arm in two different places. There he laid for a
15,01moment, panting and too weak to do anything but groan and cry.
15,01        Then he remembered the two Manhunters who were giving chase and slowly,
15,01he rolled himself onto the sidewalk and, wincing with pain, pulled himself
15,01to his feet. He paused, standing in front of a clothing store looking like a
15,01zombie with both arms hanging limply down, his body smeared with red and
15,01wondering what to do next. Even if he COULD fire his M-16 which he spotted
15,01lying next to the motorcycle with the strap tangled loosely around one of
15,01the handgrips, there was no way he would be able to aim it nor even CARRY it
15,01for that matter. But he was going to try anyway.
15,01        He took a couple of steps out into the street and then froze. A pool of
15,01light ran at his feet, hugging the road. He looked up and found himself
15,01staring into a pair of round headlights. He shut his flashblinded eyes and
15,01backed away, trying to move towards his gun which was still a good twenty
15,01feet behind him.
15,01        The Genesis stopped and the Manhunters drew their guns. The rider
15,01dropped his old clip and reloaded his Uzi with a new one that had a silver
15,01stripe painted near the bottom of it. And then the two of them started
15,01firing.
15,01        Tony shuddered and shook as each round dug through his body armour and
15,01found their way into his chest and abdomen where they went about, merrily
15,01shredding his inards.
15,01        The shooting finally stopped when their guns ran dry and their clips
15,01were empty and Tony fell backwards like a felled tree onto the street
15,01carrying fifty-seven rounds of teflon 9mm in his vital organs.

15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        Still dizzy from being thrown from the motorcycle, Elminster drew out
15,01the Davao with his still functioning left hand and fired off the last round,
15,01missing the Manhunters by a good six inches.
15,01        He picked himself up hurriedly and scrambled for the HK which had
15,01managed to skitter all the way to the other side of the street, not even
15,01wondering about how he was going to reload the damned thing.
15,01        It turned out that it didn't matter because as soon as he got up, he
15,01felt something like a .357 Magnum round strike his chest followed
15,01immediately by a pinprick. He took a few reeling steps backwards and fell
15,01over. The world started spinning and he collapsed weakly on the ground in a
15,01cold sweat with everything around him fading to black.

15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        "Bottle Rocket to Black Cat. What is your situation?"
15,01        "We're still in pursuit," replied Kosk. "How are things on your end?"
15,01        "We've got Elminster so we won't be needing the girl," Bottle Rocket
15,01responded. "But get Sanderson if you can."
