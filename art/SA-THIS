15,01Would you believe I still ache?
15,01This subtle beauty of the petals
15,01falling into the snow
15,01It's melted now, 
15,01it's cherry blossom season again.
15,01"Time for love and renewal."
15,01I told him.
15,01So, is it my turn now?
15,01Or it is again
15,01the beginning
15,01of the crumble?
15,01 
15,01I urge not to edit, yet I am
15,01confined, contained
15,01my confessional strained
15,01through tear-stained cloth
15,01that rides on a distant shoulder-
15,01Once bitten.
15,01Twice betrayed.
15,01Razor blade madness still shines
15,01In glacier eyes.
15,01 
15,01Would you believe she's dying? I'd like to say
15,01conversationally
15,01(if any of you would understand
15,01or maybe you would.)
15,01but we all know 
15,01dying things cling hardest
15,01to their liferafts
15,01and so I am tangled
15,01in her barbed-wire arms again. (still?)
15,01 
15,01No, no, this mannequin of who I speak
15,01does not have a flesh and blood form.
15,01You have never *knowlingy* shook her hand.
15,01It would have been colder and stronger than mine
15,01if you had had the chance to.
15,01Like my nails on a rainy night.
15,01 
15,01You once held her/i/us one night
15,01I saw the fear in your eyes.
15,01Or was it mine, reflected?
