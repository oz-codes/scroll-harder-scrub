02,01  F12i10r00st, my BioS went blank ... I spent three days looking for the hard dr10i12v02e
02,01  c12o10n00figuration ... No auto-detect HDD in my BioS so ... Anywayz, I lost th10r12e02e
15,01                               02d12a10y00s doing so 10.12.02.

02,01  T12h10e00n my config.sys and autoexec.bat became corrupted due to some file wh10i12c02h
02,01  w12a10s 00promising to replace my ANSi-driver with some more powerful ANSi-driv10e12r02.
02,01  I12t 00was so powerful my config.sys messed up and my autoexec.bat went berse10r12k02.
02,01   Q12e10m00m was trying to pull off some odd tricks and I spent one day trying 12t02o
15,01             02p12u10t 00things back to normal ... Backups ... Right ... 12:02)

02,01    T12h10e00n I spent one day trying to read a tape I got from someone which 10w12a02s
02,01  f12o10r00matted in some strange format ... Due to the fact that my tapedrive is 12a02n
02,01 e12x10t00ernal one (okay, it's my fathers, not mine, where would I possibly get 10t12h02e
02,01   m12o10n00ey to buy me a tapedrive :) I couldn't read the damn tape ... Spent 10o12n02e
02,01   d12a10y 00searching for solutions but I still haven't found a reasonable one 10.12.02.
15,01             02N12e10x00t ANSi will cost you a tape drive ! Just joking 10.12.02.

02,01 T12h10e00n my parents found their phonebill ... And they went berserk on me ... 10S12o02,
02,01  I 10w00on't be calling anywhere anymore ... Only on somewhat rare occasions l10i12k02e
15,01                 02w12h10e00n uploading some TRiNiTY stuff at a HQ 10.12.02.

02,01  F12i10n00ally, school started again and I've had heaps of work ... Considering 10t12h02e
02,01  f12a10c00t that I'm 24 years old and just started school again after having tr10i12e02d
02,01  w12o10r00k, I suppose I'll have to get it right so ... Not much time left to dr10a12w02.
02,01  T12h10i00s does NoT mean that requests will no longer be handled, on the contra10r12y02.
02,01  A12n10y 00Request now costs between 10 and 20 US$, without exception ... Damn 10i12t02,
