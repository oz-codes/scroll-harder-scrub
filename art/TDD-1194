15,01   |========[ Group News : ]============================================|     
15,01 +.|  As you probably noticed, the school started for most people since |.+   
15,01 | | our last pack came out, and our members have not been able to do   | |   
15,01 | | as much work as fast as before, which is why our packs will from   | |   
15,01 | | now on be less regular. <And it's not like they ever been regular  | |   
15,01 | | before, since this is only our third pack. >                       | |   
15,01 | |  Another funny thing happened since the last pack:                 | |   
15,01 | | some lame boards started to turn up all around 718 AC, claiming to | |   
15,01 | | be TDD Member Boards. ONLY THOSE LISTED IN THIS FILE ACTUALLY ARE. | |   
15,01 | | Just because a board carries a piece of TDD artwork DOES NOT MEAN  | |   
15,01 | | that it is a TDD member board.                                     | |   
15,01 | |  You will notice that this pack is somewhat bigger then the last   | |   
15,01 | | one. It is due to the fact that we finally got a great VGA for you | |   
15,01 | | (thanx, PO), and while we still do not have ace coders, we were    | |   
15,01 | | still able to make up a few intro's with the tools that we have.   | |   
15,01 | |========[ Member Concerns : ]=======================================| |   
15,01 | |  One of our artists, CHAPLIN, has left our midst seeking a better  | |   
15,01 | | life, and started his own group called PIC. "NO", as he would say, | |   
15,01 | | "NOT `PARTNERS IN CRIME' !!!". His "PIC" stands for something so   | |   
15,01 | | weird that I am not even going to try and repeat it here.Of course | |   
15,01 | | we all wish him luck down the road.                                | |   
15,01 | |  I am also sorry to inform you that one of our most active members,| |   
15,01 | | who also thinks that I am a blabbermouth, has temporarily left the | |   
15,01 | | 718 scene, and went away to college. But he does call us up once   | |   
15,01 | | in a while. A big "WE MISS YOU" goes away to RALPH LAUREN.         | |   
15,01 | |  There is also a TDD member who deserves to recieve some credit    | |   
15,01 | | for the hard work he's been doing for this group. Although he is   | |   
15,01 | | listed as a courier, he also does regular software reviews for our | |   
15,01 | | WHQ, ~TSL, and participates a lot in the group itself. Even though | |   
15,01 | | he only uploads his reviews to ~TSL itself, they have been known   | |   
15,01 | | be uploaded to other boards of the area code. Let's hear it for    | |   
15,01 | | our own TORNADO.                                                   | |   
15,01 | |  Then of course there is POSYDEN. The best artist in the group, he | |   
15,01 | | joined us before the last pack, and since then did not stop to     | |   
15,01 | | producing top-quality ANSi's for those who really deserve them.    | |   
15,01 | |  And last, but not least, a big THANX goes to POWER BLADE, GOBLIN, | |   
15,01 +.| CRYPT KICKER and our newest member - TRINITRON for superb work     |.+   
15,01   | despite all the obstacles <LIKE SCHOOL>                            |
