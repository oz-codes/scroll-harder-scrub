15,01My eyes half closed and clogged with sleep,
15,01my mind clouded with thoughts obscure.
15,01Hope is lost, my fear runs deep.
15,01Between dream and reality live I, unsure.
15,01I am adrift, anchored in neither.
15,01Seeking some foothold in life or sleep,
15,01my hands wildly claw the ether.
15,01But the truth brings a pain that burns deep,
15,01I am doomed to exist neither here nor there,
15,01to call this intangible world my home.
15,01Nothing is mine, all I own I share.
15,01In this dark limbo I am sentenced to roam.
15,01I feel alone in this strange land,
15,01but in the dim light misty forms take shape,
15,01and in fear I flee through the sand,
15,01trapped in the Hades they call the DREAMSCAPE.
