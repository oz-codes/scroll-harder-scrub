15,01Necromancer here with a quick comment:

15,01        You all may be wondering why I'm releasing something that Sargon
15,01drew.. something that even takes the time to pass on a rip to Remorse.

15,01        Let me lay it out for you: Respect. Sargon did a lot of fucked up
15,01shit, and talked a lot of the same, but he certainly did get a response, and
15,01he certainly united Remorse against him. *grin* That's something that isn't
15,01easy to do.

15,01        Therefore, as he requested, I'll release this ascii in the Remorse
15,01pack.

15,01hi. this is my first ascii in over two months. i hope you like it. oh yeah,
15,01and for all of you, notice how i used dollar signs. there's this one character
15,01that people in my day used to used, called the dollar sign. some of the
15,01really really old guys like meatpod still remember it, but most of you
15,01came in before the dollar sign went "out of style", or just plain abandoned it.
15,01I really liked the dollar sign.

15,01I also liked it when the scene was cool. when artists were good. when there
15,01werent 10 discyple-wannabees, and 3 styles, all of which are used by over 50
15,01artists.

15,01Oh yeah, and i recall a time when the "top groups" were good. After looking
15,01at the remorse and odelay packs of late, it seems those days are long gone.

15,01save your precious scene.

15,01oh yeah, one more thing

15,01homo forever.
