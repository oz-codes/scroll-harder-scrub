15,01Close your eyes now,...go to bed,
15,01forget the demons in your head.

15,01Shut your ears, close your mouth.
15,01You cant say a word, dont scream or shout.

15,01Block out your fears, forget they were there,
15,01dont think of your burden too heavy to bear.

15,01Lock out the mosters, keep them away.
15,01Its scary at midnight when satan's at play.
