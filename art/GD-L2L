00,01Little too Late

00,01We're politically insane, time to drive 15this train
00,01Cord man let loose some steam, let 15that fuckin' whis14tle scream
00,01You better get outta the way, t15his trains not go14nna stop today

00,01Fear placed by mans imagina15tion, brand new l14ocomotive station
00,01Hey you get off of the 15track, or you won14't be coming back
00,01Station calls out w15histle blows, ste14amer is where they hose

00,01Young boy you b15etter go home, or 14get used to a covered dome
00,01Helpless yo15ur parents seem, 14your dead you see what they m06ean
00,01Lesson 15taught seems unfa14ir, young boy buried, everyon06e just stare

00,01Mot15her holds her wom14b, more comfy than the boys f06uture tomb
15,01Father looks on 14helplessly, everyone else see06s it indifferentl13y
15,01But who coul14d blame them, its their life 06the stitch must h13em

15,01Time pas14ses more sorry glances, they'06re hollow meaning13less, just empty stances
15,01The 14killing field now marred, by 06those who remembe13r, still feeled
14,01How cruel to set the bait, b06ut hey its a littl13e to late
