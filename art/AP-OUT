15,01Alone in the dark, only the
15,01demons in my head for company...
15,01I can't get out of here.

15,01My soul cries out for help,
15,01but is only answered by silence.
15,01I can't get out of here.

15,01Trapped inside, I'm confronted with
15,01myself, but all I find is emptiness.
15,01I can't get out of here.

15,01The stones I've thrown have
15,01built a wall around me.
15,01I can't get out of here.
