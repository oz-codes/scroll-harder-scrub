15,01intro: 
15,01        aight gz here, this is a nice lil proggy that will strip the ansi
15,01        escape code from color ansi/asciis and replaces them with the color
15,01        code in mirc. 

15,01to use:
15,01        use the nice lil "/play filename <delay>".. and to complie from mirc
15,01        do a lil run action.. anyways.. this is the script that i have under
15,01        popups\menu bar cuz i know yer all lazy people

15,01        best viewed at font terminal size 6, with a decent lengthed nick and
15,01        the room maximized, 80characters wide will fit on one line so it will
15,01        look nice nice.

15,01limitations:

15,01        well.. don't flood yourself, so keep the mircscii's to like 8 lines..
15,01        it all changes depending on server, bots, and all that fun stuff.
15,01        also all pics may not compile perfectly.. this will be fixed in 
15,01        future versions.. so hold on.. as for now.. it works pretty nice nice.
