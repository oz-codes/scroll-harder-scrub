15,01        It was a cold night in the deep void of Seattle.  Princess 
15,01Kaleia's cruiser (what we average folk call a bus) was under attack 
15,01from an Imperial Curbcruiser.  Emperor Gates called for Kaleia to be
15,01brought back for trial as a rebel against the Microsoft Empire.  
15,01Rebel spies had smuggled plans for Gate's plan to take over the entire
15,01os market with his engine of win95 destruction.  Admiral Necromango
15,01and Mon Reno we desperately hoping that the exploits gathered by the 
15,01spies would turn the tide of battle again the evil that is Microsoft.

15,01        The Curbcruiser disabled and docked with Kaleia's ship.Inside
15,01Kaleia's cruiser, she frantically tried to get the rebellion's bots to
15,01acknowledge her request.
15,01        "Dammit B0ar3P0, accept my chat!" she spat.
15,01        "I'm sorry princess, your password has been changed by one of
15,01the Linux Masters.  Try another bot instead"  B0ar3P0 recited.
15,01        "That's it, i'm gonna kick your ass right after i finish this."
15,01Kaleia quickly slipped past G0at2D2's defenses and planted the exploits
15,01where no imperial would ever hope to find it.
15,01        "Now get your b0t asses into the escape pod before i show you
15,01why the last bot ended up as a bit of useless fileserver!"
15,01        "Yes princess, as you command."
15,01        "D0 DEEP BOP B00P!"
15,01        "Shut the hell up G0at2D2."

15,01        Elsewhere, the princess was boarded (i mean, her ship) by a
15,01squadron of StoonTroopers, followed by the hideously evil Darth Balmer.
15,01        "Find the girl and bring her to me" he commanded asthmatically.
15,01        "Lord Balmer, we're not sure she IS a girl" a StoonTrooper
15,01responded.
15,01        "Like that really matters for what i have in store."

15,01        Moments later, the StoonTroopers return with the princess.
15,01        "Lord Balmer, only you could be so bold" she breathlessly 
15,01whispered.  "I am a member of the Microsoft Board.  What reason do you
15,01have to board me ship?"
15,01        "Princess, we KNOW that the rebel spies have been in contact 
15,01with this vessel.  Give me the data they transmitted to you and i shall
15,01allow you to...live...a while longer.  StoonTroopers, take her to my 
15,01ship!"

15,01-> THE SCENE WHICH NORMALLY WOULD BE HERE HAS BEEN CUT BECAUSE IT WAS
15,01TOO DAMNED BORING.  G0AT2D2 AND B0AR3P0 DO SOME ZANY WACKY KOOKY CRAZY 
15,01THINGS, END UP IN AN ESCAPE POD, EJECT, AND LAND ON THE INHOSPITABLE 
15,01WASTE KNOWN AS SOUTHERN OMIZONA.  SOME OTHER USELESS SHIT HAPPENS, THEN
15,01THEY ARE FOUND BY THE JAWAS AND SOLD TO SOME IDIOT FARMER FAMILY.  IT 
15,01IS THERE THAT WE RETURN TO THE STORY.  Now aren't you glad we skipped 
15,01all that shit?  <-

15,01        "I suppose these bots could use a good cleaning.  I'll get the 
15,01bath ready" whined Omi Skywalker.  "Dammit, i always have to do this
15,01bullshit.  Some day i'm going to get out of this hole and go to the 
15,01Academy and help the Linux Masters defeat the evil Microsoft Empire..."
15,01        "Sir, who the f#$% are you talking to?" B0ar3P0 tried to 
15,01politely ask.
15,01        "Bitch, you'd better shut your bot ass up before i beat you 
15,01like the slut you are."
15,01        "Yes sir."
15,01        "That's better.  Now what was this i saw about some stupid
15,01message that G0at2D2 is carrying?"
15,01        "Master Omi, it is a message meant for someone named Obiwh0d
15,01Kenobi.  The princess encrypted it so that no one but him could read
15,01it."
15,01        "PRINCESS?!  Aw damn, i always miss all the fun stuff.  Well 
15,01let's see if i can't just get around her code..."  ZAP!  "Ow!  What
15,01the..?"
15,01        An image appeared before them.  The princess was seen saying 
15,01over and over "help me Obiwh0d Kenobi, you're my only hope."  Over.
15,01And over.  And over.  Finally Omi just gave G0at2D2 a good slap until
15,01it stopped.
15,01        "Hmm, I wonder if it could possibly be old Whodiniggy that the
15,01princess is looking for.  Let's head out in the morning and track his
