15,01ANGER

15,01Welling up inside me like a fiery flood
15,01Travelling to my head is rushing blood
15,01Muscles all clenched, anger on the rise
15,01The next one to annoy me today, DIES!

15,01Each sound amplifies on each nerve
15,01Irritate me, and you'll get what you deserve
15,01Gritting teeth, trying hard to stay at peace
15,01Yet inside a volcanoe begs for its release

15,01The desire for destruction is uncontrollably strong
15,01I try to stop hyperventilating, but not for long
15,01The fire fever cannot be allowed to take my mind
15,01Inside myself I search, but what will I find?

15,01I am angrier than I have ever been right now
15,01I don't know why, I don't know how
15,01I feel white hot, I'm beginning to melt
15,01It surges inside me, wanting to be felt

15,01And now it's come to claim my brain
15,01Wrench my muscles, make me strain
15,01I just want it to go away
15,01WHY THE HELL AM I ANGRY TODAY??
