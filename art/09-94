15,01Well, another pack has snuck up on us again. You might not see as much as
15,01last's pack, but i kinda took it easy this month and not really did a
15,01whole lot. We will be back in High gear for the 10-94 release.

15,01We did alot of shuffling around with member positions this month. I got
15,01really tired of makin all the calls to people and shit like that. It will
15,01be a little better organized since we added a few new people to certain
15,01ranks. We welcome MOP (Master of Puppets) as our Global Cooridnator. We
15,01welcome Killer Bee as our Courier Cooridnator, Frog Snatcher as our
15,01Text Writer Cooridnator and FrY GuY as our Programming Cooridnator. Hopefully
15,01this will take a lot of pressure off of me and Exorcist. So we are glad
15,01to have the cooridnators in HR and look forward to working with you.


15,01Along with new cooridnators, we added a little to HR. We welcome Schizosynth
15,01in as our new talented RiP ARTiST, check his work out, it kicks some major
15,01ass. Also we welcome Armaggedon as a new artist, he's new, but he can draw
15,01and his best is yet to come. We had Tetsuo change his handle to
15,01Mr. Self Destruct, i didn't give him a good greet last time, but this time
15,01i will, He's very talented, he does some good art and i look forward to him
15,01producing more and better artwork. He also did the menus for my board.!!

15,01Some of the members haven't did jack shit again this month, your not gonna
15,01sit in the group and not do a damn thing, I, Exorcist, bust our asses to
15,01get work from certain people. If you don't see your name in the member
15,01listing your not in anymore. For the people that did do work good job.
15,01This pack is not that big, but it does have some good work in it. 


15,01On the lighter end, we are looking for some new HQ's, currently we are
15,01seeking a Western HQ, Southern HQ, and a new USHQ. These boards was either
15,01not up, or not wantin to do certain things for HR. If Interested call
15,01HiGH FiDELiTY and leave matrix feedback to me. Then we will discuss it
15,01voice. The WHQ changed it's name to HiGH FiDELiTY, it use to be
15,01Total Corruption.

15,01Distro Sites for HR will be thined also. I'm sick of trying to get stats
