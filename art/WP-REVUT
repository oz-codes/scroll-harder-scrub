15,01I can almost hear her voice
15,01The sweet harmonics reach out to me
15,01I can taste her lips so moist
15,01Her spirit running so young and free

15,01I can feel her flawless skin
15,01its silkiness worth more then money
15,01In the moonlight bright and dim
15,01Her blonde hair shines like golden honey

15,01I can see her sky blue eyes
15,01a watery heaven staring back at me
15,01I can feel her satin thighs
15,01The touch that showed my love to thee

15,01I can see her legs so tan
15,01catching glances as she walks
15,01I remember being her man
15,01the solo topic of her talks

15,01I can almost hear her voice
15,01echoing the stones with every wave
15,01I wish she didn't make that choice
15,01as I drop the flowers on her grave.
