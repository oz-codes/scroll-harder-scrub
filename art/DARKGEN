15,01-----------

15,01First, greets:
15,01Bigboy - What the FUCK is night exchange :)
15,01Tesla - DARKVIEW is awesome
15,01UCC - Why did you have to pick the same initials of my school ?
15,01Black Widow - He's my boss :)
15,01MicroSloth - Burn in hell please
15,01Novell DOS - For allowing me to run my buggy code without reseting each time


15,01When I saw the DARK Application form I said to myself "How can I get into 
15,01DARK with a minimal amount of work?"  I can't draw ANSI, do VGA, track MOD's
15,01but I can CODE!!!  (Sorta)  Anyway, because I'm to lazy to make my own
15,01Menus, etc. I used TVISION (With TP7) and I made an Application Generator

15,01If ANYONE knows about OOP could they PLEASE get in contact with me on
15,01NS (416) or the DARK WHQ!

15,01Anyway, first version of this this thing so have fun!
