15,01Meditations on Innocence

15,01        "What a beautiful child... let's withhold information from him and
15,01exclaim how cute it is when he doesn't realize that he's been lied to..."

15,01        "Let's abandon him in a web of lies and hypocrisy so deep, that when he
15,01finally figures out how much we've messed up his mind, his only choice left
15,01will be to rebel against the system which left him in this state, trying to
15,01figure out if any of his ten years or so of accumulated information is real,
15,01or if it's all just more Easter Bunnies and Santa Clauses."

15,01        "Then, as we watch him resign his defiance, and become accustomed to a
15,01lifetime of deceit, we shall know that we have effectively fufilled our roles
15,01as parents."

15,01        "Why, you ask? Why would one abandon a guiltless child into such a
15,01damnable fate?"

15,01        "Because we love him."

15,01        "If indeed, innocence is relatable to ignorance, which it is most
15,01readily so, then as ignorance is bliss, innocence is the illusion of happiness.
15,01An illusion so powerful, that it can still remain a controlling factor through
15,01the rage of discovering everything you know and hold dear to be made of
15,01formless cobwebs of myth."

15,01        "It is immensely more amusing to watch our flesh and blood muddle
15,01through life with blinded eyes than to provide him with accurate and unbiased
15,01facts."

15,01        "What? You say that our children should be improvements upon ourselves?
15,01Nonsense, my dear man. Evidently you don't know that the sole purpose of
15,01becoming a parent is to provide the accursed system with one more innocent
15,01slave to normality and conformity. We shall make our offspring as compliant and
15,01breakable as we possilbly can, leaving them with a gap to be filled with
15,01plastic imagery and meaningless numerals, which will, for some reason we are
15,01as yet inable to comprehend, fool them into thinking that they are happy."

15,01        "Remember the first kiss? The awkwardness of your first romantic
15,01encounter? Think of how history would be changed if we could think of the
15,01opposite sex as people, as opposed to painted, hairless orgasm machines?"

15,01        "Remember the shock when you found out that they WERE people? Real, 
15,01living, breathing people, entirely unlike the ones which you had been taught
15,01to relate with, the plastic characters on the static monitor?"

15,01        "Would you make your kids go through any less of a hell than you
15,01yourself were forced to go through, by people who thought they were doing it
15,01for your own good?"

15,01        "Of course not."
