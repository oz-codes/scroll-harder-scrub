15,01Heart shaped boxes line the aisles
15,01Filled with chocolate covered dreams
15,01Cards that say "be mine" stack the shelves
15,01All ready to be bought and purchased
15,01Marketed for those lovers who think of tangible material
15,01Living life, focusing on possessions, symbols of love
15,01It's not real...but it's human
15,01Walking through the store I see so many things...
15,01Things I could open my pocket book for and buy 
15,01For you...
15,01Does this prove my love?
15,01Does this tell you a damned thing?
15,01Perhaps it will...
15,01Perhaps it won't...
15,01Now you feel obligated...
15,01Guilty.
15,01I got you something, did you do the same for me?
15,01You could get something for me, and not spend a cent
15,01And that is you...
15,01you alone...
15,01All that ever mattered on this day of love...
15,01You could give it all to me...
15,01Not to open your purse and spend a paycheck...
15,01Wasting your hard earned money...on something that won't last...
15,01The cards on the shelf...the words "be mine" sum it up on this day...
15,01But yet you still wander the store, looking for those symbols...
15,01That is the only way you know...
15,01The way you choose to know...
15,01Today I give myself to you, only you...
15,01Will you do the same?
15,01Take all I have to offer...
15,01Possessions mean nothing to me...
15,01You are the only thing that ever mattered
15,01And you always will be...........
