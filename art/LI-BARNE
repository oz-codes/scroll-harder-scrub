15,01When I was young, my parents couldn't tear me away from the TV.

15,01If all I had to watch was Barney and Power Rangers, I would have gone outside
15,01every day.

15,01This is how I know the human race is devolving.

15,01TeeVee is the cheapest daycare.  Put your children in front of Barney and watch
15,01his caustic stimuli eat their brains.

15,01Why don't you just stuff your children into my big metal machine?  Feed them
15,01right in head first.  Watch them bawl and squeal in agony for a second, then
15,01silence, as their innocent little lives are snuffed out.

15,01It's less cruel than sacrificing them to Barney.
