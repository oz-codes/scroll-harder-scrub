15,01tum here, just thought i'd like to take this moment to mention that i'll be
15,01recessing a bit from the ascii scene. i'm tired and the scene is even more
15,01tired. i feel like an old, old man. many of my original scene friends are gone
15,01(mrk, sargon, drax) and it's become extremely difficult for me to draw lately.
15,01i remember looking at msd's final ascii pic, his "mixing atoms with angels"
15,01and reading the footnote, and wondering how someone could let go of something
15,01as fun as the scene. that was then and this is now. serial died, homo
15,01disappeared, the phone conf's that once were so common (probably due to my
15,01friendship with sargon) are becoming increasingly rare. and, of course, some of
15,01my main inspirations (terrato, axb, mrk) have ceased drawing. i am with only
15,01my peers in the scene. not my masters, as it once was. the enthusiasm isn't
15,01there. the compo's are gone, the close friends are not there, the eagerness
15,01that filled me when sending in my ascii's for submission (and, i'll admit it,
15,01apprehension) is gone.

15,01so i'm leaving. i promised myself i'd go out with a bang, and i did. my
15,01original goal when starting ascii was to join remorse, and through this obtain
15,01social acceptance from all my peers and consequently, be one of the eleet. =)
15,01and i don't think i could have had a more succesful ascii career. from start
15,01to finish, i've rapidly risen to pretty much the top spot in terms of all
15,01around ascii talent and position in the scene.

15,01message to skatter from a long time ago: "man, you get a million greets
15,01whenever you go on irc and get ops in #ansi and #ascii, AND you're in remorse!
15,01man, one day i'll be like that, and only THEN will i stop drawing. =)"
15,01skatter only laughed back. such a goal seemed far away at that time. i have
15,01surpassed that goal by a considerable degree.

15,01so this is my epitaph.
15,01and, as i mentioned to tsk a few days ago, it is also my confession. after much
15,01deliberation, and consideration, i have decided to reveal who i really am, and
15,01my unfortunate, unfortunate history.



15,01tum's life:

15,01i still can clearly recall seeing a lord jazz ansi in .. egh, 93? god i forget,
15,01but i remember seeing the way that he & other acid artists proudly flaunted
15,01their affiliation with what is clearly the most established and largest art
15,01group around. and i remember thinking (this was the end of eighth grade, mind
15,01you) "man, i wish i could be that eleet." my art scene career started then,
15,01unbeknownst to most of you. i am probably one of the most old newschool artists
15,01drawing around. 4 years, god. and you're probably thinking, "what? uhm. you
15,01just started drawing 3 months ago!" well, heh, not really.

15,01i started my scene career in ansi, under my original nick "hellspawn." during
15,01this time, i drew NOT ONE original ansi. i figured i didn't have the talent,
15,01so i ripped some of the biggest ansi artists of all time from cdrom.com..
15,01somms, bad karma, silver rat, rad man, shit you name it and i ripped em. and
15,01i didn't do subtle rips either. i was so damn new to the scene, that i merely
15,01took these 300 line pictures, rearranged the font at the bottom until it had
15,01a marginally good resemblance to the words "generation x", the name of one of
15,01my long time friends "0-7 day warez boards." we wanted to make it look eleet =)
15,01although many of you might not know this, 619 at that time was an extremely
15,01big art area. we had sushi bar z, lord jazz, tsk, prodiac, emperor, christ, we
15,01just had more than 20 art scene people in national groups, and god knows how
15,01many local artists. so, as expected, i was caught pretty fucking soon. =)
15,01pinguino, a local to me at the time, gave me a call (i assume she had been
15,01tipped off by tsk), threatened to take legal action, and i thought i was all
15,01bad ass by pretending i didn't know what ansi was, but i'm pretty sure she saw
15,01through my facade. anyways, after that i definitely did not learn. i changed my
15,01nick to "ash" ripped some more pics, joined a group, released em, got caught
15,01slickity shit quick and then left the ansi scene entirely. i also released a
15,01few ascii's at this time under this nick (dunno what year) and I DISTINCTLY
15,01recall being asked by a guy called st'forge (heh) to join a group called
15,01"forge" and getting accepted off of my ripped ascii's. (for those of you newer
15,01artists, st'forge is blackdawn). at the same time, i also remember being
15,01invited to join a new group, by the name of "trank." (no joke!) of course, i
15,01was trying to be as eleet as possible at the time, so i joined trank as well,
15,01and drew like 2 ascii's, but either i never sent them, or bothered to remind
15,01him that i was still in the group. but, how many newschool artists are there
15,01around that were in trank, eh?! fuck, even alot of oldschool guys weren't
15,01around then.. so kiss my veteran ass. oh.. i also got offered membership in
15,01noname when it was first starting.. but i didn't like the name.

15,01at this time, i decided to take a little break, and stayed away from the scene
15,01for quite awhile. suddenly, my, uh.. junior year (i think) i saw some of mrk's
15,01and axb's stuff and saw some good art boards that were going up locally
