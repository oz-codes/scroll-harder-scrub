14,01 This poem is one I call "home". I dedicate it
14,01 to a friend named Brynn, with whom I spent my
14,01 childhood with and have not seen in 3 years.

11,01one light shows itself in a dream.

00,01W10h11en
11,01one person walks down the street,

00,01a10n11d
11,01he is known to you but unknown.

00,01A10s
11,01the great tides receed,

00,01t10h11e
11,01moon bekoning them back to their land.

00,01A10s
11,01that one shooting star makes its path across the sky.

00,01W10h11en
11,01the fireflies begin to lose their their flare.

00,01W10h11en
11,01that one party is over and you feel deprived.

00,01W10e
11,01will all return to our safe havens.

00,01W10e
11,01will all return home.
