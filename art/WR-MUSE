15,01So what follows are some ramblings that i wrote last week when i was
15,01sick with the flu and fairly hallucinatory.  Some of it is kind of
15,01odd and a bit philosophical and mushy.  If that could bother you,
15,01then get the hell out of this file before you run around the room 
15,01screaming "OH MY GOD!  WINDRIDER, YOU BASTARD!  DON'T DO THIS TO ME!"

15,01        don't say you weren't warned.

15,01     Feb 11 (or near there)
15,01        Wow, i hope E____ is okay.  I'd hate to see anything happen
15,01to her, she's a pretty special woman.  Whatever it is, it's personal,
15,01otherwise she likely would have told K__ what was up.  I should check 
15,01to see if she, M_______, and T_____ are going to the pub.  H0h0, Frank
15,01looked like he was working hard correcting those exams in the library.
15,01I think any mark over a 0% is a bonus.
15,01        R____'s and idiot.  I can't really see him being a decent 
15,01teacher AT ALL.  Time to tryo out the other pen.  I think i've got to
15,01save those felt tips as part of my "remembrance shrine" to Biggar.
15,01They really helped me out a lot.  Hmm, i wonder if i should get John a
15,01copy of the article i gave Frank.
15,01        I hope E____'s in class tomorrow.  I just can't seem to get her
15,01out of my mind.
15,01        need to check the job postings tomorrow.
15,01        I'm an idiot.  I want to go to China with E____.
15,01        maybe i should suggest to her the possibility of taking it for 
15,01audit.  That could be fun.  oh shit, if she went she'd miss Convocation.
15,01I get the feeling it's the last time i'll see most of these people.
15,01That really saddens me.
15,01        Isn't it ironic, don't you think?  I get all set to run off to
15,01New Zealand and now i find someone that i'd give up everything for.
15,01Too bad it'll never happen, she's way out of my league.  My life was 
15,01just getting simplified too.  Christ, all i need now is for C______ to
15,01just start it all again and i'll be totally screwed.
15,01        Aw geeze, now i'm confused.  Did E____ 'look back' or would she
15,01consider that i looked back to her?  Odds are she doesn't even care, 
15,01and why would she?  I might as well just put on my "i should have at 
15,01least done SOMETHING" pedestal.  In another day or two i should find 
15,01out that there's a boyfriend, and that will be that.
15,01        and yet this is new.
15,01        if i had to describe it, i'd say i was setting her up as "THE 
15,01ONE" just so that i can punish myself.  Here's an idea if she's at the 
15,01pub... hell, if she's IN CLASS, make a broad sweeping question about 
15,01what people are doing for valentine's day.  if the situation presents
15,01itself, serve up the opportunity of just hooking up to piss the day 
15,01away.
15,01        she's got her own car, good sign.  no relying on as-yet 
15,01undetermined boyfriend.  (ex: Ni_____, now there was a dumb idea)
15,01        plays the violin, but supposedly "not very well".
15,01        fairly free story teller, make it an offer to her at some point.
15,01(ex: 'owe her a story', blah blah blah)
15,01        350 in her graduating class? wow.
15,01        hey, try to avoid making an idiot out of yourself.
15,01        i've gotto wonder what 'obsession' is defined as.
15,01        gotta write that rationale for John tonight.
15,01        what kind of stone was that in her 'flower' necklace?

15,01        genuinely interesting and enigmatic, how truly rare and 
15,01wonderful.  yep, i think she's got me.  i just have to hope she doesn't
15,01realize it.  otherwise, things could get odd.

15,01     Feb 23 (or close)
15,01        I'm really setting myself up for a big fall here.  One of two
15,01things will happen.
15,01                1)  She doesn't know i'm alive.
15,01                2)  She's involved with a god.
15,01        this shouldn't surprise me, since the intelligent and beautiful
15,01ones are always unavailable.  though i am concerned about this 
15,01disappearing act.
15,01        is there anything a guy in love wouldn't go for a woman?  
15,01history has shown that men will kill for love, but is it a grander
15,01gesture to kill or be willing to sacrifice all?
15,01        there again, true love shouldn't require you to hold on to the
15,01person you love.  the next step of selfless love is to give her freedom.
15,01even freedome from yourself.  it's a tough, often unrequited, and very
15,01RARE love.
15,01        maybe the knights and squires had it right in having their love
