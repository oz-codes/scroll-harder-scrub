15,01OK. Let me introduce myself. I am Reaper Wildwood, and in CaNCeR I am
15,01a Senior Staff member. I don't have much to really say as far as this pak
15,01goes seeing as how for the entire month of March i was a mere LIT/ANSi Artist 
15,01for CaNCeR, and have recently been given this new title. YOu will see a few
15,01of my works in here, but unfortunately they are my last works that will be
15,01for CaNCeR. I quit as an artist and became a staff member so i can devote 
15,01more time to the organization of the group, so that the future packs do not
15,01get delayed for weeks like this one was :). Basically, Lord FaNG/TsB/Dr. J
15,01and Blonde Hak Her are the founders, Ear is the Global Coordinator, and
15,01I am a senior staff member. We all seem to have equal influence/authority
15,01so i really don't see the point of titles. My point is, check this pak out,
15,01and if you wanna apply to CaNCeR fill out the app included, and call
15,01either Castle of Darkness and upload it or call up CaNCeR HQ, Powerslave 2,
15,01and Select the "Apply To CaNCeR" option from the Matrix Logon. There you
15,01Will be given the opportunity to upload your app and leave mail to myself
15,01other Staff members.
15,01        We are looking for CODERS since the boys we had didn't quite meet
15,01their deadlines. We are also ALWAYS looking for good ANSi/RIP/VGA/LIT 
15,01artists, Musicians, and what have you. And if you run a decent board 
15,01outside the 714 AC, feel free to apply as Dist. Site!
15,01        So that's it from me for this month. Look out for CaNCeR in 1994!
