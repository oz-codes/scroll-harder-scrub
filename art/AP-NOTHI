15,01I cannot love.
15,01only hate.
15,01There is no room in my heart for
15,01anything but hate and scorn.
15,01Others despise me, lie to my face, by
15,01telling me I'm actually worth something.
15,01I'm an empty shell. Hollow on the inside.
15,01I have nothing.
15,01I want nothing.
15,01I was nothing.
15,01I am nothing.
