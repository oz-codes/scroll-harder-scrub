13,01  David crept through the rooms of the flat he and his wife shared.
13,01Because she was a dancer, they had converted an extra room into a studio;
13,01mirrors and barsabove the hardwood floors.  David was an unemployed amateur
13,01geologist who dreamt of matriculating for a doctorate and regard.  He had
13,01an enormous appreciation for rocks. They were perfect, to him, the only
13,01thing perfect.  He liked to put them at strategic positions in the apartment,
13,01particularly in the studio.  His wife is always taking his rocks and hiding
13,01them somewhere, but he's never been able to find them.  It maddens him. He
13,01burns her toe-shoes so that she won't move his rocks, but she buys new ones.
13,01She was at rehearsal, and he was placing his rocks.
13,01  His wife's friends hated him.  He knew this, but didn't care.  They were
13,01ignorant. They didn't understand the genius of rocks.  They thought he was
13,01lunatic.  He thought they were aliens.  What is more permanent than rock?
13,01What is solid as rock?  What comes in as many colors, shapes, sizes?
13,01Nothing is as timelessly immobile.  He liked to move them; it was a worship,
13,01like the care of an ominous yet phenomenal person when they become infirm.
13,01They liked to be moved by him...only him, for he was their avatar.

13,01  David dressed warmly that night.  He pulled on his old greatcoat and
13,01pushed in the immense pockets he had installed. He deposited a large piece
13,01of white marble in the right one.  It was more than a handful.
13,01  He walked quickly up motionless backstreets and alleys, his breath a thick
13,01momentary mist leading his steps.  He neither whistled nor hummed nor spoke
13,01to himself; if he had a choice, he wouldn't have breathed either.  He
13,01wouldn't have moved or allowed himself to be so soft.  He was in despair
13,01by the time he reached the cemetery gates.
13,01  The gates were propped open, and he brushed through, following the dirt
13,01road across the neat fields of stones.  The gravel ground beneath his feet
13,01for several stepsbefore he considered it, bent to scoop up a handful, and
13,01cooed to it as he stepped onto the grass.  He slipped the pebbles into his
13,01pocket and began to thread his way around the stones, letting his fingers
13,01graze them as he passed. They were smooth, cut, and ordered.  His grief
13,01grew within him.
13,01  Rounding the side of a hill he came, finally, to the low, tin shed where
13,01an old mason cut stones for the new dead.  The man was hunched over a small
13,01granite plaque. He would chip away with a fine chisel, stop to brush the
13,01face with his hand, chip again.  He was absorbed in his work and the
13,01high-tensile music of it.
13,01  David drew the stone slowly from his pocket, charged the old man and
13,01smashed him three times in the back of the head.  Blood rushed from the
13,01crushed skull, pooling silently in the letters of the plaque.  David wiped
13,01the marble on the man's shirt, replaced it in his pocket, and wandered into
13,01the dark.

13,01  The next morning, David returned to the apartment.  A trash truck had just
13,01finishing dumping the dumpster into its compartment, and as it was lowered
13,01David recognized a rock behind the dumpster's spot.  He sped up the stairs;
13,01burst through the door.  There were no stones in the kitchen.  He ran into
13,01the studio; none.  He set thepiece of marble carefully on the hardwood planks.

13,01  David found his wife asleep in the bedroom.  He woke her gently and helped
13,01her to sit.  Holding her by the front of her nightgown, he hooked her with
13,01all he had across the chin.  Her head spun violently around.  He struck her
13,01once more.  She wentout, crumpled on the bed.  He moved to his closet and
13,01removed his heavy hand hatchet and his wooden Go board.  After sliding the
13,01board beneath her ankles, David raised the hatchet high and severed her feet
13,01with two sharp cuts.
13,01  He walked the rooms examining angles, lighting, color contrasts.  He chose
13,01her studio; set her feet in opposite corners of the room, facing one another.
13,01David watched them for days.  He slept in the studio; dreamt of them.  After
13,01two days, he had his revelation.
13,01  He carried her feet into kitchen and took a fillet knife from a drawer.
13,01Cutting in meticulous layers, he stripped them of the skin, muscle, ligaments
13,01and tendons.  He washed the blood off the bones in the sink.  He carried them
13,01back to the spots they had occupied before, and piled them into little
13,01pyramids.
15,01     13They were a realization; impediments not to be disturbed.
