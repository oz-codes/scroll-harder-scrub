15,01Turmoil

15,01inner turmoil causes such confusion
15,01the mind becomes deranged
15,01thought becomes useless
15,01there is another force at hand; emotions
15,01emotions that are uncontrolable
15,01if you fight them go insane
15,01if you don't insane just the same
15,01do things you thought you'd never do
15,01say things that don't make sense
15,01look at life in a different way
15,01see things differently that a normal person cannot understand
15,01to see beyond the lies, to see beyond just emotions
15,01to see what others are afraid to see
15,01to have no fear of what is going to happen
15,01to just not care
15,01all this is simple to obtain, just open your eyes
15,01to the inner turmoil that this world has laid upon you...
