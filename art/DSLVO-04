15,01          "Oh George, why did you do it?" his mother asked, her
15,01handkerchief soaked and soiled.

15,01          "I didn't kill anyone!  I don't even know who Arthur

15,01questioningly.

15,01aloud. "He maintained his innocence even when the axe came down."
15,01manners, everyone will stare at you if you shout."
15,01          The old woman folded up her newspaper neatly and tossed
