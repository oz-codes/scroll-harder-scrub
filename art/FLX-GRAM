15,01                    12Seventy eight years is a good long time,
15,01                    12It seems to me, looking on from my twenties
15,01                    12And so here I am, having just recieved the news,
15,01                    12Having not seen him since the diagnosis,
15,01                    12Off the phone with my father,
15,01                    12Thinking of my grandfather who's newly dead,
15,01                    12At peace, or gone at the least who knows where.

15,01                    12The preist says that my grandfather leaves a legacy
15,01                    12In the twenty three offspring gathered today
15,01                    12In this little church with it's white plastered walls
15,01                    12And water-beaded windows of Romans, Apostles, vines and cups

15,01                    12Look up, says the priest, for there is Heaven and your
15,01                    12father/grandfather/friend is there,
15,01                    12And I look look up through the windows
15,01                    12And watch the clouds slowly disappate beneath
15,01                    12The sun's beaming orb and the fields still wet
15,01                    12And fertile and my grandfather and myself
15,01                    12And the new spring shoots
