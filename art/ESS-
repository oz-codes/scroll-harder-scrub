15,01  I'm proud to say that REMORSE let me join their  `"n-**YY$$YY**-2^`  3SS iiiii
15,01  ranks of ascii artist and once again strengthened their                  :::::
15,01  groups power with another artist.
15,01  I would like to thank the REMORSE judging team to take a look at art from
15,01  a total unknown guy.

15,01  Some will think the euro-scene is weak, and that all those guys in that corner
15,01  can't do shit, but you're wrong! I'm from holland and though it's a small 
15,01  country the quality of local artists is relatively good. 

15,01  Some history: I got into the scene in 1995. I was musician and came in my
15,01  first group to make some tunes. After that I started coding and doing art. 
15,01  My next group would be a coding group called Excessive Force Crew (EFC), than
15,01  I moved on to art only and teamed up with FadeDESiGN and Expose. I left 
15,01  FadeDESiGN and focussed my art on Expose. I got my hands on MIRC, heard that
15,01  #ascii was pretty kool and THE place to meet famous artists, I decided to take
15,01  a long-shot contacting one of the guys (TUM!) from REMORSE to ask what they 
15,01  thought of my art. I'm glad I've taken that shot.

15,01  I'm glad having joined REMORSE and am planning to dedicate lots of time and
15,01  artistic curves to this group. Thank you REMORSE for letting me join your
15,01  fine ranks.
