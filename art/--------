15,01You are just a code,
15,01and not even given by the lords.
15,01It makes me wonder, that
15,01you can read all my thoughts.

15,01I've spend on you
15,01oh so many days,
15,01and all you have is a smile
15,01on your lovely face.

15,01Together with you,
15,01I've had my best times,
15,01and the feeling,
15,01that the sun shines.

15,01When I catched a first glimpse and saw
15,01the really fine label ACIDDRAW,

15,01I knew
15,01you are
15,01my
15,01destiny.

15,01[yes, it suxx. :)]
