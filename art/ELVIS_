15,01Elvis Presley was the host. He had spent months organizing for this event, and
15,01had done a flawless job at that.

15,01        There was a knock at the door. He quickly placed his apron on the
15,01counter in the kitchen, and answered it. Standing before him were John F.
15,01Kennedy, Jim Morrison, Jimmy Hoffa, and Leonardo da Vinci. He invited them
15,01in, offered them a seat, and brought them some punch and cocktail weiners.

15,01        He then went out to the backyard to fire up the barbecue. He had the
15,01usual sausages, but since Jimmy Hoffa was a vegetarian, he had to cook some
15,01tofu as well.

15,01        Meanwhile, Warpus was at Hennifer's house, discussing with him the
15,01most vile party-crashing-plot EVER! After two hours, three cases of tequila,
15,01and three trips to the bathroom by Warpus after eating the worms, they came
15,01up with the plan of the century!

15,01        They skateboarded over to Graceland, hid in the bush, and scouted the
15,01place out. They then ran around the house (on the side opposite of the party)
15,01and found the backyard.

15,01        After putting the sausages on the fire, Elvis went back inside to
15,01accompany the guests, with corny jokes, and stories of things that didn't even
15,01happen.

15,01        At the same time, Warpus and Hennifer were creeping through the back-
15,01yard, with a case of tequila (Warpus sure loves his tequila!), and 25 caps
15,01of amphetamines. They found the barbecue, opened it up, and dumped the
15,01the contents of the capsules on top of the sausages. They then closed it, ran
15,01around the same side of the house, and snuck into an open window. While Elvis
15,01was in his living room annoying the guests, they found their way into the
15,01kitchen, and dumped the tequila in the punch.

15,01        After about 20 more minutes, the party migrated outside to have
15,01sausages and punch (muahah!@). After they were done eating, Elvis and his
15,01band took the stage, and announced that they were going to perform their smash
15,01hit, "Jailhouse Rock". They tuned up, and began to play. The song started off
