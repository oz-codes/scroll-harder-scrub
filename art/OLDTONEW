15,01                             A TRiBE Overview.

15,01     How's that go?  You know, the addage about sleeping dogs?  Whatever, I'm
15,01sure you know what I'm refering to.  Here I was, less than two months away
15,01from a nice, quite "retirement" from drawing ANSi's, and what happens.  A
15,01second rate, would be despot, orchastraits a coup'de-tah-de-fuckin-da, and
15,01declairs himself a soveirn NaTiON, all supposedly in the name of "fun".

15,01     "Deja-fuckin-doodle-do.", you say?  Keep in mind, *I* publicly quit iCE
15,01and it was months before anyone who was in iCE at that time *ASKED* to join
15,01TRiBE.  Sure, in closing in on four years in this scene, perhaps it was the
15,01kismet of some of my past sins, but that incident wasn't one of them.  To
15,01paraphrase Tempus, "I see where you're coming from and agree with your
15,01decision."  Supposedly, NaTiON was in the planning stages for several days
15,01before the March Pack (TRIBE-10) was released, AND until the recent Gothic
15,01break-up, consisted mostly of TRiBE Members.

15,01     Regardless, this isn't about jumping up and down, pointing fingers at
15,01Maestro and the Musical Mayhem of his RyTHMiC NaTiON.  There has been and
15,01will be enough of that elsewhere, to be sure.  This is about an old,
15,01sleeping dog that some smart asses thought would be fun to give one last,
15,01hard, quick kick before he was put to sleep.  As the addage leads one to
15,01conclude, not the wisest of actions.

15,01     As I've chronicled elsewhere, TRiBE, in both name and function, was
15,01a joke.  Weeks before I came to the decision to leave iCE, whilst talking
15,01to Corigan about comics, (specificly how he hated the 'big butted black
15,01chick book' called Tribe) I joked that I was quitting iCE to start a new
15,01group that would only draw big butts, called, TRiBE.  When the time came
15,01that I actually did quit, I thought it humorous to start a "one man group"
15,01called "TRiBE", for that is what it was, just me.

15,01     Realisticly, however, as with most things, "it's just not fun by
15,01yourself".  Some were asked to join (such as Mr. Man and "the rest" of
15,01Mindless, Logan the guy who got me into ANSi and Dreamevil, another old
15,01bud from the LTD days.) and others came to me (such as the whole ChroniC
15,01mishap, Quazar, et al).  Before I knew it, TRiBE was in danger of becoming
15,01a "real group", in that it would look and opperate like all the others.
15,01I'd be having none of that.

15,01     At every oppertunity I bucked the scenes conventional wisdom.  No
15,01sites, no staff, no non-artists, no competition, you know it all by now.
15,01On the one hand, this was successful, as it kept things so loose, that
15,01TRiBE never got any real continuity to be actually considered as a group.
15,01It was as it claimed to be, a collection of individuals.  The only problem
15,01was that other hand, which was usually wraped around a knife that could be
15,01found stuck in my back.

15,01     No.  It was not "people leaving" that was ever the problem.  Anyone
15,01would have to be an idiot to think that a group setup and "run" (if you can
15,01call zipping packs running a group) like TRiBE could be a 'successful' group
15,01in so much as beinc capable of holding the attention or ambitions of the
15,01type of artists that populate the scene today.  From very early on, I was
15,01more than content with the PRIVATE thought that TRiBE was *THE* "Minor
15,01League" group the scene always needed, where talent could be developed and
15,01shipped up to the big game.  You can look at the member lists of groups out
15,01there and find quite a large portion of them having had a stint in TRiBE,
15,01which just happens to coencide with a noticable improvement in thier
15,01product.

15,01     The problem came, mostly in the actions of an admitedly few people who
15,01traversed thru the revolving doors that TRiBE was built with.  It would be a
15,01rather short list of rather well known overly-ambitious-under-achivers if I
15,01were to go thru, actually listing them on a case by case basis.  The only
15,01people who would "stand by" any of these people today, are afew people who
15,01happen to be in their same group, today.  I'm sure alot of you know alot of
15,01them, if not personally, than thier type.  They're frauds of the worst kind,
15,01two-faced opertunists who'll lie, looking you straight in the perverbial
15,01eye, most of them, at one time or another, having called you, friend.  They
15,01are betrayers of one of the only things holding this community together,
15,01trust.

15,01     Tired of the "all too real group like work" of having to find out who
15,01is or isn't still with you.  Tired of so called "friends" twisting the
15,01knife in you as they leave, I disbanded TRiBE.  In the next few seconds that
15,01followed my rash decision (that ended with a rather loud thud of hanging
15,01up a phone), that old dog stat striaght up with a very feral, very familar
15,01growl.  "These little shits just pissed on your grave.", he said.  I'd be
