15,01Chapter 1: It All Begins Here

15,01     From the distance, a shadowy figure could be seen walking
15,01gracefully down the high-tide line of a nameless Chicago beach. 
15,01His booted feet barely escaping the waters tarnishing flow, as the
15,01wind blew his long, beaten, coat behind him.  Pulling a crushed
15,01pack of Marlboro Red's from his inside breast pocket, he carefully
15,01took the last cigarette from its beaten home and lights it.  Stylus
15,01inhaled deeply the first puff of smoke; and feeling its warmth as
15,01it enters his lungs.
15,01     Quickly he turned and stared his prey dead in the eyes.  The
15,01fool had no idea who he was following.  He had no idea what he had
15,01gotten himself into when he decided Stylus would be an easy hit. 
15,01As Stylus' eyes begin to glow brightly, with anger and hunger, his
15,01predator, now become prey froze in it's steps.  And as often
15,01happens to mortal men when they realize death is upon them, he
15,01found that he could not move, and tried, hopelessly, to scream;
15,01managing only a meek whimper.  Before the thief had time to think
15,01about the mistake he'd made in even thinking about robbing this
15,01man, the hungry Stylus was upon him.
15,01     Split seconds later the would be thief lay at Stylus' feet,
15,01bleeding, unconscious, ready to be drained of his soul and his foul
15,01memories.  The stench of evil was strong on the incapacitated feed-
15,01flesh and Stylus knew he would hate the sting of the memories when
15,01he drained the criminal of his thoughts; but he needed food badly. 
15,01It was becoming hard for him to remember the last time he had fed.
15,01     Stylus arched backwards, arms outstretched, as the meal's
15,01memories and soul mixed with his own.  A roaring, wordless cry of
15,01pain and relief was released from his gaping mouth as he once again
15,01felt alive.  The warm coloring of man came back into his face as
15,01his first meal in what seemed an eternity found its way into his
15,01body.  It felt wonderful to finally eat, even if it was a rapist
15,01and a murderer.
15,01     Stylus pushed the drained, limp corpse into the icy water and
15,01watched as the hollow body floated out into the lake.  He crushed
15,01the last of his cigarette lazily into the sand with the his scuffed
15,01boot.  The last of the sun was being soaked into the rainbow water
15,01at the horizon, and the dark figure of the man-beast, Stylus, sank
15,01down onto the sand, relaxed and relieved to be free of his hunger
15,01and the burden of choosing his food.

15,01Chapter 2:
15,01     The next day, Stylus awoke, dazed and disoriented, lying in a
15,01smoothed patch of sand, no thoughts in his mind...it was the first
15,01time in months he had slept so well; the first time he had slept
15,01the whole night through without waking in a terrible fit of hunger.

15,01     As the sky grew dark and the streetlights cam on, Stylus
15,01awakened.  Quickly grasping for the ringing alarm, he made contact
15,01and there was silence.  Through the near soundless Chicago night,
15,01a red light and piercing siren flashed by outside his window.
15,01     He dressed quickly, knowing, that if the squad car or
15,01ambulance were on its way to an accident, he may be able to find a
15,01quick snack.  He was a blur as he raced down the stairs and onto
15,01Chicago Avenue.  As he approached the corner, he realized that
15,01something wasn't quite right; someone had just been there, waiting,
15,01and watching for him.  It was at this moment that he felt the blow
15,01and the streetlights above him swirled, and went black.
15,01     When Stylus came to, he was surrounded by silhouttes, moving
15,01about as if in a dance.  Thinking he was had not fully recoverd
15,01from unconciousness, he shook his head and rubbed his eyes, hoping
15,01that the shadows would gain more substance.  His hopes proved
15,01worthless, and the shadows did not gain more substance, they just
15,01continued to dance and occasionally look towards him. Propping
15,01himself up on both elbows, he realized that these were definately
15,01not humans, but, for lack of anything better to call them, they
15,01were "living  shadows".  He yelled -Loudly- for the shadow men to
15,01stop dancing (they were only confusing him and making and their
15,01constant movement was not helping him think either).  Fifteen
15,01featureless, black faces stared back at him.
15,01     Slowly Stylus managed to utter, "W...w...what the hell are
15,01you?  And why am I here?  For that matter, where is here?"  The
15,01last question was not meant to be heard, but came out anyways.
15,01     Apparently in response to his questions, the shadows shrugged
15,01their shoulders in unison and began dancing again, this time it
15,01appeard that there was some meaning to their movements.  After the
15,01third or fourth time through the same movements, Stylus realized
15,01that the creatures were pantamiming his run from the apartment, and
