15,01what i've know is only the beginning,
15,01what i feel has only struck between the lines,
15,01how i live no longer matters,
15,01for i have your love.

15,01you show me your ways,
15,01you take me in to your home,
15,01in return you get nothing back,
15,01and this doesn't even bother you.

15,01i can't go on.
15,01you tears are tearing me apart,
15,01the fire rages inside of me, ticking away at my soul,
15,01waiting to explode in to a non-esistance trap;
15,01trapped beside all that knew no better.

15,01i have no anger,
15,01only my darkness and fear.

15,01i no longer see the light of day,
15,01and all that travels in its crystal path,
15,01of glory.
