15,011.1.97

15,01I listened to you, insulting your infatuation.
15,01She took the lashes like a good little girl, 
15,01your razor-edged tongue lashing into her,
15,01drunken with bloodthirst, laying salt as you went.
15,01And applying the Band-Aid when you were finally sated!
15,01What may I say, but a resigned admission of the way things are?
15,01Cronkite never predicted this...

15,01Oh yes. I observed you, too. Desperate advice-seeker.
15,01(Piggy bank crying out after Ms. Warwick's deductions, presumably?)
15,01I wished your success, and it was done.
15,01The cop had better things to do,
15,01and you escaped home, hand on the stash as you went.
15,01Three cheers for the ball that Woodstock rolled.

15,01I listened to you!
15,01Yes, you -- the "fuck" squad.
15,01Slinging obscenities with abandon.
15,01Beautiful obscenity, beautiful, drunken, sexual obscenity.
15,01So much like myself, but so far apart.
15,01The ball dropped on the proletariat tonight,
15,01one anonymous blow to the lower-class majority, magnified.

15,01I listened to you, the teen meeting her soon-to-be-rapist.
15,01Rapist? Lover? Friend? Anything's sexually correct nowadays.
15,01Boy poses as assassin and rapist, willingly, assailant mostly; all this
15,01for the affections (and hormonal satiety) of beauteous teenage alcoholic,
15,01married at 22, cubicle-ridden for the rest of her life.
15,01Girl yields, as always since she was raped by a stone-age tool. Her
15,01slight protestations are food for a macro-merging with Him. Young
15,01hormones, so faithful, so faithless: racism still reigns in their lives.
15,01But he's no hypocrite; the black people he loves smash glass monthly on
15,01the court.
15,01He's a good boy, loves his mama. She's a good girl, loves her papa.
15,01(Elvis too.)
15,01How will this teenaged meeting end? I am sure: this shall certainly lead
15,01to another meeting (engineered solely, undoubtedly, unwittingly, by the
15,01male), and soon enough, sex.
15,01Plain, simple, sex. She'll allow him to enter with the aid of a condom,
15,01and soon enough, he'll vie for the affections of the next blonde to flash
15,01enough cleavage at him.
15,01See, I'm a member of a vanishing race: the intellectuals. At six years of
15,01age or before, I may have had a chance at premarital sex, when it meant
15,01almost nothing -- just entry and exchange of bodily fluids. Oh! But now,
15,01I am swept along by a tide that raises all boats, except my own, which
15,01has sprung a leak. I sink, sink, sink; now, I have no chance at either
15,01kind, the latter being that rarest kind or teenaged sex, love between
15,01two. Mutuality: swept away by this crimson tide.

15,01Finally, I listened to Them.
15,01Of course you know Them: I shall divulge no more to the virgin mind (Ah!
15,01You idiots are so hard to work with -- much more so than my fellow
15,01intellectuals! but I make my futile attempt all the same, knowing the
15,01irony of my cynicism) than that They cherish their blue cotton.
15,01And so I listened to Them (I repeat this for the benefit of your
15,01overworked synapses).
15,01They watched me recording my dangerous observations! -- They would do
15,01this, and how, I say!
15,01They stalked me, and when They neared to pounce,
15,01I spun around on my position and revealed to them my
15,01ugly
15,01wild
15,01ravaged
15,01passionate
15,01(!dangerous)
15,01countenance. I had watched the Watcher! I guarded the Guardian! I
15,01controlled the Controller!

15,01As usual, They remained unfettered. An individual visage emerged from
15,01Them, then a hand, and the hand rose from the mire and shot me in the
15,01face at the height of its apex'd arc.
