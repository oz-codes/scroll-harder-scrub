11,01Invading ou10r world
11,01Betraying o10ur rights
11,01And yet we 10still lay in 14the dark
11,01Lying and w10ondering

11,01Lighting up 10the midnite 14skies
11,01Why so shy 10and ever so 14strange
11,01Hovering ab10ove, and doi14ng what?
11,01We lie and 10wonder

11,01Who are the10se beings?
11,01Why are you 10unknown to 14us?
11,01Yet you fee10l free to po14ke and probe
11,01As we lie a10nd wonder

11,01Where are y10ou from
11,01We have so 10many questio14ns
11,01Why don't y10ou help
11,01All we can 10do is lie an14d wonder

11,01Lying benea10th the night 14struck sky
11,01Looking at 10those distan14t stars
11,01Are those y10our homes?
11,01Or are they 10your ships?

11,01Our curiosi10ty has been 14spoken
11,01Yet the one10s we trust h14ave betrayed us
11,01Can we trus10t you to ans14wer
11,01These unans10wered questi14ons?  How can we?

11,01So many que10stions go un14answered
11,01Speculation10s and concer14ns
11,01Cover up an10d deciet
11,01Our own gov10ernment cann14ot
11,01Will not re10veal
11,01your true i10dentity

11,01And all we 10can do as we 14look up
11,01With no rea10l answers at 14hand
11,01Is think of 10who you are 14what you are
11,01And think..10.think about 14the unknown
