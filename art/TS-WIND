03,01The wind blows silently
03,01Forever without making a sound
03,01It moves only the slightest bit
03,01Reminding me that I will not see you again

03,01You're gone, for a long time now
03,01Yet I never could say goodbye
03,01The wind keeps on churning
03,01Not disturbing a soul

03,01You're not here anymore
03,01And I guess you don't bother anyone
03,01One day I'll be able to do it
03,01Untill then, forever, goodbye...
