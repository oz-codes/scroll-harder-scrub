15,01        The drab grey wallpaper began to drip and curl.  This time, it was 
15,01not a leaky pipe that was slowly staining the once-red wallpaper into the 
15,01dismal grey shade that it had become.  In fact, it was not just the 
15,01wallpaper that was curling this time.  It was the whole wall.  The wall 
15,01began to peel downwards, drops of old pipe-water slowly running out of 
15,01cracks and dripping rhythmically onto Jason Peter's head.  He 
15,01absent-mindedly dragged his bleary gaze upward, making a mental note that 
15,01something was not quite right.  Unfortunately, the pathetic Rolodex of his 
15,01mind feebly gripped the note, then wheezed and lost it.  The mental note 
15,01drifted into his lukewarm consciousness and drowned.

15,01        It was actually quite tragic that Jason Peter had such a feeble 
15,01mind.  For this time, the wall was tired of the laeky pipes and tired of its 
15,01once-red wallpaper being stained and ruined.  The entire wall curled 
15,01downward like a wave and crushed him quite gruesomely.  Then, amazingly, it 
15,01began to unfurl and roll back upwards until at last it was joined to the 
15,01ceiling once more.  The wall, satisfied with its new coat of red, did not 
15,01move again.  It simply waited for the next unfortunate person who would move 
15,01in and let the pipes continue to leak.  The pipes had been leaking for years 
15,01now, since the ominous wall had not let anyone live long enough to fix them.
