15,01 Ugh
15,01 ---

15,01 There was a time
15,01 when I didn't write sappy
15,01 love-crap bullshit poetry.
15,01 I wonder what happened to that guy,
15,01 he seemed like such a nice fellow.
15,01 Too bad he had to leave in a hurry like that.

15,01 Back in the day, I was a GUY.
15,01 None of this "let me count the ways" garbage
15,01 that teenagers fill endless journals with.
15,01 And yet, here I am.  25 going on 14.
15,01 This feels so wrong.
