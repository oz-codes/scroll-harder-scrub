15,01                        00Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
15,01                     00I cannot reach you, you are too far.
15,01                       00How you tease me with your light,
15,01                       00You are too much, I cannot fight.

15,01                       00I dream to have you in my hand,
15,01                        00We will dance across the land.
15,01                     00We will dance all through the night,
15,01                      00You will provide me with my light.

15,01                           00In the day I miss you so,
15,01                     00You know I love you, I know you know.
15,01                       00We cannot dance, we are too far,
15,01                      00You are my light, you are my star.
