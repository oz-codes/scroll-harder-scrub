15,01They're yelling. Are they laughing at me?
15,01They're shooting. Are they shooting at me?
15,01They're spying. Are they spying on me?
15,01Chained to the wall, I can't get free.
15,01Longing to leave, but now they own me.
15,01Stuck all alone, shivering in my cell.
15,01Nothing could be worse than being stuck
15,01in this hell.
15,01Trapped, abused, ignored and alone.
15,01Yelling and crying, I scream and moan.
15,01They won't let me out, the won't let me
15,01be. I'm stuck in this prison
15,01I can't get free.
