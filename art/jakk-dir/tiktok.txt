 Wake up in the morning feeling like [nig]Nigga (Hey, what up [nig]?) 
 got my gat- on IRC - I'm gonna hit this trigga (Let's roll) 
 Before I leave, smoke some weed with my homie Jakk 
 Makin it big on the streets, cause we be sellin crack!
 
 I'm talking - pimpin' with the hoes, hoes 
 Drive by's on our foes, foes 
 [nig]s blowing up our phones, phones 
 Big poppin, trolling our favorite IRCs
 3am parties 
 Eatin' that chicken that's cripsy 
 
 [CHORUS] 
 Don't stop, make it hot 
 [nig]s, blow my block up 
 Tonight, I'mma fight 
 'Til we see the daylight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the wreckin' don't stop 
 
 No- Oh- ooh- oh oh oh 
 Oh- ooh- oh oh oh 
 
 Don't stop, make it hot 
 [nig]s, blow my block up 
 Tonight, I'mma fight 
 'Til we see the daylight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the wreckin' don't stop 
 
 No- Oh- ooh- oh oh oh 
 Oh- ooh- oh oh oh 
 
 Ain't got a care in world, but got plenty of 40's 
 Ain't got no money in my pocket, but I'm mackin' them shawties 
 And Now, the hoes are lining up cause they hear we got swagger 
 But we kick 'em in the teeth cause opers are teabaggers
 I'm talking about - errbody getting crunk, crunk 
 Bitches tryin ta steal our funk, funk 
 Gonna drop him if he getting too drunk, drunk 
 Now, now - we goin' til they gline us, us 
 Or the opers make a fuss, fuss 
 Haters tryin ta shut us down, down 
 Opers trying ta shut us - 
 
 Don't stop, make it hot 
 [nig]s, blow my block up 
 Tonight, I'mma fight 
 'Til we see the daylight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the wreckin' don't stop
 
 No- Oh- ooh- oh oh oh 
 Oh- ooh- oh oh oh Oh 
 
 Don't stop, make it hot 
 [nig]s, blow my block up 
 Tonight, I'mma fight 
 'Til we see the daylight 
 Tick tock, on the clock 
 But the wreckin' don't stop
 
 No- Oh- ooh- oh oh oh
