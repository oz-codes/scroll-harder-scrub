Well I'm not a tech guy... I just buy what the tech guys tell me to buy. When it comes to buying equipment, all I do is write the checks and buy what I'm told to buy. I guess Nate didn't think a backup would be necessary or something, and since I know nothing about that type of thing, I couldn't second-guess him. All I do is write the checks.
