STUFF TO DO WHEN YOU AREN'T HAX0RING, CYBERING OR SEKS0RING TO IMPROVE YOUR 
IMAGE AS A K-RAD HAX0R.


$- CHANT UNIX COMMANDS WHEN YOUR IN PUBLIC ( CROWDED BUSSES, THE RECORD 
STORE AND BARS ARE ALL PERFECT) THIS WILL NOT ONLY GIVE IMPRESSION OF HOW 
LEET YOU TRULY ARE BUT IT WILL ALSO MAKE YOU THE MOST PH33R3D KID ON THE 
BLOCK.

$- BUY A ROOTSHELL CAPS. BUY WELL KNOW HAX0RING FEATURED CLOTHES ;
CdC, L0PHT, DEFCON, R00TFEST, FREE KEVIN, FUCK JP, ETC
IF YOU CANT AFFORD TO BUY LEET CLOTHES LIKE THESE YOU CAN ALWAYS MAKE YOUR 
OWN. GO WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

		- PH33R ¤!%"#%¤
		- I CRACKED WHITEHOUSE.GOV
		- ZYKLON WAS MY CELLMATE, I R00TED HIM
		- TIMUTSHU IS A WANKER

$- GET A BINARY TATTOO

$- GO TO A PAINT STORE AND ASK FOR A BOX OF "#C0C0C0"
USE THE PAINT TO PAINT 0'S AND 1'S ON EACH WALL IN YOUR HOUSE (R00M IF YOU 
LIVE WITH YOUR MOM AND/OR DAD).

$- MAKE A K-RAD SITE WHERE YOU POST ALL YOUR EXPLOITS, A LIST OF ALL YOUR 
HACKS, A LIST OF WHO'S NEXT !"#@¤, A SHOUTOUT SECTION TO ALL THE GROUPS AND 
NAMES YOU EVER READ ABOUT IN HNN, A FUCK 0FF SECTION TO ALL THE GROUPS AND 
NAMES YOU EVER READ ABOUT IN HNN

$- PERFECTIONIZE THE ART OF LAUGHING "HEH" IN REAL LIFE.

$- ENCRYPT EVERY HANDWRITTEN PIECE OF PAPER YOU MAKE, EVEN SCRIBBLES, AND 
BURN THE ORIGINALS.

$- IF SOMEONE IS IGNORANT ENOUGH TO MAKE FUN OF YOU, PICK ON YOU, HARASS 
YOU, BEAT YOU, KICK YOU IN THE MACS, TELL MOMMY JOKES ABOUT YOUR MOM, OR DO 
ANYTHING AT ALL THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED CRUEL AND MEAN, JUST LAUGH "HEH" AND 
CHANT UNIX COMMANDS TILL THEY STOP AND LEAVE

$- MAKE FUN OF THE CASHIER ( NOT RECOMMENDED IF SHE'S A CHIX0R, UNLESS YOUR 
GAY OF COURSE ), IF ITS A DUDE OR A HIGH SCHOOL BULLY DROPOUT THAT'S EVEN 
BETTER. SAY MEAN THINGS LIKE : 

	- OH MAN YOUR TYPING IS SLOW 
	- HAVEN'T I CYBERED YOU SOMETIME?
	- AREN'T YOU ONE OF THE GUYS FROM VILLAGE PEOPLE? 
	- I COULD R00T YOUR STORES LAME NETWORK IN 6 SEC's USING NOTHING BUT 
	NETSTAT
	- YOU MAKE JP SEEM LEET
	- WHAT'S THAT PERFUME YOUR WEARING, "CAROLYN MEINEL "? (YOU HAVE TO BE 
	PRETTY LEET TO UNDERSTAND THIS ONE)

HeLLo AnArChisTs, i h0Pe y0U enJ0y mUhH TeXt PhiLe. k0mMentZZ and 
SugGesti0nZZZ g0 t0 U-Haul@writeme.com.  Sorry about everything being 
aligned in a screwed up way. 


The Three Types of Averages are:

mean (most often referred to as "the average")
median
mode


The mean is the sum of a set of numbers divided by the number of items 
(numbers) in that set.

The median is the middle value in a set of data.

The mode is the data item that occurs most often.


Mean Example :

Miss Sculco gave a math test for her small class.  The scores of the test 
were 25, 85, 100, 95, 75.  Find the mean average.

Set of numbers = {25, 85, 100, 95, 75}

The sum of the set = 25+85+100+95+75 = 380

The number of items = 5

Mean average = sum of the set divided by the number of items = 380 divided 
by 5 = 76

Mean average = 76

The mean average of the scores of Miss Sculco's test was 76.

Median Example:

Miss Sculco wanted to find the median shoe size for the students in her 
class.  The sizes were 8, 7, 4, 6, 7, 10, 9, 13, and 7.  Find the median.

set of data = {8, 7, 4, 6, 7, 10, 9, 13, 7}

Median\middle value in a set of data.  to find it, put the numbers in order 
from greatest to least.

4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13

Now, just find the number in the middle of the set of numbers.

median = 7

Mode Example:

Miss Sculco wanted to find the mode shoe size for the students in her class.  
Refer to the above problem for the shoe sizes.  What is the mode?

Mode = data item that occurs most often.

7 occurs most often in the above set of numbers.  therefore, 7 is the mode 
shoe size.  (All the other numbers only appeared once, and 7 appeared three 
times)

It's All About The Pentiums

It's all about the Pentiums, baby
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
Uhh, uh-huh, yeah
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
It's all about the Pentiums, baby
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
(Yeah!!)

What y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?  Code crackers?  Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
Workin' at a desk with a dumb little placard?
Yeah, payin' the bills with my mad programming skills
Defraggin' my hard drive for thrills
I got me a hundred gigabytes of RAM
I never feed trolls and I don't read spam
Installed a T1 line in my house
Always at my PC, double-clickin' on my mizouse
Upgrade my system at least twice a day
I'm strictly plug-and-play, I ain't afraid of Y2K
I'm down with Bill Gates, I call him Money for short
I phone him up at home and I make him do my tech support
It's all about the Pentiums, what?
You gotta be the dumbest newbie I've ever seen
You've got white-out all over your screen
You think your Commodore 64 is really neato
What kinda chip you got in there, a Dorito?
You're usin' a 286?  Don't make me laugh
Your Windows boots up in what, a day and a half?
You could back up your whole hard drive on a floppy diskette
You're the biggest joke on the Internet
Your database is a disaster
You're waxin' your modem, tryin' to make it go faster
Hey fella, I bet you're still livin' in your parents' cellar
Downloadin' pictures of Sarah Michelle Gellar
And postin' "Me too!" like some brain-dead AOL-er
I should do the world a favor and cap you like Old Yeller
You're just about as useless as jpegs to Helen Keller

It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!

What y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?  Code crackers?  Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?

Uh, uh, loggin' in now
Wanna run wit my crew, hah?
Rule cyberspace and crunch numbers like I do?
They call me the king of the spreadsheets
Got'em all printed out on my bedsheets
My new computer's got the clocks, it rocks
But it was obsolete before I opened the box
You say you've had your desktop for over a week?
Throw that junk away, man, it's an antique!

Your laptop is a month old?  Well, that's great
If you could use a nice, heavy paperweight
My digital media is write-protected
Every file inspected, no viruses detected
I beta tested every operating system
Gave props to some, and others?  I dissed'em
While your computer's crashin', mine's multitaskin'
It does all my work without me even askin'
Got a flat-screen monitor, 40" wide
I believe that yours says, "Etch-A-Sketch" on the side
In a 32-bit world, you're a 2-bit user
You've got your own newsgroup, alt.total-loser
Your motherboard melts when you try to send a fax
Where'd you get your CPU, in a box of Cracker Jacks?
Play me online?  Well, you know that I'll beat you
If I ever meet you I'll control-alt-delete you
What?

It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!
It's all about the Pentiums!

What y'all wanna do?
Wanna be hackers?  Code crackers?  Slackers
Wastin' time with all the chatroom yakkers?
9 to 5, chillin' at Hewlett Packard?
What?

SuRgE wakes up one morning, and while still bleary-eyed, goes to pee. He 
suddenly realizes that his dick is bright orange. He hops in the shower, and 
rubs and scrubs, but it is still bright orange. "Well," he thinks to himself 
"it doesn't hurt, and I don't feel sick, may as well go to work." A few 
hours later at work, he has to pee again. While standing in the employees 
restroom at a urinal, one of his co-workers happens to look over and see the 
orange appendage. "Your dick is orange!" the co-worker exclaims. To which 
SuRgE says "I know. It was like that when I woke up." "If I were you" says 
the co-worker, "I'd go see the company doctor right away." Taking his 
advice, SuRgE goes to the doctor. After several tests, the doctor says "It's 
orange alright! There is no medical reason that it should be. Did you do 
anything unusual this weekend?" "Nope" SuRgE says.
"I just sat around the whole weekend, watching porno’s, and eating Cheetos."

<Rapture> to start with
<Rapture> are you ereet?
<k-rad-bob> okay
<k-rad-bob> yes
<k-rad-bob> but only to some degree
<Rapture> do you lead b0g?
<k-rad-bob> not really, i founded it and came up with the whole concept, so 
i guess its only natural to look at me as some sort of leader
<k-rad-bob> so like yes
<Rapture> who are current members of b0g?
<k-rad-bob> heh
<k-rad-bob> right now its like me,prae,bio,shr0t,prae,you,tress,n twist

<Rapture> so quite a few
<k-rad-bob> yes :)
<Rapture> does b0g condone the acts of its homosexual member prae ?
<k-rad-bob> well we are a bunch of unique and open minded individuals
<k-rad-bob> we're not too happy about it but thats his way of life
<Rapture> what does b0g think of the homosexual anal fiend evilflow?
<k-rad-bob> r0bberz is a pretty weird kid
<Rapture> define weird
<k-rad-bob> he has some skills but he never gets to establish himself
<k-rad-bob> well you never know where you have him
<k-rad-bob> and he doesnt really let anyone know who he really is
<k-rad-bob> and he can be an total asshole at times :)
<Rapture> ok
<Rapture> will b0g be defacing any websites?
<k-rad-bob> eventually im sure thats bound to happen

<k-rad-bob> besides www.hampsterdance.com i would have to say www.l0pht.com
<Rapture> does b0g have plans for world domination? 
<k-rad-bob> yes
<k-rad-bob> but thats confidential
<Rapture> will there be any b0g sluts for the members to fuck senseless?
<k-rad-bob> it better!
<k-rad-bob> right now we only have prae though
<Rapture> will there be a b0g website in the near future?
<k-rad-bob> definitely
<k-rad-bob> and run a spell check when your done ;)

<Rapture> welcome to b0g
<Niquette> thank you, glad to be here

the people in #k-rad ?
<Niquette> well, bob invited me a long time ago, and i got addicted to it i 
guess. Besides the people of k-rad are harmless.. well except for bob and 
his notepad ;)
<Rapture> how about the raving homosexual prae ?
<Rapture> you dont think him and his 2" cock are dangerous?
<Niquette> not really. Prae is usually nice, but i think he is hitting 
puberty right now. 
<Rapture> so will you be reading the b0g newsletter
<Niquette> that would explain the horniness and fowl stenches
<Niquette> yea probably
<Niquette> i just asked bob if i could put an article in it

<SuRgE> Hello, Amy. What do you look like?
<amy14> I am wearing a red silk blouse, a miniskirt and high 
heels. I work out every day, I'm toned and perfect. My measurements are
36-24-36. What do you look like?
<SuRgE> I'm 6'3" and about 250 pounds. I wear glasses and I have on a
pair of blue sweat pants I just bought from WalMart. I'm also wearing a
T-shirt with a few spots of barbecue sauce on it from dinner...it 
smells funny.
<amy14> I want you. Would you like to screw me?
<SuRgE> OK
<amy14> We're in my bedroom. There's soft music playing on the
stereo and candles on my dresser and night table. I'm looking up into
your eyes, smiling. My hand works its way down to your crotch and
begins to fondle your huge, swelling bulge.
<SuRgE> I'm gulping, I'm beginning to sweat.
<amy14> I'm pulling up your shirt and kissing your chest.
<SuRgE> Now I'm unbuttoning your blouse. My hands are trembling.
<amy14> I'm moaning softly.
<SuRgE> I'm taking hold of your blouse and sliding it off slowly.
<amy14> I'm throwing my head back in pleasure. The cool silk
slides off my warm skin. I'm rubbing your bulge faster, pulling and 
rubbing.
<SuRgE> My hand suddenly jerks spastically and accidentally rips a
hole in your blouse. I'm sorry.
<amy14> That's OK, it wasn't really too expensive.
<SuRgE> I'll pay for it.
<amy14> Don't worry about it. I'm wearing a lacy black bra. My 
soft breasts are rising and falling, as I breath harder and harder.
<SuRgE> I'm fumbling with the clasp on your bra. I think it's stuck
Do you have any scissors?
<amy14> I take your hand and kiss it softly. I'm reaching back
undoing the clasp. The bra slides off my body. The air caresses my
breasts. My nipples are erect for you.
<SuRgE> How did you do that? I'm picking up the bra and inspecting
the clasp.
<amy14> I'm arching my back. Oh baby. I just want to feel your
tongue all over me.
<SuRgE> I'm dropping the bra. Now I'm licking your, you know,
breasts. They're neat!
<amy14> I'm running my fingers through your hair. Now I'm 
nibbling your ear.
<SuRgE> I suddenly sneeze. Your breasts are covered with spit and
phlegm.
<amy14> What?
<SuRgE> I'm so sorry. Really.
<amy14> I'm wiping your phlegm off my breasts with the remains of
my blouse.
<SuRgE> I'm taking the sopping wet blouse from you. I drop it with a 
plop.
<amy14> OK. I'm pulling your sweat pants down and rubbing your
hard tool.
<SuRgE> I'm screaming like a woman. Your hands are cold! Yeeee!
<amy14> I'm pulling up my miniskirt. Take off my panties.
<SuRgE> I'm pulling off your panties. My tongue is going all over,
in and out nibbling on you...umm... wait a minute.
<amy14> What's the matter?
<SuRgE> I've got a pubic hair caught in my throat. I'm choking.
<amy14> Are you OK?
<SuRgE> I'm having a coughing fit. I'm turning all red.
<amy14> Can I help?
<SuRgE> I'm running to the kitchen, choking wildly. I'm fumbling
through the cabinets, looking for a cup. Where do you keep your cups?
<amy14> In the cabinet to the right of the sink.
<SuRgE> I'm drinking a cup of water. there, that's better.
<amy14> Come back to me, lover.
<SuRgE> I'm washing the cup now.
<amy14> I'm on the bed arching for you.
<SuRgE> I'm drying the cup. Now I'm putting it back in the cabinet.
And now I'm walking back to the bedroom. Wait, it's dark, I'm lost.
Where's the bedroom?
<amy14> Last door on the left at the end of the hall.
<SuRgE> I found it.
<amy14> I'm tugging' off your pants. I'm moaning. I want you so 
badly.
<SuRgE> Me too.
<amy14> Your pants are off. I kiss you passionately-our naked
bodies pressing each other.
<SuRgE> Your face is pushing my glasses into my face. It hurts.
<amy14> Why don't you take off your glasses?
<SuRgE> OK, but I can't see very well without them. I place the
glasses on the night table.
<amy14> I'm bending over the bed. Give it to me, baby!
<SuRgE> I have to pee. I'm fumbling my way blindly across the room
and toward the bathroom.
<amy14> Hurry back, lover.
<SuRgE> I find the bathroom and it's dark. I'm feeling around for
the toilet. I lift the lid.
<amy14> I'm waiting eagerly for your return.
<SuRgE> I'm done going. I'm feeling around for the flush handle, 
but I can't find it. Uh-oh!
<amy14> What's the matter now?
<SuRgE> I've realized that I've peed into your laundry hamper. 
Sorry again. I'm walking back to the bedroom now, blindly feeling my 
way.
<amy14> Mmm, yes. Come on.
<SuRgE> OK, now I'm going to put my...you know ...thing...in
your...you know...woman's thing.
<amy14> Yes! Do it, baby! Do it!
<SuRgE> I'm touching your smooth butt. It feels so nice. I kiss
your neck. Umm, I'm having a little trouble here.
<amy14> I'm moving my ass back and forth, moaning. I can't stand
it another second! Slide in! Screw me now!
<SuRgE> I'm flaccid.
<amy14> What?
<SuRgE> I'm limp. I can't sustain an erection.
<amy14> I'm standing up and turning around; an incredulous look 
on my face.
<SuRgE> I'm shrugging with a sad look on my face, my wiener all
floppy. I'm going to get my glasses and see what's wrong.
<amy14> No, never mind. I'm getting dressed. I'm putting on my
underwear. Now I'm putting on my wet nasty blouse.
<SuRgE> No wait! Now I'm squinting, trying to find the night 
table. I'm feeling along the dresser, knocking over cans of hair spray, 
picture frames and your candles.
<amy14> I'm buttoning my blouse. Now I'm putting on my shoes.
<SuRgE> I've found my glasses. I'm putting them on. My God! One 
of our candles fell on the curtain. The curtain is on fire! I'm 
pointing at it, a shocked look on my face.
<amy14> Go to hell. I'm logging off, you loser!
<SuRgE> Now the carpet is on fire! Oh noooo!

	Do you ever need a simple program and you dont want to fumble with a 
complex programming 
language like C to make it? Need something Quick, easy to make, and works 
efficient? Believe it or
not, if you have MS-DOS (not the version that comes with Windows), then you 
also have a very 
powerful, yet simple programming tool called QBASIC. The version of QB you 
get with DOS is not 
the compiler version, so you cannot make executables with it, but there is a 
way around this i 
will explain in a little bit.

First thing you need to do is open the MS-DOS prompt from windows, type: 
qbasic then hit enter.
If you have used MS-Edit before than you will notice it looks almost exactly 
like it, and it 
should be somewhat easier to figure out. A window will pop up when you first 
enter the program, 
hit escape to close this window. now you will have an untitled file just 
waiting for your 
fingertips to fill it up. Lets start by writing the forever popular Hello 
World! program.

1
CLS 
PRINT "Hello World!"
END

Now try running the program by hitting Alt, R, then Enter. If you did not 
make any typos it will 
run the program and you will see a blank screen with 'Hello World!' at the 
top and 'Press Any Key
To Continue' at the bottom. 

How it worked:

1                     (The line number, not really needed in QBASIC unless 
you use GOTO commands)
CLS                   (Clears the screen of any text or graphics)
PRINT "Hello World!"  (Prints any text encircled by the "s)
END                   (Tells the computer that this is the end of the 
program)

Now lets go a little more in-depth with some more powerful commands.

1
CLS
INPUT "What is your name"; name$
CLS
PRINT "Hello"; name$ 
END

Now if you run this program you will first be prompted a question, 'What is 
your name?', you can
type in anything you want here (it cannot go over a certain amount of 
characters, but i forgot 
how many). Next when you press enter it will say 'Hello Joe Lamer' (or 
whatever you said your 
name was), then it will end. 

How it worked:

First I must point out the this --->    name$ 
What is this you ask? It is called a variable, a variable in algebra is a 
number with no given 
value, in QBASIC it is the same thing, only it can be letters also. it can 
also be called 
anything you like it to be called as long as it does not go over 30 
characters (I think) and that
it has a $ at the end of it. Example:  stupidnameforavariable$

1
CLS
INPUT "What is your name"; name$  (Asks for input and assigns the input to 
the variable)
CLS 
PRINT "Hello"; name$              (says 'Hello' and also prints the 
variable)
END

Now your thinking, this is cool, but I have to open this QBASIC program to 
run the programs, I 
sure as hell don't want to do that. Well guess what, there is a way around 
this, all you have to
do is this:

1. open a text editor program and write the following:

@qbasic /run programname.bas

2. Save this as programname.bat (programname is whatever you named your 
program, duh).
3. put the file in the same directory you saved your program

What you just did is simple, you made a file called a batch file. Batch 
files run a series of
commands that you dont want to type over and over again at the DOS prompt. 
One example is
autoexec.bat in your C:\ directory. This batch file is run every time you 
start your computer to
set up sound cards, video cards, start windows, run virus scan, etc. If you 
wanted to, you could
put the above commands at the bottom of your autoexec.bat so every time you 
start your computer 
it runs that program. If your really good at ASCII art you could make a QB 
program to print out
a kewl logo every time you started up your PC. Or.... you could even make 
your PC password 
protected at startup like this:

1
CLS
INPUT "Please enter your password now ", passwd$
IF passwd$ = "yourpasswordgoeshere" THEN GOTO 2
CLS 
PRINT "INCORRECT PASSWORD!!! Please try again."
SLEEP 1
GOTO 1
2
END

Note: This program would be easy to bypass if you forgot your password, all 
you would have to do
is restart your computer then hold shift as soon as you see it say 'Sarting 
MS-DOS'. You would
keep your hand on the shift key until you see the "C:\>" come up, then let 
go. The shift key 
tells the computer not to load the autoexec.bat or config.sys file. You 
would have access to the 
computer but might not be able to start windows because of drivers not being 
loaded. Then you 
could open up your program and change the password and reset the PC. Now 
your thinking, so what 
good is this program if somebody can just hold the shift key? Believe it or 
not, most people are 
not too smart when it comes to DOS, in fact, I know people who are actually 
afraid of it. So you
could easily keep your little brother or sister of your computer, but if you 
invited a hacker 
over to get through your password, he would laugh at you.

How it worked:

1
CLS
INPUT "Please enter your password now ", passwd$
IF passwd$ = "yourpasswordgoeshere" THEN GOTO 2   (this compares the 
variable with the password,
CLS                                                if it is correct it will 
go to line 2, if not
PRINT "INCORRECT PASSWORD!!! Please try again."    it will just continue the 
program)
SLEEP 1                                           (This tells the PC to wait 
one sec, then go on)
GOTO 1                                            (This tells the PC to go 
to line 1)
2
END

Don't be afraid to play with the programs a little bit, none of the commands 
i included here can 
damage your computer. What you just learned is only the tip of the iceberg, 
QBASIC can do much
much more than just this simple crap. You can do graphics and sounds with 
QBASIC, and complex 
math functions. If you enjoyed programming in this language, then I suggest 
you get a copy of
QBASIC for Dummies, the printing company is called IDG. The book is very  
easy to follow, and 
gives a better understanding of QBASIC. Hope you enjoyed this article.

How to get Banned from a Channel in IRC (Part 1)                  

   I like to think of getting Banned as an Art I hope you will someday
   too...

   First you must join a channel, (e.g. /join #gaydogsex).
   Then you should get something like this:-
   
   [20:56] *** Now talking in #gaydogsex
   [20:56] *** Topic is '<¡¡¡¡NO PICS OR TRADING!!!!>  Dobermans and
   other breeds and the guys who love them deep inside'...
   WWW.DogSex.Org'
   [20:56] *** Set by Woof on Tue Jan 11 18:41:25
   
   Simple, huh?

   Then you need to look at the Ops (Channel Operators).

         
   Operators in #gaydogsex -

   @NyDog 
   @BaltDog

   @Woof   
  
   Now I have picked my victim (Woof) and I'm ready to get banned,
   There are a few ways to get banned the one I'm showing you is
   calLed:- 
   'Abusing The Ops'
   
   So what do we do now? Okay, now we think of something funny yet
   insulting to say to our victim... 
   (WE DONT WANT TO GET BANNED RIGHT AWAY!)

   For example: 
 
   [21:11] <Prae2k> Woof, How does it feel to have a big ol' Dog dick
   in your ass?
   [21:12] <Woof> it feels great :-)
   [21:12] <Prae2k> Did you ever get your asshole torn?
   [21:12] <Woof> nope
   [21:12] <Prae2k> You're pretty lucky then
   [21:13] <Woof> well in 22 years of being fucked by dogs i never have

   Note: I was making fun of him, but not in an explicit way..

   
   Now we shall move on to more advanced stuff!

   Being an expert at getting banned I know what the Ops do and don't
   like...

   Five things they do not like:-

   1, They don't like you questioning their autority!

    Example:

    <Prae2k> Why the fuck do you hitlist people!?
    <Prae2k> that is soooooo fucking gay!!!
    <Prae2k> Woof I think you're just a big useless fag!
    *** You were kicked from #gaydogsex by Woof (Shut Up.)

    #gaydogsex unable to rejoin channel (you're banned!)
 
  I mean shit.. That was soo easy. Let's move on to something more fun!
   
    2, They hate you spamming shit like an AOL'er

     Example: 

     [21:30] <Prae2k> NOWAY MY BROTHER IS STEVEN TYLURZ MOM AND HE SEZ
     THAT IT WUZ ALL HIS DOING FOR THAT GAME AND SO I MUST BE
     RITE AND SO YOU JUST ALL SUCK DICK ASS FAG CLIT SAQ!
     [21:30] <Prae2k> WHUT THA FUCK R J00 SHITTING, NIGGR0X?
     [21:30] <Prae2k> I WNET TO JAHMEKKUH FOR VAYCAYSHUN ONEC AND DAY
     SED HEY MON AND SO I WUZ LIKE FUQSAQ J0UR
     ASSCLITSAX RASTANBOOEYZ!!! DEN DEY PUT MUHAYAZZ
     BACK ON DE PLAYNE HOME...
     [21:30] <Prae2k> DONT TELL ME THAT CUZ WHEN I WUZ YOUNGRR THEY
     TRIED TO KILL ME TOO AND IT HURTZ WHEN YOU TALK
     LIKE THAT

     [21:31] *** You were kicked from #gaydogsex by Woof (Join #AOL !!)

     #gaydogsex unable to rejoin channel (you're banned!)

     
     h0h0h!!!! I 0wned!


    3, They hate you /msg'ing them with gay shit

      Example:

      [21:41] -> *Woof* I want to fuck you in the ass, soooooo badly!!!
      [21:41] *Woof* your a sick fuck

      [21:31] *** You were kicked from #gaydogsex by Woof (your sick!)

      #gaydogsex unable to rejoin channel (you're banned!)

 
      Easy!


     4, I like to scare/disgust the normal users...

      Example: 

      [21:44] <Prae2k> I like to lick my cats asshole! 
      [21:44] <GrumDMY> eww..
      [21:44] <Prae2k> Slowly probing its stinky sphincter.
      [21:44] * GrumDMY barfs
      [21:44] <Prae2k> haha

      [21:31] *** You were kicked from #gaydogsex by Woof (Stay out!)

      #gaydogsex unable to rejoin channel (you're banned!)

      
      All in a days work!


     5, Lets use a ping flood!!!!!

      Example:

      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING

      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING
      -> [Woof] PING

      [21:31] *** You were kicked from #gaydogsex by Woof (lamer)

Requirements:

- Escalator
- A handful of coins (no coins smaller than a nickel, use nickels and 
quarters if possible)


This text shows you how to damage an escalator.

Instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Go to a clothing store, or any store with an escalator. Go to the 
escalator, 
turn your head to the right, do you see any security guards or store 
officials? If yes,
pretend you're looking at something the store is selling. If no, turn your 
head to the left, do you see any
security guards or store officials? If yes, pretend you're looking at 
something the store is
selling. If no then we'll have some fun.

	Are you following me? Do you understand? Good, go on the escalator, 
take out all
your coins, put as many as you can in the cracks of the escalator. Oh, one 
more thing, make
sure that nobody is on the escalator, or you're in trouble. Try putting a 
coin in each of
the cracks. It should look something like this:

|      |      |      |      |      |      |
| coin | coin | coin | coin | coin | etc  |
| crk1 | crk2 | crk3 | crk4 | crk5 | etc  |
|      |      |      |      |      |      |

	Now put your left foot forward then your right foot, and then repeat 
this process
5 times, it's called walking, you would find that very useful in your 
anarchy career. Next,
put your right foot behind your left foot if you're a righty, and do the 
opposite if you're
a lefty, now turn your body in a clockwise motion 180 degrees (half a turn). 
Now position
your pupils so that they're pointing towards and focused at the coins on the 
escalator.

	When the coins reach the top or bottom, it will bounce, only some will 
go in and
ruin the escalator. The ones that fall out? I think you will know what to 
do.  You've
acquired the required anarchy skills from this text to figure out what to 
do.

	After you hear the loud noise with your ears, walk (I taught you how 
to do that
above) away only much quicker.


Conclusion:

I hope you learned a lot from this text. This little trick was discovered by 
me, Camo. Take
credit for this an you die.


Remember, I'm not responsible for what you do with this. Happy escalating'!

I am smiling a complacent smile as I look out through the pathetic curtains,
out of the window, out at her. She has her back turned against me where she
stands, talking to Annie, a girl that has never even glanced at me or - god
forbid - talked to me; but there is a great possibility that she have talked
about me.
   "He's so godfuckin' strange", I imagine her saying, with her usual
I-am-god's-gift-to-man-as-well-as-the-whole-fucking-humanity-look that is
known as her trademark. Then she would make a funny face just to show how
much she means it, before continuing with something like "He's always
looking at me. Gives me the creeps."
   Annie is one of those ladies that are so out-of-this-world fuckable and
perfect - when it comes to looks, at least - that no one even dares to try.
She must be artificial, probably coming from a galaxy at the other side of
the Milky Way, or perhaps another dimension - maybe she is just an illusion.
An unexplained phenomenon created out of occasional events in nature and
science's chaotic existence. She scares me, forces me away, banishes me to a
land of shadow beyond the sun at the other side of the moon. I never quite
reach a full orgasm when I summon the picture - the manipulated image of her
that only exists in the wildest of my fantasies: She's naked, vulgar,
nothing but a cheap hooker, and I take her by force. I rush over her like
some kind of animal - summon her picture inside me and leaves my body to
attend itself. She screams, whines, and her long fingernails creates small
red paths all over me. When I reach climax the image disappears in flash of
a moment and I feel empty. All pleasure vanish and I feel dirty, ashamed.
   Annie pretends that she does not see me. But I know she does, because all
of a sudden she appears nervous. I bet she is sweating, that her hands are
locked into each other behind her back like two small white knots. Then she
suddenly turns against me, looking straight at me and I turn away my face so
hard and violently that I almost snap my neck. I can feel my eyeballs
banging into my skull before finding rest in their favorite position -
focused yet not focused at anything specific. My mind and body implode. I
curse myself for making it so clear, so obvious that I am afraid of her. She
knows I am in her power, and she is enjoying every moment of it even if she
is not showing it. I hate her. I am confused. Go away, get lost! my mind
yells until she finally leaves.
   Rachel is left behind, standing there all alone. She turns, giving me a
smile when she sees me, then walks toward the door. Inside she buys a soft
drink and she sucks in the stream of juice between her lips as she sits down
right in front of me.
   "Hi."
   She says, smiling.
   I hate her too. I love her for what she can make me feel and I hate her
for what she can do to me. "Go to hell" she could say, crushing my heart in
her hands and then tear it apart right before my eyes. I am powerless and
afraid. I do not have control; I rush through my life, I try to satisfy
myself and I try hard to avoid getting hurt. I really want the alien being
that is me to have such a good time as possible. I dream about material
benefits and fear emotions.
   Rachel is still smiling. She has a wonderful smile and I wish that I too
could smile so heartily. I smile back, but it is only a defensive reflex. As
long as I am smiling, she will be smiling too, and as long as she is
smiling, I will be happy. Because then I have something to smile about.
   She lights a cigarette and exhales smoke. I do not like myself when I am
smiling, I seem so distant and strange. False and artificial. Do I really
have any reason to smile? I do smile when I know I have something that I
wanted for some time, and I stop smiling when I realize that it is only a
matter of time before it disappears.
   When I am not smiling, I am thinking. About her, and all the other things
that can go wrong. I am about to say something to her, maybe "You're really
beautiful today" or "I'm so glad to see you" or plain and simple "I love
you". I want to say it to her. I want her to know that I love her so she can
say the same thing to me and we can smile together, united and equal. Two
pieces complementing each other. Two pieces being held together by the same
thing, that can tear them apart anytime. I like to touch her. I like to feel
the heat that is her. I feel so much more alive when she is gasping and
moaning in sexual arousal and I look forward to make love to her. I am
under heavy pressure. I have to satisfy her. I have to. There is no way
around it. She wants me to do it and she has given me the opportunity
several times.

"I want you" she gasped into my ear when a long period of chit-chat with her
parents was over and we were alone in her room. Her room is small and the
walls are empty. I felt at home there. Her father had pretended like he
liked me but I know he had big problems trying to accept what would happen
to his daughter - his sweet child - when the lights would be turned off and
we would be alone together. Had I been a normal person - like her father in
his younger days - I would be lying over and in her only minutes after the
lights went out.
   "Turn on the lights again," I said, feeling awfully stupid, ridiculous. A
total failure.
   "What's the matter?" she whispered in the darkness. I could hear that she
was worried and doubtful. Her hand slowly withdrew. The touch against
the naked skin on my stomach sent a flood of tickling sensations through me.
My skin grew goose pimples all over and I left out a moan. I entered another
world when she opened up my pants and started caressing me. Tiny electric
sparks flashed around inside me, my brain went into automatic and my
instincts took over. I moved my hand along her firm skin, away from her
small round breasts that had captured my attention, and down. First outside
her pants in small rubbing movements - my other hand were somewhere at her
back, then she opened her pants, took my hand in hers and guided it inside.
I was scared by the first touch. Her pubic hairs felt so astonishingly
similar to my own. She moaned, embraced me and mounted me. Then I said it.
   I could feel my heart beat like it was way too big for its little
reserved place. She started massaging it, carefully and tentatively. It grew
and felt comfortable between her silky fingers. Come on, don't let me down,
I have been waiting for seventeen years for this, feel how wonderful it
feels, put me in her! it shouted at me and I closed my eyes. Locked it out.
   "I can't", I shamefully said with a low and reluctant voice. "Not now."
   "Why?" The question floated in the air like an emergency flare. "You
don't want me?" She laid next to me in the narrow bed. We did not touch each
other.
   I prayed for my brain to return, to give me something sensible to say,
something that could explain. She let out a heavy sigh, on the brink of
crying. "I do not know what to say." My voice was shaking, like the last
leaf fighting the fall. "I want you. I love you."
   There, now you have said it. That was not so hard, was it? It was hard,
so goddamn hard, and I regret saying it the moment I had said it. I was on
the verge of crying myself. She must have noticed, because now she was lying
with her head on my chest, letting her fingers wander around my ear. They
became entangled in my hair, into emotionless pieces of me, comforting me
as if I had been a child.
   We stayed like that, stretched out next to each other, talking, I cried a
bit, she cried too, but I think it was only to make me feel better. I did
not manage to explain why I could not. I did not know myself, but she told
that I did not have to worry. We could do it when I felt ready for it. We
went out of the room, her father gave me stabbing looks, but her mother -
stepmother, I believe - smiled at us. I kissed Rachel goodbye and left. I
was nearly home when the breakdown struck me.

She puts her hand atop mine, caressing it. She is smiling. I curse myself
for not doing the same thing before her. What can I do now? Her hair, I love
it. It is black and smells like heaven, it is alive, healthy and it shines.
I want to touch it. Put my fingers inside it and let them go astray there. I
have to say something. I have not said anything to her.
   Anne walks by the window, she pretends like she does not see me and gives
Rachel a smile before she disappears. I have not fantasized about her for a
long time. Not since the time I realized that Rachel was not unattainable
after all. Now my penis is a temple, dedicated only to her. We worship her.
She is our goddess.
   I do not think very much of sex anymore. Earlier I was obsessed by it,
used every opportunity to fantasize and imagine how wonderful it would be.
So totally perfect. Now I fear the act. I don't know exactly why. I want to
do it, with her. I love her. She often said she loved me. She said it as if
it was something natural and she made it sound true. After some time, she
stopped saying it, probably because I never returned the declaration. I make
her feel uncertain. And she is uncertain now. Her eyes are uncertain, they
look towards mine, but never meet. She looks at me, I look at her hair. Her
fingernails are healthy and smooth, not all chewed up like mine.
   I wish I could say what she wants to hear. What she needs to hear. Any
moment now she will retract her hand, like she had touched a spider. Her
face will become twisted in disgust and she will spit angry words at me.
Knife cutting words. Words that slash and stab me, and I will just be
sitting there, alone, empty, bleeding. I will feel sorry for myself. How
could she, I will ask with a crying voice and then shut the answer out.
   I carefully remove my hand from hers, gently, and light up a cigarette.
   I exhale smoke.
