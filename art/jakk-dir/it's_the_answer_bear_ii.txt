DEAR ANSWER BEAR                           
                                           
LONG TIME LISTENER FIRST TIME CALLER

FOR ALMOST SIX MONTHS AND FINALLY TODAY    
HE SAID HE WANTED TO GO "ALL THE WAY"      
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY RELIGIOUS I       
THOUGHT YOU KNOW I SHOULD PROBABLY PUT     
OUT OR THE GUY'S GOING TO GO HIRE SOME     
PROSTITUTES                                
                                           
ANYWAY SO WE PICK A NIGHT AND MUCH TO MY   
SURPRISE I FIND OUT THAT "ALL THE WAY"     
MEANS HORRIBLE FISTING, ANAL, CREAMPIES,   
BUKKAKE, AND MUD FUN FOR SIX HOURS STRAIGHT
                                           
NEEDLESS TO SAY I'M FILTHY, STICKY,        
STRETCHED OUT, AND GLAZED LIKE A FAT HAM   
BUT MY REAL CONCERN IS WHETHER OR NOT I CAN
CHANGE HIM AND MOLD HIM TO MY WILL ???????

LIKES BRINGING ANIMALS INTO THE BEDROOM
