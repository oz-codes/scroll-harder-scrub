::LETTER FRuM dA EdItoR::
 
        Greetings from the guys at citadel/666.  We are just some guys
that are too elite for words and are sick of seeing all you losers
having fun doing whatever it is that you do when you do what you do
when you do it on your machines.  In other words, why should your
computing experience be hassle free?  Yea, thats what I said, fuckit, it
shouldn't...and it won't.
        We are dedicated to mentally and emotionally castrating morons.
Whether it be via something ultralame like irc [the SCOURGE of the net, 
downfall of anything remotely elite, take a look at article 3, and
you DO know that you are next rite erikb? -Ed] or social engineering your
mother, sister, one eyed aunt flossie, whatever it takes.  
        It all boils down to this basically:  we are bored and have a lot
of knowledge at our hands, and the fact that we are sadistic bastards makes
it a whole shitpotfull worse.
        So get used to it.  Cause we are a permanent establishment.
 
                        Love always:
 
                           Sneek
 
::2::Interview with biscuit::
 
 
        Interview takes place reel late at night like we are both tired.
 
 
[*ring ring ring*]
 
Biscuit: Hello?
Sneek: Hey its _______ whats up?
B: Nothing, whats up?
S: We are gonng put out a monthly rag page....im interviewing u now.
B: Cool, can I write some articles?
S: Of course dumbass, but first lets tell the people a little bit about
   yourself.
B: Uhh, ok.
S: What is your real name?
B: Hahahah blow me whats YOURS
S: Sven Speebocken, or something like that...so like what are you doing rite
   now.
B: Mounting ______________ 
S: Yea that place is pathetic.  So what do you think of so called security
   expert Kaplan?
B: His files weren't that interesting, old lame bugs n stuff.
S: Yea been there, done that.
B: Hahahahhahaha!
S: What about people who advocate the advancement of Gore's 
   Information Superhighway?
B: Fuck if I know. Gore is lame.
S: Gee could you be any more vague sphincter boy?
B: Thanks a lot.
S: Sorry did I hurt your fragile ego?
B: Don't ask me where your files went.
S: I KNOW where yours are.
B: Hahahahaha...
S: Anyway, do you think that we have anything POSITIVE to contribute to the 
   net?
B: In a nutshell, no. 
S: Yea me either.
B: I say we burn down hope.
S: Why don't you, me and wet_turd just crucify chris goggans and save 
   everyone a trip?
B: I don't know I kinda like his hair.
S: Fag.
B: Ask erikb about those n00die gifz in his homedir.
S: Family photos no doubt.  What do you do when you aren't on the net?
B: Dig ditches for the ______ State Highway Development Team.
S: Wow, you are like big and buff and I wanna be like you.  What do u think
   of that bag o rag GrayAreas?
B: I like fabricated stories about breakins.
S: So what are you saying be more specific.
B: The whole mag is made up, she has no clue.  And I am reading her mail
   right now, she should call ME up for an interview.
S: Bah, so like you are saying that those two geeks that she intereviewed
   were like not the real perps?
B: Well let's see...the guy that said he did it said he was paying for the
   call, yea I believe that was the real guy.  She is full of shit and
   should be hung with erikb. 
[ON A SIDE NOTE HAY NETTA ARE U GOING TO HOPE?!@# --malicious lafter--]
S: Yea she writes like she has had about 30 too many acid hits and can't
   quite let go of the sixties.  But I heard she can blow bubbles
   with Now'N'Laters.
B: I wouldn't know ask BlueAdept!
S: Uh Oh! I smell scandal! Whats the scoop do you have any details?
B: Only mail.
S: That's enough! Owell, thats enough for this issue, I think we have
   sufficiently showed our discontent with most people in general don't
   you?
B: Yea but we like need guns and stuff.
S: Wait for HOPE.
B: Ok.
S: Thanks fer yer time dorkboy.
B: Talk to u later smegrot.

 ::5:Shipley Goes Down Again:
 
 
                      *** Hacking Peter Shipley ***
 
 
       I was sitting on my ass one day thinking about how much I disliked
  Mr. Shipley, and I decided to show him how much of a fucking laff
  his security is. I will not go into details of how I did it, seeing as
  how the stoopid nig still doesn't get it. I figured it would be fun
  to go thru the spicz mail, so I did merde.dis.org, I would have been
  impressed if it had taken longer than ten minutes, I would have gotten
  in faster, but his link is some fucking 2400 baud slip in his backyard.
       Once I was in, and root I changed my id to him and started going
  through his files, basically the nigr didn't have jack fuckin shit,
  which really pissed me off, I mean, I wasted all of my time on a
  freakin tard boy who had nothing worth mentioning. He had "hidden"
  all of his security related material in a dir named "S" sneaky, sneaky,
  jew boy...here is a list of the bitches filez:

    At this point I was wigging on the fact I had wasted my time, I took
  a few of the more interesting old toys he had, and was ready to leave
  when "Please stop hacking my system" popped up on my tty. Now lets stop
  for a moment and reflect on this. Someone is going thru your files 
  online and you noticed, would you A) Pull the cable. B) Kill their shell.
  C) Echo to their tty and kindly ask them to stop. I think most people
  who dont need spoon feeding and a pipe up their ass to go to the
  bathroom would pick either A, or B. I decided to leave, figuring the
  pud hed didn't have anything usefull anyway, and anybody idiotic enuff
  to ask me to stop hacking there system wasn't worth the time of day.
    
    Not to dissapoint the educated readers of this journal I will include
  some interesting tidbits from Mr. Fuxhedz dir..
 
          Captured Mail Lameness:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Please don't bad mouth be behind my back else I will be more then
happy enough to confront you and/or muffy in both public and private
(and as you know I am not bothered by doing do)
 
also, please cease and desist attempting to hit an Annie, she is not
impressed by you.
 
it is very funny on how you had nothing bad to say about me and were very

                  *** Hacking Shitley Part #2 ***
 
      Well what the hell, I REALLLY dont like this guy.. the second time
  was much funnier than the first, after I hacked his ass again and
  he knocked me off the pansy ass got on the irc to bitch. He began
  whining to the people in #hack that he was fucking his girlfriend 
  when his computers audio alarms had gone off..wahh wahh, like the
  fuxing nig has a girlfriend. BTW, who the fuk has audio alarms on there
  computer? That is the biggest nigger rigged bullshit I have ever heard
  of..owell I decided to get on the irc and talk to mister shitpants. I
  told him I was the one who did it and gave him proof..he began
  babbling about how he would appreciate me mailing him a report on
  his security, and of course I was rolling on the fuckin ground trying
  to figure out why I didn't rm this effeminate fuck. I ripped on him
  and his arabic butt nudge friend jsz and left. Too much lameness for
  one day... 
  
 
 Pray for death bitch,
 
 Wet Terd

 ::6:Possee, legend or leftovers?::
 
        Late 1993/1994 brought us the infinite presence of p0sse.  A
 rag tag group of mostly moderately skilled (with exception) hacks
 with an insane ego.  These guys were a riot, breaking up irc for days 
 at a time.  Shutting down servers, hacking commercial systems, 
 raiding mail spools etc etc.  I had respect for them because they fucked
 with EVERYONE.
        BUT, they were obsessed with IRC.  I mean what the fuck is the
 point of taking down a server that will return within hours and if not
 then the next day.  They made a lot of enemies quick and did some sloppy
 hacks, and now are quit a bit quiter on irc.  Will wonders never cease.
 Amazing what a good scare will do to someone.
        They did some pretty cool shit breakin wise, but its all for not
 if you get popped.
        And that merc guy, gimme a fuckin break this guy.  A total 
 whiner, ass licking lap boy to PeaBoy, who seemed to run it all.  
 I had NO respect for this clit lint.  But he is being sought right now
 rumor has it, and I am sure that he is just sitting at home counting
 the days with his pet cockatiel.
        Owell, I hope that the rest of them do something remarkable,
 cause irc is real boring without them. [cause we dont give a shit
 enough to rip apart servers ! -ed]
        And what about that bitch n0elle.  Fucking airforce narc
 cunt.  I mean how many people can you say that you know that have
 their home wired for audio and video so that they can help pop
 w1ng [see next article on shaolin.com regarding w1ng -ed].  
 I think you see the fruits of thinking with your priq.

every1 gn0z how laym m0d is alreddy, but they have to be dumb and
put up a internet site (on a cheapass sl1p) [28.8 gn0 leSs!@# hahah -ed]
so they can be tres elite and irc as root on #hack.. whut a great 
idea, put a bunch of criminalz on one machine, that makes it al0t easier for
the phedz to log the access.net router!
 
anyone who has some skriptz can get an account on sha0lin.. its lame!@#
but luckily your citadel krew has an exclusive on the sha0lin breakin
that eye am sure u will be interested in..

 Well that brings us to the end of our first action packed issue.
 We had to make sure that we ripped on MOD and POSSE to make sure
 that no s1lly rumors started.  
        We hope you enjoyed it (but if you didn't it doesn't a rat's ass
 worth of difference to me), please send money/fanmail/bombthreats/inf0
 to the following address and we will get back to u as s00n as
 inhumanly possible.
