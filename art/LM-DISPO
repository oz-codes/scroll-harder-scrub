00,01Disposable hero

00,01Society beckons him to no end
00,01they cause for him, remorse and pain
00,01as an everyday man, he is only a friend
00,01with no gratitude it's hard to sustain
00,01To them, he is recyclable
00,01Use it for a while then just toss him away
00,01Cool, calm, not too excitable
00,01His life is of service, and of that it will stay
00,01Unlike Clarke Kent, he has no Lois Lane
00,01He leads an everyday life, no abnormalities
00,01Basically a life of dread, constant disdain
00,01He's useful at time, certain informalities
00,01This is how he's dying
00,01He's dying to survive
00,01I don't know what he's made of
00,01I would like to be that way
00,01Most just beckon him for their needs or wants
00,01Then play him off as a zero
00,01He lives for danger, does his own stunts
00,01Leading the life of a disposable hero
