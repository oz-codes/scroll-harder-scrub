15,01- Window Through the Eyes -



15,01Look into my eyes,
15,01See the reflection of your face;
15,01See into the depths of my soul.

15,01All that I am or can every dream of being
15,01Is locked inside -
15,01     Is locked inside the depths of my eyes.

15,01The window to the soul in the eye.
15,01It tells truth and truth alone.

15,01No false echo of disrespect,
15,01No laughing veil of hidden reality,
15,01Can every hide in the shadows
15,01     in the soul seen through the eye.

15,01The eye conveys ultimate and perfect trust,
15,01The tongue can speak lies,
15,01And the hands can act alone,
15,01But reality alone is present in the windows of the eyes.

15,01Look through my eyes to my heart.
15,01Find yourself reflected in my eyes and soul.

15,01The longer you stare,
15,01The purer and deeper truth becomes. . .

15,01Please, stare forever.
