15,01                                The Big Brag

15,01                               By Dr. Seuss

15,01                 The rabbit felt mighty important that day

15,01                On top fo the hill in the sun where he lay.

15,01                 He felt SO important up there on that hill

15,01                That he started in braggin, as animals will

15,01            And he boasted out loud, as he threw out his chest,

15,01               "Of all the beasts in the world, I'm the best!

15,01                  On land, and on sea...even up in the sky

15,01                   No animal lives who is better than I!"

15,01           "Whats that?" growled a voice that was terribly gruff.

15,01                "Now why do you say such ridiculous stuff?"

15,01               The rabbit looked down and he saw a big bear.

15,01          "I'm best of the beasts," said the bear. "And so there!"

15,01          "You're not!" snapped the rabbit. "I'm better than you!"

15,01                "Pooh!" the bear snorted. "Again I say Pooh!

15,01               You talk mighty big, Mr. Rabbit.  That's true.

15,01              But how can you prove it? Just what can you DO?"

15,01                      * "Hmmmm..." thought the rabbit,

15,01                         * "Now what CAN I do...?"

15,01               He thought and he thought. Then finally said,

15,01              "Mr. Bear, do you see these two ears on my head?

15,01                My ears are so keen and so sharp and so fine

15,01             No ears in the world can hear further than mine!"

15,01             "Humpf!" the bear grunted. He looked at each ear.

15,01            "You say they are good," said the bear with a sneer

15,01              "But how do I know just how far they can hear?"

15,01           "I'll prove," said the rabbit, "my ears are the best.

15,01            You sit there and watch me. I'll prove it by test."

15,01          Then he stiffened his ears till they both stood up high

15,01              And pointed straight up at the blue of the sky.

15,01              He stretched his ears open as wide as he could.

15,01                "Shhh! I am listening!" he said as he stood.

15,01                he listened so hard that he started to sweat

15,01               And the fur on his ears and forehead got wet.

15,01              For seven long minutes he stood. Then he stirred

15,01            And he said to the bear, "Do you know what I heard?

15,01          Do you see that far mountain...? It's nienty miles off.

15,01          There's a fly on that mountain. I just heard him cough!

15,01             Now the cough of a fly, sir, is quite hard to hear
