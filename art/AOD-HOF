00,01Hearts of Fire

00,01Weird and foolish,
00,01we must consider the idea,
00,01that we are all as one.
00,01As thou hearts are full and grateful,
00,01we must remember that friendship is like society.
00,01People need friends to survive,
00,01and I am one of them.

00,01Hearts of Fire will never cease,
00,01as love and hopes shall never decrease,
00,01Love and God,
00,01forsaken things,
00,01as we must agree, and disagree,
00,01they are still close and near.
