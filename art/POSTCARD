15,01Not even a copy of a copy of  the  original.  THE  original.  Not even
15,01Tomppa will get to keep his own art this time around.

15,01     Yes,  it's  really  that simple.  And,  once  again  letting  our

15,01if it matches, you win.  Just  kidding.  Simply jot in CLEAR lettering
15,01your return address,  and  you are automagically entered into the con-
15,01test.  If you like,  you can also tell us why  ACiD Productions  is so
15,01darn nifty.  But that's not necessary.
