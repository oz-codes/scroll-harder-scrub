15,01        Another relaxing friday night in front of the computer, thought James.
15,01Settling into his well-padded swiveling chair, he turned on the power switch.
15,01His terminal loaded immediately;  He had set it to, since it was almost all he
15,01used his computer for anymore.  He had forsaken what he had left of a social
15,01life in his town for the modem, as when he called boards his personality was
15,01changed, almost magically, from the shy, inverted James into the violent,
15,01outspoken Bovaline.  

15,01        "What board to call," James thought.  He knew so many; Purple Reign,
15,01Digital Inferno, Schweppetek.  Eternal Insanity, yes, that was the one.  He
15,01had not called Eternal Insanity for a few days, and was already missing it.
15,01He missed the full-blown configuration the sysop, MindCrime, had set up.  He
15,01missed all the messages, where he could be himself.  No, not himself; He was
15,01a great actor, but while he never got on a stage in his life, he did act - 
15,01Whenever he called this board, he became the great Bovaline, and he felt as 
15,01though he could do anything.  Could he?  Sometimes he wondered.  Sometimes he
15,01wanted to try things, but something held him back.  He wanted to fly like a 
15,01bird, most of all.  He just wanted to know how it would be, the wind rushing
15,01by his face, propelled by nothing but Bovaline's powerful muscles.  He knew
15,01he could never do this, but still a part of him wanted to try, wanted to just
15,01jump into the air and fly off into the sky.

15,01        He was startled out of his thoughts when the modem screeched.  He
15,01recognised the connect as a 14,400 connect before it even showed up on the 
15,01screen, as he had memorized all the sounds a modem can make from his extensive
15,01use of them.  The opening screen showed up.  "Wow, he changed the welcome 
15,01screen again!"  It seemed as though every time he called, something changed,
15,01something that made it even more real for him, drew him further into the guise
15,01of Bovaline.  

15,01        He immediately entered the messages menu - That was where his friends
15,01were, and he was anxious to talk to them.  The first message he saw was one
15,01telling him he was a pathetic little fuck.  His veins in his forehead were
15,01close to popping out.  No one, but NO ONE, treats Bovaline that way.  He
15,01wrote back another flame message, and continued.  The next message told him
15,01to please keep his posts on topic, or he would lose access.  This was too 
15,01much.  He quickly pressed Alt-H and exited the terminal program, and turned 
15,01off the computer.  "Damn it, why couldn't people see how great I can be?  Why
15,01can't they all love me?  DAMN IT WHY?"

15,01        Something had to be done.  He was too tense.  First he grabbed his
15,01squeeze-man his mother had bought for him after he throw a chair at his door,
15,01so he would have something to take out his anger on.  He ripped it in half and 
15,01threw it at his back wall.  He knew what he had to do;  He must fly.  Bovaline
15,01must fly today.  He walked out onto the back wall, knowing he could not do it,
15,01knowing that the great Bovaline would guide him through the air.  As he 
15,01stepped out onto the foot-wide ledge, he looked down, and his mind raced with
15,01second thoughts.  But the thoughts were banished with one look up at the sky,
15,01he saw that the sky was his domain and he must control it, be one with it.
15,01The people below screamed; One ran for a phone.  For a while he just sat
15,01there, high up above the city on his ledge.  After a while he decided it was
15,01time.  He got up, gathered a breath, and flew.  He went up for a brief second,
15,01but quickly plummeted towards the ground.

15,01        What had gone wrong, so wrong that he could not fly?  He knew... He
15,01was having doubts, and that was wrong.  He tried to believe, he DID believe
15,01with all his heart that he could fly.  His mind flew to the clouds, he 
15,01bounced on the rubbery surface of a cloud, and lay down to take a nap.  He 
15,01felt something on his wrist but was too tired to stay awake.  

15,01        He woke up in a dark room.  Getting up he felt around, and discovered
15,01it was a room made of clouds.  "This won't be so bad," he decided.


15,01------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15,01        "Mrs. Jacobson, we have some bad news for you.  Your son has a rare 
15,01genetic disorder, which is what caused him to jump off your apartment 
15,01building.  He still believes he can fly, in fact, he believes his padded room
15,01is a cloud at this very moment.  But don't worry, we'll take great care of 
15,01him, we're very experienced with patients of this sort."

15,01        "Is there ever any hope for him," Mrs. Jacobson said between tears.

15,01        "I'm sorry, Mrs. Jacobson.  I'm afraid your son has no hope;
15,01his disease has given him a case of Eternal Insanity."
