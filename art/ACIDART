15,01========================================================================

15,01 Introduction:

15,01 Thank you for  considering membership in ACiD,  the greatest and
15,01 most popular  Art Creating Group ever!  ACiD is a group which is
15,01 comprised  of  a  select  few  of  the  most  talented  computer
15,01 artists in  the  world.   Unfortunately,  not  everyone  has the
15,01 talent required to become an ACiD member.  Many inferior artists
15,01 rely on an acquired skill  when  creating their art.  Many times
15,01 this  skill  is  derived  from  much  practice  and  many  times
15,01 "borrowed" ideas from the artwork  of others.  These are NOT the
15,01 types of artists that ACiD is  looking for.  ACiD is looking for
15,01 people with not only SKILL,  but TALENT and ORIGINALITY in their
15,01 artistic creations.  ANSi/VGA is  art  just  like any other.  If
15,01 you are serious about your art,  and have the skill,  talent and
15,01 originality that it takes  to  create  professional looking art,
15,01 then you may have what it takes to be an ACiD member.

15,01 Of course,  you'll have to prove you have what it takes to be an
15,01 ACiD  member.  The  following  application  will  help  ACiD  to
15,01 decide whether or not  you will be a member.  Please fill it out
15,01 COMPLETELY,  leaving   NO  BLANKS   whatsoever.   If  you  leave
15,01 omissions or answer questions dishonestly, your application will
15,01 be discarded no matter how good your art is, so please be honest
15,01 and thorough.

15,01                                              -- The <ACiD> Staff
