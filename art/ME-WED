00,01Weeds

00,01If the grey sky permits,
00,01 Tears to fall into the harsh soil,
00,01 Some sort of daydream will edge through...
00,01 Hope had left these lost souls,
00,01 Killing time, wasteing what precious time
00,01  we have,
00,01 In a delirium of drug induced pleasure-

00,01This place of escape,
00,01 This place of walls,
00,01 Vices,
00,01 Death and freedom,
00,01 But where is freedom now?
00,01 This is not the paradise we dreamed it
00,01  to be,
00,01 Nor is this a premonition,
00,01 Not anything so minor-

00,01Welcome, lost daydreamers,
00,01 Time breaths,
00,01 Moves, creeps,
00,01 Repeats
00,01 And says...
00,01 "I will never come again."
00,01 So we wait,
00,01 And grow old,
00,01 Only to turn back on all those years,
00,01 To look up at a sky that grows darker
00,01  everyday,
00,01 To waste...
00,01 There is no better way-

00,01When we fell from grace
00,01 We became one with the damned,
00,01 Moneyless...
00,01 In a land where money is everything,
00,01 Crying...
00,01 In a place where tears mean nothing.

00,01To the soil,
00,01 To the man,
00,01 To the clock,
00,01 That will toll mine and yours
00,01  to our graves,
00,01 Oh... the clock,
00,01 That will not fade,
00,01 Or be disgraced-

00,01Then again I kindly intercede,
00,01 Then again I raise my voice to ask,
00,01 What does it mean...?
00,01 And in the end
00,01 Will there be an end,
00,01 Or just the last flicker of dying star?-

00,01The end will keep us hoping for a new
00,01  beginning,
00,01 Deep inside the sorrows of this weeping
00,01  season,
00,01 Weeds are all that we have,
00,01 And all that we need,
00,01 When flowers no longer bloom-
