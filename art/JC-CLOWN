15,01killing the clown

15,01killing the clown, it's time that he died
15,01cattle shock prod to the head so happy he's fried
15,01The clown was nice and made me feel good inside
15,01Last night things changed, I laughed as it died
15,01spiked bat to the head
15,01oh yea it's quite dead
15,01Baby this clown aint you it's the feeling you stir in my head
15,01But after last night I see you through pain stricken eyes of red
15,01my anger burns high, high like the flame that rules my world
15,01my pain stricken world, a world where you, you and your ways tear 
15,01at the very fibers of my existance, my being, my life, my soul
15,01you could have owned me
15,01the flame covers fills and envelops me causeing the true euphoria
15,01that I need to survive
15,01like a cliff jumpers dive
15,01I need you
