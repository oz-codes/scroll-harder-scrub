00,01   14Nitro is back for our third and final release.  I would like to thank the
14,01   following for the last time:
15,01     14Fizban: Thanks for all the help.  Good luck wherever you are :)
15,01     14Satan's Jester: Thanks for couriering all the packs.
15,01     14Reaper: You'd be the workhorse.  Thanks for everything.
15,01     14Thanatos: You were great when you were around.  Don't lose what you
15,01               14already have.
15,01     14Maestro: Kick ass with Nation.
15,01     14Phaser-X: I didn't mean to go off on you on HM.. Good luck in
15,01               14Manifest.
15,01     14Decker: I don't know what you did :) but have a good one.
15,01     14Nitro Sites: Thanks for helping us out.
15,01     14Hot Rod: How ere my Lits?  Not too bad I think for my first attempts.
15,01     14Technophreak: Your an excellent artist.. Don't slack off..
15,01     14Nemesis: Well, you were here for about 2 weeks.  Thanks..

15,01     14I want to give a big 'fuck you' to all those cut-throat ansi artists.
15,01     14The scene is really beginning to flal apart.  Why do you all have to
15,01     14ruin it by bashing people you don't even know?  So what if the group
15,01     14sucks or whatever, keep it to yourself.  In my opinion, Ansi Art is
15,01     14just another hobby.  No one in the scene is going to become a
15,01     14"Professional Ansi Artist."  If you can't really enjoy drawing ansi
15,01     14or writing literary, then don't do it.  I wasn't around for long,
15,01     14but for the time I was around, I could see this whole scene slipping
15,01     14away.

15,01         14Thanks to all who supported us (hah).  We didn't want to close
15,01         14operations but we were getting nowhere.  So, for the final time,
15,01         14thanks...

15,01                                                 14..Hammer [Nitro Prez]..
