15,01As I wander through the halls,
15,01My halls of despair.
15,01I hear a voice, alone,
15,01Calling my name.

15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me, rescue my soul.
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me.

15,01"It's burning", he tells me.
15,01I've no hope but you-
15,01You are the only one who will help me,
15,01You are the only one who can save me.

15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me, save my soul.
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me.

15,01"There must be another solution", he says.
15,01Perhaps armageddon is the solution-
15,01Perhaps annihilation would be better.
15,01But then you would be gone.

15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me, clear my soul.
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me.

15,01"Time's up", he calls.
15,01Your spears sear me-
15,01Pissing hot napalm.
15,01You have destroyed me.

15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me, ignite my cold sun.
15,01Oh please, come and find me,
15,01Oh please, come and find me.
