15,01        Gypsy Enchantment

15,01Slowly strumming his guitar,
15,01While she danced around the fire,
15,01Her body, an undulating vision
15,01My eyes filled with her

15,01She came before me,
15,01Stroking my hair.
15,01Filling my senses,
15,01With her sensuality

15,01Silently she danced around me
15,01Touching me with her gaze
15,01I stood enchanted
15,01To the gypsy woman spell

15,01The crackling fire
15,01Fails to hide my desires
15,01The guitar played on to the night
15,01And I am lost to her gaze
