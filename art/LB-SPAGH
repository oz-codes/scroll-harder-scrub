15,01DRUGS are NOT AN ANSWER!

15,01fuck the chemical companies that think they own the rights to your happinness!

15,01it's all bullshit.
15,01our lives are engineered by socciety so that we consume...
15,01 consume..
15,01   consume..

15,01eat their products.

15,01have to fit in.
15,01 have meet certain aesthetic ideals.
15,01   can't sweat.. that's gross...
15,01not happy ? take these .. that'll be $140 please...

15,01BITCH!
15,01 FUCK

15,01why CANNOT we break out of this shit.

15,01 ONE thing I know is that the answer comes from within.

15,01change helps.. change can be scary but it sets you at 0..
15,01      right after a change you have no rut.
15,01           no excuse.
15,01 if you make your rut again you'll have to look at yourself.

15,01why you engineer your own failure.

15,01I have.
15,01I don't know why I make myself fail.
15,01I don't think it's a fear of success..

15,01dunno.

15,01engineer.



15,01consume.
15,01advertise.
15,01brainwash.

15,01bloody hell.


15,01doesn't everything just suck ?
15,01shouldn't there be more ?

15,01I'e said it before and I'll say it again. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

15,01I am not happy and I don't know what the fuck to do about it.

15,01love is nice.
15,01too many people overuse that word.
15,01                                     

15,01consume love.

15,01everything YOU do is because you will get some benefit from it.

15,01if you give all your life savings to some guy you're doing it because it makes
15,01you feel good inside. You are doing it for yourself.

15,01love is very one way.
15,01it's fun giving because the more you give the more you receive generally.
15,01and we all like receiving love.
15,01but when you give lots and receive little/none you feel hurt.
15,01 resentful.
15,01frustrated.
15,01burned.


15,01BLOODY HELL!!!

15,01everything is just so fucking lame.
