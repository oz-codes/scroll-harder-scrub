15,01straight for the deep end, and stopped.  I didn't want to go. 
15,01Something scared me.  Then, for no apparent reason, I fell, and
15,01screamed the word GOLP.  GOLP, yes, GOLP.  I don't know what GOLP
15,01means, and while screaming the gibberish I grabbed onto the into
15,01leftover of the handrail.  The bridge wants me, it opens the the
15,01bowels of its black hole at its end, its wants me.  And it saved
15,01my life by providing this iron guardrail for me to hold onto. n
15,01Then a brick wall, hell, I don't know where it came from, it fell 
15,01and bashed the hell out of my arm.  It fell onto my arm while I
15,01was climbing up to save my sorry life.  I remember screaming,
15,01then falling and cracking my arm in the shape of an N, and then
15,01seeing a load of blood everywhere.  I could not feel my arms, but
15,01from my examination of others I know I was messed up royally. 
15,01The bridge, oh that son of a bridge, it created my downfall.  I
15,01lie here now, soaking wet in nuclear bomb waste, and justto
15,01flashing on and off about bombs coming down, its pointy nosere. 
15,01coming right down my skull.  And I lie there, just laughing, hee, 
15,01and I don't do anything.  MY HANDS!  My glorious hands!  They're
15,01completely shot!  Ill never be able to write again!  HA!  It was
15,01my LEFT ARM!! Irony to the person who laughs at me!  I can't do
15,01squat!  How will I catch my food now?  I'm SOOOOO hungry!!  My
15,01stomach is yelling at me, and all I do is drink water and vomit. 
15,01I cannot go back. I will not.  The bridge, the bridge is thetuck
15,01thing that keeps me going.  When I go, I will go well, to they
15,01bridge.he bridge. 

15,01     YOOWWWCH!!!! My arms hurt!  I can't feel anything above myn
15,01chest, and my legs look like a pretzel!  But as they say, theer,
15,01calm before the storm.  So I don't want relief.  They tylenolsets
15,01keeps most of the pain away, and I don't want to get into the
15,01Trike.  Not yet.  I am hurting.  H-U-R-T-I-N-G.ow.  

15,01May 15

15,01     I definitely know someone is out there.  Don't we all?  The
15,01bridge spews its holographic crap to confuse me.Some big flyinge,
15,01ship sailed right across my face, blowing wind and dust, and ang
15,01big piece of pink shrapnel caught me right in the thigh. ter and
15,01Screamed my fool face off. I pulled it out and just gaped at ther
15,01sky.  The ship flew off after a few seconds, as it was just it
15,01passing over.  I screamed when it was there, before, and hoursw.  
15,01after until my throat hurt and my hands and feet and legs andhink
15,01everything just swelled up so bad that I could write Goodyear onI
15,01them and it could replace the blimp.  They could be a whole fleet
15,01of blimps!  I've made a makeshift help sign, crawling all of
15,01yesterday.  I had only one hand and a couple of mangled legs to
15,01work with, so that's why I couldn't write.  The sign is aboutaway
15,01four feet high, and each letter is about my height wide.  That's
15,01maybe five or six feet.  I can't THINK!! My ankle hurts so bad. 
15,01At a guess, I'd say I've lost about 20 pounds since I escaped the
15,01vault.  My beard itches like electric ants!  Anyway, from my post
15,01under the bridge the nuclear sun reflects the four letters Il he
15,01wrote with pink Cadillac parts: H E L P.  Another airship, if it
15,01looks down, won't miss me.res.  She hit the silent alarm, and I
15,01slid into vault to ring the phone to the police.  The teller, as
15,01     The discoloration has started above the wrist, above the!!!
15,01thigh, above the ankle, and of course, above the neck.  I have
15,01begun to think that no one is going to help me.  Everything has 
15,01gone from blue to black to yellow and back to blue.aw the bum put
15,01the gun in his mouth and splatter his guts over some old bag.  I
15,01     I may have to amputate.  (But what?  Everything?  Above the
15,01neck?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!)n before the door of the vault
15,01slid shut.  Then a huge bang that burst my ears rocked the vault,
15,01and I fell asleep.  I woke up to the locked vault.  As I opened
15,01it, for some strange reason, I scratched my head so hard that
15,01blood poured down my face.  I don't know, but the taste
15,01fascinated me.

15,01May 16 stepped out of the vault, and was blinded by the daylight
15,01that hit my eyes.  I saw the rotting dead carcasses in front of
15,01     The pain has gotten worse still.  Even the Tylenol and daily
15,01aspirins don't work.  If I don't get rid of it, i'll go nuts. 
15,01Almost half the day now, my body just starts shaking, and Ie was
15,01convulse violently.  I an pretty confident that I will have to,
15,01amputate.  The blackness is now the whole area of the foot, and
15,01the toenails have started to fall out.  I have everything if I
15,01need it, pain killer, a knife, bandages, etc.  I must concentrate
15,01and keep my strength, as the shaking has come on strong now.  My
15,01hand is tired.  The damn wrong hand.  Oh, but I couldn't write to
15,01you guys if it was my right hand.  I'm going to end it, stop.d my
