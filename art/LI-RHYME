15,01Walking, walking through the trees,
15,01trip and fall upon my knees,
15,01get back up and brush them off,
15,01airborne dirt, it makes me cough,
15,01running through the forest green,
15,01I feel just so completely clean,
15,01through the creek I splash and skip,
15,01upon some algae I do slip,
15,01and hit my skull on solid rock,
15,01float downstream, past boats, past docks,
15,01water-logged I'm carried down,
15,01my drowned corpse never shall be found,
15,01the ocean, wide, deep, blue and still,
15,01into which the river spills,
15,01takes my body in its mass,
15,01to swim with sharks and whales and bass,
15,01over weeks I soon decay,
15,01my lips are blue, my skin is gray,
15,01tiny creatures eat my flesh,
15,01they care not whether I am fresh,
15,01returned to the environment,
15,01my nutrients are swiftly sent,
15,01back through the food chain, on and on,
15,01until you eat those deep fried prawns,
15,01so next time that you eat seafood,
15,01do not blame me if it's no good,
15,01cause I did not mean to trip and fall,
15,01and I am recycled after all.
