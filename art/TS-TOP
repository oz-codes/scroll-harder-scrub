15,01What is wrong... And what is right...
15,01Who are we to judge..
15,01Others based upon our own actions...
15,01Maybe its a conspiracy..
15,01That we're not supposed to know...
15,01Maybe its something...
15,01Far too inclined to understand...
15,01One day we'll find out..
15,01What is right.. What is wrong...
15,01The day of the almighty..
15,01The day of the judgement...
15,01We'll find out if we've been right all along...
15,01Right in judging others...
15,01Telling them what they can't do...
15,01Maybe those who broke away..
15,01And did their own thing..
15,01Are the lucky ones..
15,01They didn't get sucked into a trap...
15,01A pit of no return...
15,01A pit that everyone will enter one day..
15,01A pit that no one comes out of...
15,01We should all break away..
15,01Take the other path of life...
15,01When we come to the crossroad...
15,01And be the one to avoid the traffic...
