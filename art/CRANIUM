15,01------------------------

15,01      Well, I hope I can make this quick and to the point.  Don't expect 
15,01    anything fancy from this info file.  If you're reading this, you 
15,01    probably don't have anything better to do, and will end up reading
15,01    the entire file anyway--so what am I worrying about?
15,01  
15,01      Here we are, we made some ansis and vgas, put them together and got
15,01    ourselves a neat little name: Cranium...and why not, lets make it 
15,01    sound somewhat professional, and add "productions" to it.  That's   
15,01    basically all there is to it.  What are we?  You probably already 
15,01    realized this, but for those of you who are mentally challenged (and
15,01    are still reading this), Cranium Productions is yet another small
15,01    art group born in the art scene.  Scene? What scene?  What is this we
15,01    refer to as scene?  Hell, I don't know; maybe people need to make up
15,01    a name like that to refer to the intangible world of images and 
15,01    words behind their computer screens.  Frankly, I don't care what
15,01    you call it as long as you keep the word "cyber" out of it.  All
15,01    I'm concerned about is that a copy of our premiere pack found its way 
15,01    into your hard drive, so you now have a chance to check us out.  
15,01                                             
15,01      Cranium is based in the 407 area code.  It's amazing how many new
15,01    art and demo groups are coming out.  Regardless, we decided to put 
15,01    this out, and see what happens.  If all works out well, we will be
15,01    releasing a new packet regularly--at this point we are hoping it will
15,01    be every month, but you all know how that goes.  Remember, we all
15,01    have lives outside of our computers, weird isn't it?

15,01      Anyway, I said this wasn't gonna be too long, but this "simple" info
15,01    file is now uncontrollable and is growing out of proportion.  For now
15,01    Cranium is composed of 3 artists and one fine coder.  Like everyone
15,01    else out there, we are looking for some good artists, coders and
15,01    musicians.  Hey, if you think you'd be a good addition to the team, 
15,01    don't hesitate in contacting us (information follows).  We are also
15,01    looking for boards that will distribute our art, so if you run a
15,01    board and are interested in being a distribution site for Cranium, 
15,01    contact us too.  Use our application generator (CAPP11.ZIP) to apply.
15,01    Send out the completed form to our Headquarters or uuencode it and 
15,01    mail it to me.

15,01      I'm still trying my hand at music, so expect some music on our next 
15,01    release.  Also expect a bigger pack.  Being this our first one, we
15,01    struggled to release it, and finally decided to put it out as
15,01    it is, without further delays that would have taken us nowhere.

15,01      I won't bore you with personal infoz and similar crap.  Does it  
15,01    matter anyway?  Just judge us from what you see; no further explanations
15,01    required.  No need to portray ourselves with k-rad-elite crap and 
15,01    all those idiotic attitudes that plague the so called "scene."  We  
15,01    do this for fun, so we really couldn't care less what you decide to 
15,01    call yourself, or us for that matter.
15,01      
15,01      If you like our work and need something similar to what you see,  
15,01    send your requests!  We'll see what we can do to help you.  We'd like
15,01    to hear from anyway.  Send us your requests, comments, and food stamps
15,01    to our Headquarters, or reach me [XtEn] at:
