Dear Torn,
  Ah the classic love triangle. The situation is really not fair to anyone,
  but the longer you stay in it the stickier it will get.[teehee] Get your
  long-term relationship out in the open. Whatever you decide to do, do it
  fast and gently!

"The Warrior's Prayer," by blewt [L0CK]

To my ancestors, whom I shall leave anonymous, and my man, max-q:

I leave this day for battle.
I know not whom I fight.
The victory is not certain.
For our enemies are strong.

I carry myself with courage.
Though I quake with fear.
I fight them all with honor.
For I have my brothers near.

Oh ye I pray to thee,
Those who came before,
For the strength of heart I need...
Just to lift this keyboard.

I know I seem the coward,
Standing on the snow.
I no longer wear my armor.
I have lost my will to love.

What can I do with this life,
O ye in the beyond?
How can I look the others in the face,
Now that my will to love is gone?

So to thee I say my final goodbye,
And a hardy forget-me-not.
For I'll always have my brothers,
And together we are [L0CK].

               - blewt - 1995
