15,01The 5th Kwest(ion?)
15,01--------------------


15,01        A brief item of interest. The author of this info file (at least, part
15,01of it) is written by none other than meatpod, formerly of Serial Ascii. Why am
15,01I writing this, you ask? I've never really been down with the K, nor do I plan
15,01to be in the near future. I don't even like rap. However, I did feel like it
15,01might be a trip, so here it is. A lot of things have happened in the scene
15,01since the dispersal of Serial (which didn't happen for the reasons you think
15,01it did, I assure you). Groups have sprung up, died, muchos shit has gone down,
15,01my brothers. One thing that hasn't changed is that kW!a continues to release
15,01quality shit. kWEST has always been a place where skilled artists gathered to
15,01put out their work -- always original, laid-back but never limp, and strongly
15,01opinionated. This month's pack is perhaps a little smaller than last months,
15,01but don't let this fool you -- It's smooth shit, gets you right in the face. So
15,01throw it up for cain and friends, united as kWEST.

15,01--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15,01* note from Cain, word up Jules. I'll take it from here.
15,01--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15,01        It's good to know, for me anyways, that Kwest is all about friendship.
15,01Scene domination is easy enough for me to handle, but I don't want it. I don't
15,01have enough support these days as it is. And the amount of people jacking on
15,01me, is NUTS->Ie; Black Jack;  whatever, mr. Icandopicsbutbackgroundsandfontsare-
15,01abovemyskillasanasciiartist, why don't you 1) hit puberty 2) expand your skills
15,01then we'll talk about you talking shit to me, ok?. Good. Tek, sorry for jacking
15,01on you so hard, it's not as bad as I thought it was, my baad.


15,01        I tried to form an ascii scene powerhouse, fuck that. A good many of you
15,01turned your back on me because I tried, and killed kwest without asking you,
15,01and once it re-formed, you decided to stay gone. I know at least one person is
15,01trying to stay with Kwest, big ups --> you know who you are. But as for the rest
15,01of you, pfft; Do you have any respect for me? Kwest? Your homes in kwest stand,
15,01forever.. but again, refer to the question.

15,01        Quit dualling, it's annoying, I sit back and watch the ascii scene now
15,01that I can just chill in Kwest, and as myself and The Don have discussed,
15,01everyone in the ascii scene, is in every goddam group. Did anyone seen phunk!a?
15,01yeah..every person in that group is in 6 groups, pfft.. Let's see some serious
15,01competition here. Scrooe this scene unity your all trying for, get at each
15,01others necks, rip into each other, start fights.. who cares? I would much
15,01rather see that, then this sissy bullshit. I have to apologize for jumping all
15,01over the place, but it's all just hitting me now as I write this up. The scene
15,01is about group pride, where the hell is yours? KWESTSIIIIIIIIIDE.

15,01        I should thank Sargon for being such a troublemaker; he had the scene
15,01on it's fucking toes as long as Serial was alive. By the waay, big ups to all
15,01you ex-serialers, I hated you, but I guess that is the point eh?. You see, the
15,01basic point of this is; LET'S SEE SOME FUCKING ASCII. NOT POINTLESS BITCHING,
15,01AND BITING, AND FAKING, AND JACKING, GET ORIGINAL, GET FUCKING NUTS. I've been
15,01here for two years, I've kept it real, most of the people I affiliate myself
15,01with keep it real, you do it *TOO*.

15,01        It's easy. Every one person, pick a group that is 'competing' (odelay,
15,01remorse, phunk.. WHATEVER) JOIN IT, (AND ONLY THAT GROUP) and release ascii
15,01with them. BAM, we have an ascii scene back. The way I see it now, the scene is
