15,01I am the 04Soul Controller00.

15,01I do not own you,
15,01but it is me you have to thank for EVERYthing you have.

15,01When you were born, I was there,
15,01for every first in your life,
15,01for every last in your life,
15,01from the beginning,
15,01and to the end,
15,01I have been there.

15,01I have seen it all,
15,01the things you thought no one else saw,
15,01and the things you did but denied,
15,01the lives you destroyed recklessly,
15,01and the few good things you did,
15,01all of which you made sure you recieved credit.

15,01I hold in my possession your soul,
15,01it is by my will that you prosper or wither.
15,01either beneath my boot, or comforted in my hands,
15,01you all are beneath me, in my favor or not.

15,01Like the grains of sand,
15,01there are a myriad of souls I hold,
15,01but also, like anything in life,
15,01nothing is infinite, eternal;
15,01except me...

15,01For I am the00 04Soul Controller00.
