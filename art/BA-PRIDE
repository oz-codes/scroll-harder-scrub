15,01. Pride .

15,01--------------


15,01You know what the first rule of nature is?

15,01The careless creatures die first

15,01The first thing, the book said, was to test the power. If the lights go on,
15,01something's wrong.

15,01Would he bother?

15,01No. It had never happened before. Fool. That didn't mean it never would happen.

15,01Familiarity breeds carelessness. He'd done it thousands of times. He'd just
15,01check the main switch. Careless. Careless creatures die.

15,01Did he deserve it?

15,01Of course.

15,01In nature, the weak and feeble died. But man glorified them. He was a weak man.
15,01His shell showed the results of years of exertion. But rippling meat pales
15,01beneath the power of a strong mind. And his mind was weak.

15,01He was a creature of pride. Tall and strong. But pride is mindless, and so is
15,01he.

15,01He had come. The tower of meat. Vaguely contemptuous of the weak of limb.

15,01Fool.

15,01Anyone should know that the truth is always hidden.

15,01Carelessness dies. Pride will die today too. The switch casually flicked from
15,01on, to death. Anyone should know that reality is the opposite of appearance.
15,01Pride is going now. Pride is starting. Preparing for suicide. Pride will die,
15,01but the Wise will live on.

15,01Leave Pride to its fate. Just watch for the moment. The flicker of the light,
15,01showing Pride's fall.

15,01Think. Remember. Pride caused its own fall. Arrogance on ridicule on
15,01carelessness. None but the foolish ridicule the Wise.

15,01Beauty cannot see the mind. Neither can Pride. But the Wise can. That is what
15,01makes them wise. That is why the Wise are the rulers. That is why the Wise are
15,01the judges. That is why Pride is going to fall.

15,01The Pride who had the arrogance to steal away Beauty. The Pride with the
15,01arrogance to say he was sorry. What can Pride know of love? Love is of the
15,01mind, and the mind belongs to the Wise. The arrogance to ridicule him. He, the
15,01Wise. Talking of love and devotion. Pride could not find a grain of true
15,01devotion in his entire hulking existence.

15,01Pride chose to die when Pride asked for Beauty. Beauty let Pride die when
15,01Beauty was blind to the mind. A fitting fall for an unfitting couple.

15,01None should rule the Wise. The Wise are the natural rulers of all. Pride,
15,01Beauty, strength and courage. None could withstand the decisions of the Wise.

15,01A flicker!

15,01Pride had not withstood. The Wise had decided, and Pride had been cast down.

15,01To see the proof. To view the lifeless meat, if you could have called its
15,01previous existence life. A brainless, ambling existence. Strength and grace
15,01without true inner strength and grace. There is nothing as strong or as
15,01graceful as the mind.

15,01Pride was there. His body a husk. Torn throughout by the power that was the
15,01vengeance of the Wise. His hand still grasped his Doom. He had not checked the
15,01light. Carelessness brings death, and that carelessness was no exception.

15,01To see his face. To see how he looked at the moment of realisation. Quickly
15,01roll him over. No! Stop! Too late...
