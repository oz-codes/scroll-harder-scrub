15,01The following is a direct quote from the Center for Strategic and
15,01International Studies report on GLOBAL ORGANIZED CRIME;  the author who
15,01introduces the story swears it's true.

15,01FBI agents conducted a raid of a psychiatric hospital in San Diego that was
15,01under investigation for medical insurance fraud.   After hours of reviewing
15,01thousands of medical records, the dozens of agents had worked up quite an
15,01appetite.  The agent in charge of the investigation called a nearby pizza
15,01parlor with delivery service to order a quick dinner for his colleagues.

15,01The following telephone conversation took place and was recorded by the FBI
15,01because they were taping all conversations at the hospital.

15,01Agent:  Hello.  I would like to order 19 large pizzas and 67 cans of soda.

15,01Pizza Man:  And where would you like them delivered?

15,01Agent:  We're over at the psychiatric hospital.

15,01Pizza Man:  The psychiatric hospital?

15,01Agent:  That's right.   I'm an FBI agent.

15,01Pizza Man:  You're an FBI agent?

15,01Agent:  That's correct.   Just about everybody here is.

15,01Pizza Man:  And you're at the psychiatric hospital?

15,01Agent:   That's correct.   And make sure you don't go through the front
15,01doors.  We have them locked.   You will have to go around to the back to the
15,01service entrance to deliver the pizzas.

15,01Pizza Man:   And you say you're all FBI agents?

15,01Agent:  That's right.   How soon can you have them here?

15,01Pizza Man:  And everyone at the psychiatric hospital is an FBI agent?

15,01Agent:  That's right.  We've been here all day and we're starving.

15,01Pizza Man:   How are you going to pay for all of this?

15,01Agent:  I have my checkbook right here.

15,01Pizza Man:  And you're all FBI agents?

15,01Agent:  That's right.  Everyone here is an FBI agent.   Can you remember to
15,01bring the pizzas and sodas to the service entrance in the rear?   We have
15,01the front doors locked.

15,01Pizza Man:  I don't think so.
