15,01        Shao walked with the gaping steps and carefully measured speed of all
15,01cyb's.  His chip implants buzzed with excitement at the brawl he saw down the
15,01street, but he carefully held back the instinct to join the fight.  His eyes
15,01shift and rotated with the fast, deliberate force of the MicroVideo Optic(tm)
15,01implants he had acquired from the local chop shop. Touching his right temple,
15,01the implant began to record the fight.  He dreamt of getting that one story,
15,01that one vidream that would make him famous and more importantly rich.
15,01Approaching the fight he kept his implanted eye closely attached to the 
15,01important parts of the fight, the parts he knew people wanted to see.  The
15,01parts where people got hurt.  Where blood was shed.  Where thought gave over 
15,01to instinct, and where hidden desires and dreams came true.  Much like the
15,01ancient Roman arenas, the press's job was to keep people entertained.  And he
15,01did that, and did it well.  But this time it was more important.  The better
15,01he did, the more money he got.  Suddenely the LED screen on his visor flashed.

15,01        "Red?  This must be important!", he thought to himself, too curious to
15,01stay angry at being distracted any longer.  He hit his temple again, this time
15,01much faster and harder.  The sensor implants in his legs moved fast, detecting
15,01his blood pressure go up and his sweat glands working overtime.  His adrenal
15,01boosters in the parts of his legs that were still real turned to full power 
15,01and he ran towards the closest dataterm booth he saw.  Throwing the current
15,01occupant harshly out onto the street, he quickly pulled the plug from his
15,01wrist and jacked into the matrix.

15,01        "Drek!  What took you so long!", glared a large oblong polygon, being
15,01the image that the user chose to use in replacement of his actual image. The 
15,01matrix made you do this to keep the system speed up; With over 10 million 
15,01cyb's jacked in at one time, the system would get bogged down with high-res
15,01graphics.  The polygon was starting to turn rather red.  Shao's heat sensors
15,01were flaring, since even though there was no real heat the matrix was
15,01programmed to make you think there was.

15,01        "Sorry sir.  I was trying to cover a huge brawl when you called me.
15,01I'm sure you have something much more important then the fight though,"  he
15,01replied with a hint of sarcasm.

15,01        He seemed startled by this, as if he had never had someone say
15,01something sarcastic to him in his life.  However, he recovered very
15,01professionally.  "Shao, how would you like a job that'll guarantee you a
15,01million euro's?"

15,01        Shao thought to himself about this.  It was of course the chance of a
15,01lifetime; not many people got a chance to make 100 thousand euro's in their
15,01life, not to mention one million.  Of course, anything with that kind of
15,01oppurtunity had to be dangerous.  The question was, how dangerous?  Was it
15,01worth risking his life for a million?  The solo's, the lone hunters, the
15,01assasins, the mercenaries of the street did it all the time; and that was for
15,01a mere 10th of that.  Why shouldn't he try?  He decided to at least find out
15,01what it was about.

15,01        "Mr Tadin, I really appreciate the offer, but before I make a
15,01decision, what do I need to do for you?", inquired Shao.

15,01        "Well its rather simple, actually.  We know about your past with the
15,01net.  We know about you icing those deckers two years ago to get into the
15,01Eurodyne account.  This is my proposal: Get me some information and you will
15,01be rewarded.  Not only with money, but this could be a long term job, if you
15,01live long to enjoy it.  Mr. Takei, I am prepared to offer you five thousand
15,01euro's a week for the rest of your life if you take this job.  Think it over.
15,01You can reach me at Naktel information department.  Here's my card.  Call me
15,01when you make a decision."  And with that, he left.

15,01        "Wait a minute!" But it was too late.  Shao did a quick scan for
15,01anyone that might have followed him into the matrix and, finding nothing,
15,01departed.
