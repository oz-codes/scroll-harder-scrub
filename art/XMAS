15,01in the back bedroom, cuz that's how we live. 
15,01And Moms in her do-rag and me with my nine,

15,01He slid down the fire exscape smoove as a cat, 
15,01and busted the window wit' a b-ball bat.

15,01He cabbage patched his way back onto the roof 
15,01He jumped in his hooptie wit' rims made of chrome, 
15,01To tap that booty waitin' at home.
