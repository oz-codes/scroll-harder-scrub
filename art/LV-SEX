15,01It was nine o'clock on a Saturday night.
15,01She told me she was coming over.
15,01So I took a shower, got dressed and brushed my teeth.
15,01My parents weren't going to be home until Sunday morning.
15,01I was really nervous, I really liked her a lot.
15,01So I straightened up the living room, and my bedroom too.
15,01Everything looked immaculate.
15,01Just then I heard a knock at the door.  Was it her?
15,01I opened the door slowly.
15,01It was Deceit.
15,01He shoved me aside and pushed his way into the house.
15,01He climbed up the stairs and sat down on the couch.
15,01I told him to leave, but he ignored me and laughed.
15,01So I tried to throw him out, but he was stronger than me.
15,01So I figured I'd have to let him stay.
15,01Deceit and I watched MTV for awhile.
15,01Just then, the phone rang. Maybe it's her?
15,01I answered the phone slowly.
15,01It was Lust.
15,01He told me he would be over in five minutes.
15,01I started to think that this was getting out of hand.
15,01Four minutes and thirty-eight seconds later,
15,01Lust showed up at my door with Anger.
15,01I never really liked Anger, he was always a jerk to me.
15,01But I let them both in anyway.
15,01Deceit and Anger have been good friends since tenth grade.
15,01Lust started going through my parents' liquor cabinet.
15,01I looked out the window, a car was pulling up in the driveway
15,01I watched as Greed and Selfishness walked up to my door.
15,01I let them in, promising myself that they'd be the last.
15,01Deceit and Greed started wrecking the kitchen.
15,01I saw Lust hanging from the chandelier in the dining room.
15,01Anger and Selfishness were playing Twister in my bedroom.
15,01I heard glass shatter somewhere, and I smelled smoke.
15,01Just then, the doorbell rang.
15,01It was her.
15,01Everyone ran for cover.  I helped them hide.
15,01I answered the door like a gentleman. It was 9:25
15,01I hung up her coat and escorted her into the living room.
15,01We watched "Sleeping With the Enemy."
15,01I saw Selfishness dart out from behind the sofa.
15,01She got scared at one point, and hugged me tight.
15,01Lust came out of his hiding place and plopped down next to me
15,01I gave him a dirty look, but he stayed where he was.
15,01Deceit rolled out from under the coffee table.
15,01I held her close, and stroked her soft cheek.
15,01Greed's head popped up from behind the stereo.
15,01She put her head on my shoulder.
15,01I held her close and we started kissing.
15,01Lust kept staring at me.
15,01Selfishness lifted up my hand and put it on her breast.
15,01She didn't resist.  So I went along with it.
15,01Greed started whispering to me. "Go for it, man!"
15,01I wondered where Anger had run off to.
15,01Deceit made me tell her I loved her.
15,01I went to punch him, but he ducked.
15,01She must have believed it, because she told me the same thing
15,01Lust was getting fidgety.
15,01I took off her shirt.
15,01Selfishness started unbuttoning her jeans.
15,01Greed kept trying to push my hand down past her stomach.
15,01Suddenly, she bit her lip.
15,01She said, "stop."
15,01Just then I realized where Anger was.
15,01He had been hiding under the couch all this time.
15,01He jumped up and started choking her.
15,01Greed and Deceit went into hysterics.
15,01Selfishness was pissed.
15,01Lust sighed deeply, and gritted his teeth.
15,01She looked at me with pleading eyes.
15,01I got up and went into my room. I turned on the computer.
15,01I heard hideous laughter coming from the living room.
15,01"Let them have their way with her," I thought.
15,01And people wonder why my friends are such assholes.
