15,01After the rain, the beauty shows,
15,01the air is clean, the water flows.
15,01The sky is blue, full of bright white clouds,
15,01with animals playing, and talking aloud.
15,01The trees are glistening with beautiful leaves
15,01it's one grand sight, you cannot believe.
15,01The waves are pounding, on the endless shore,
15,01it makes you wish, the rain would come more.
15,01When you step outside, everything shines,
15,01the feeling you have, is one of a kind.
15,01You view this place, in which you live,
15,01as a place of happiness, where all forgive.
15,01You truly wish, this state never ends,
15,01but although it does, you know it will come again.
