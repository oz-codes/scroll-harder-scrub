15,011. Check it out!  ANSI in two consecutive packs!  That's a feat not done in two
15,01   years.
15,01   
15,012. Our  featured  artist  this  month is Stereophoenix,  aka SPX.   He's  got a
15,01   great interview for you to read,  and two images in the pack.  Come find out
15,01   about this interesting Aussie :)
15,01   
15,013. DJ Monkeyboy  did  a great  intoduction to using Maya for  our tutorial this
15,01   month.   So put those pens down and  get your pucks out  and get prepped for
15,01   doing some  3D work on a  $7500 (base price)  professional package.  You can
15,01   download a free Personal Learning Edition from
15,01   http://www.aliaswavefront.com/

15,014. Quick note to  excessively thank  Mynx and  Quantum-X  specifically, as well
15,01   as everyone else in iCE for  helping out with so much around  the home base.
15,01   The interview and tutorial html  were done by Mynx this month, and Quantum-X
15,01   has done  previous months.   You  guys all kick ass,  and it's  great to see
15,01   people kicking in to help the group!  
15,01   
15,015. We have a couple new members this month!  First up is Yonadaan,  a great new
15,01   hi-res artist who  survived our  terrible application process.   He's really
15,01   excited  to  finally  be  a part of iCE,  even though we made  him shave his
15,01   hands  and  hazed   him  a  bit  excessively.     Although  the  police  are
15,01   investigating,  we feel confident that they'll  never find the photos or the
15,01   name of the youth organization that was involved.

15,01   Next up we have  Allan!  No handle,  just Allan.  Allan ran on  the election
15,01   platform of  "Vote for me and  I'll make babies cry!",  which was a real hit
15,01   among the younger crowd.   He cleaned up at the  election booths and made it
15,01   into iCE.   And we're very glad  to have him with us!   Congrats  to both of
15,01   our new members this month!

15,016. We have to wave farewells to a  few people this month.   First, we are sadly
15,01   losing defected,  who is leaving to be with Raster  (using the name Psilic).
15,01   We certainly  wish him well  with Raster!   Andrew is a  great guy and we'll
15,01   miss him.  Good luck Andrew!
15,01   
15,01   Also departing is  Precurser,   whose website  (endeffect.com)  and life are
15,01   taking  too much of his time.   He's departing on the best of terms,  and we
15,01   will certainly miss him.

15,01   Finally,  Cadaverous Fate is leaving to join Noir.    It's sad to see people
15,01   go, but we only hope they're happy in their new homes.   Good luck everyone!

15,017. Although  we  don't  normally  discuss  group  policy in our  newsletters, I
15,01   figured I'ld explain here.   iCE has always had a rule against dual-grouping
15,01   in cases where the groups  overlap. In other words, if someone wants to join
15,01   iCE to release  artwork  and join  another group to  release poetry,  that's
15,01   fine.  But we ask that our members are  dedicate themselves to the group and
15,01   don't take membership lightly by "shopping around".   Every group can always
15,01   use help from their members -  get in the  one you want  and work to improve
15,01   it as much as you can.

15,018. We have a special  guest  release this month from  Greg and Jito.   We don't
15,01   normally release  non-iCE art in the pack,  but this one was special.   Greg
15,01   and Jito  are  such  fantastic artists  and  it  turned  out so well that we
15,01   thought  we  should  give it  some extra  publicity.   So check out Greg and
