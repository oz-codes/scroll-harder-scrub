00,01In the cold desolate state of existance
00,01The poor man travels down the desperate path
00,01Toward the bright light, blinding his eyes
00,01The intense cold, the gnawing hunger
00,01Fills him to the extremes of his being
00,01He falls - and the numbness overcomes him
00,01Shielding him from the wind and madness
00,01His head strikes hard ground and he
00,01Scrambles to see what he has found
00,01Clearing away the debris reveals to him
00,01A lonely tomb, encrypted with a single verse
00,01That couplet which was his dying thought
00,01Left his lips and escaped to the world:

00,01"Hark thee stranger, come forth....
00,01Another victim to The Great White North..."
