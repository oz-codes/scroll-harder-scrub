15,01   They are among us, the invisible walkers of another
15,01place.  I do not know where they come from, or why they are
15,01here, and I seem to be the only one who can see their shaded
15,01visages prowling about.  One moment I see them scurrying
15,01across a hallway, or lurking in a crowded room, and the next
15,01moment they are gone.  I do not know what they are doing,
15,01but I am sure they must be stopped.
15,01   
15,01   The sound of the music lulled Mitchell's mind into a
15,01lessened awareness, the sonic vibrations relaxing his weary
15,01mind.  Mitchell took the headphones off. The sounds of the
15,01voices echoing in the hall rushed into his ears. His mind
15,01screamed in shock.  He felt as if he had just awakened from
15,01unconsciousness, and reality came back to him in small
15,01parts.  "I'm in a hallway," he thought, "there are people
15,01carrying on conversations around me.  A small group of
15,01people are staring at me laughing.  Oh yes, now I remember
15,01why I must get up:  the restroom."
15,01   Mitchell Lewis stood and walked toward the stairs to the
15,01lower floor, the floor where the bathrooms were.  Mitchell
15,01was sixteen, 5 foot 11, medium build, weighing about 165
15,01pounds.  He started down the stairs slowly, because he had a
15,01sprained ankle, and therefore could not walk with the
15,01greatest of ease.  An ominous looking figure popped into
15,01existence right in front of Mitchell, and then disappeared
15,01into thin air.  He leaped back, landing on his bad ankle,
15,01and yelping from pain and fright.  The hallway burst into
15,01laughter, and Mitchell sheepishly hurried down to the
15,01restroom to take care of some urgent business.  After he was
15,01finished relieving himself of his burdens, he limped over to
15,01a mirror to fix his hair.  As he looked at the mirror he
15,01noticed the same evil figure that had scared him in the
15,01hall.  Mitchell squeezed a particularly troublesome pimple,
15,01and a small white mass landed on the mirror right where his
15,01pursuer's face was reflected.  "Take that you freak,"
15,01Mitchell shouted as he burst into laughter.
15,01   
15,01   Am I the only one who can see them?
15,01   
15,01   "Mental Hospital Patients - Case Histories," the
15,01computer screen read as Mitchell browsed through the
15,01selections.  "Ah ha! 'Dark Figures - Paranoia' that's what
15,01I'm looking for," Lewis thought.
15,01   "What?" Asked a library attendant, "can I help you use
15,01the index?"
15,01   "Sorry, I didn't know I was talking," Mitchell replied.
15,01   Mitchell read through sixteen articles before finding
15,01what he was looking for:  "Patient suffers from extreme
15,01paranoia.  He sees 'Dark Figures' which pop in and out of
15,01existence."  Mitchell searched his pocket for thirty cents
15,01to make a copy of the article but came up empty, so he
15,01quickly tore out the three page article and left the
15,01library.  Scanning the end of the article, Mitchell read,
15,01"Nick Fredrickson - Patient at Dearbrook Mental Institute,
15,01Shreveport, LA."
15,01   "Good, only a three hour drive," Mitchell thought as he
15,01ran out to his car.
15,01   The drive passed more quickly than expected, for at 105
15,01miles per hour, it only took Lewis and hour and a half to
15,01get to Shreveport.  While running into Dearbrook, Mitchell's
15,01dark nemesis appeared to the right of him.  Letting out a
15,01shriek, Mitchell leaped away from the glowing green dagger
15,01that the figure swung at him.  A small group of orderlies
15,01smiled at each other, "Looks like a new patient," Mitchell
15,01heard one of them say.
15,01   Mitchell, still shocked by the attack, looked back up,
15,01shielding himself from another blow, but, to his surprise,
15,01he found that the wraith had disappeared.  Lewis then
15,01noticed a dull, aching pain in his right arm.  Staring down
15,01at his arm, Mitchell saw a deep gash with no blood pouring
15,01out of it.  Studying the gash more closely revealed that the
15,01surrounding skin had turned a shadowy black.  Mitchell
15,01touched the wound and winced in agony as his right arm
15,01throbbed with pain.  "I've got to get to him before the same
15,01thing happens again," Lewis said to himself as he hobbled up
15,01the ramp to the door, his ankle having been hurt again in
15,01the proceedings.
