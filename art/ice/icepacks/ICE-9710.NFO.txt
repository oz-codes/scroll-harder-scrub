15,011.  Well, well.   Another month has  passed bringing you the  1st wonder of the
15,01cyber underground, the iCEPACK.   As if you didn't already know that.   A month
15,01laced with  high-quality VGA from some talented newcomers,  as well as some new
15,01visual sweets from the veterans.

15,012.  Unfortunately,  this month has a sad overtone to it.   iCE is very sorry to
15,01announce the passing of iCE VGA artist Levi Dedi,  aka Night Daemon.   Levi was
15,01an amazing  artist who managed to make everyone around him smile.   Levi was an
15,01integral part of iCE,  and we feel that some of the fabric that  makes us whole
15,01is gone forever.  Levi will be missed dearly.  Much work has gone into tracking
15,01down the last  remaining incomplete  works by Night Daemon,  as well as tribute
15,01material from  his friends from all over the scene.   We have posted some of it
15,01to http://shalom.ice.org on the web.   If you'd like to contribute,  we welcome
15,01it - just email rmaker@ice.org and Rainmaker will take care of it.   God speed,
15,01Levi.  Rest in peace.

15,013.  The iCE  nuclear arms  inspection  team scrubbed  behind a few  corners and
15,01plucked up  a few grimy new radioactive  artists!   iCE welcomes  Poweronx  and
15,01Darkmage to the VGA team.   These guys are  excellent - don't  miss their  work
15,01as featured in the pack this month.   iCE would also like to welcome Fluor back
15,01to the group this month, rejoining the ANSI logomafia team.  A big sloppy happy
15,01welcome to all!

15,014.  The iCE chief security officer managed to  contain all attempts to flee the
15,01starbase this month.  Nobody got away, but several disgruntled  members made it
15,01to the brig, where they are served cold oatmeal and tap water.  One of the more
15,01outspoken was an infuriated Friar Tuck,  who came out of hiding to  lead one of
15,01the incursions.   "How the hell am I supposed  to survive without nachos?!", he
15,01spat.  Indeed!

15,015.  Newly  psychoanalyzed Information  Systems  Director Lickbert  came  to the
15,01podium and  reported that Sanctuary(tm) will be  delayed due to some logistical
15,01problems.  It will return shortly.  Keep your eyes here fore more.  But the iCE
15,01IRC server, irc.ice.org, has returned to X-Net full force this month.  Check it
15,01out if you're looking for an elite new network.

15,016.  Recently there  has been a  disturbing amount of people  who feel that they
15,01can steal the original copyrighted  artwork from the iCE web page and use it on
15,01their own.   We would like to help stem the tide  a bit by publicy stating that
15,01under NO  circumstances is iCE  artwork on the  web site,  or previously on the
15,01web site, to be used on another  web site without the expressed written consent
15,01of iCE  and the iCE  senior staff.   All images are  Copyright (C) iCE  and the
15,01originating artist.

15,017.  Another high-quality month that you've come to expect from iCE.   While the
15,01quantity is a  bit under the normal level,  certain  unfortunate  circumstances
15,01beyond  our  control caught most  of our attention  this month.   The heartfelt
15,01feelings and strength that  the group showed during  the tragedy this month was
15,01inspiring.   And I'd also like to say  how wonderful it was to see that,  for a
15,01little  while,  the scene was  one big family.   Maybe  that  isn't such  a dim
15,01possibility after all.   I'd like to dedicate this pack and the rest of 1997 to
15,01the memory of Levi Dedi.   This was  a good pack,  but there's  one person  who
15,01never got to see it.   Please check out  http://shalom.ice.org,  and help us to
15,01build as much into it as we can.  It's still a work in progress,  and hopefully
15,01it always will be...  See you next month.
