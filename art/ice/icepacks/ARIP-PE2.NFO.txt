15,01                   by PRiMAL ENERGY,  formerly Tempus Thales



15,01    Ok, lemme see here... STiLE is complaining just because I edited an ANSi of
15,01Tempus Thales.  Haha, sure... ok, for one thing, why in the world would I take
15,01an ANSi made by an artist that well known, and edit it without admitting it?
15,01Especially one that had been around for so long, was seen so many times, and
15,01had been released as copyrighted material by iCE Advertisements(tm)?  Sheesh!
15,01C'mon, of course I edited it.  To think that I would claim I'd drawn on my
15,01own... that is total ludicris!

15,01           Some other things here also.., STiLE said that I had showed him some
15,01of my work when I called his board, and that was true.  BUT what he neglected
15,01to mention was that the work I showed him was done a little over a month and
15,01a half ago.  SO, STiLE's proof about my ansi talent is probably justifiable,
15,01being as how there is no way I could improve so quickly in a month and a half.
15,01This just goes to show that anyone who thinks I really drew that ansi on my own
15,01needs a serious reality adjustment...  I'm so bad at fonts, I had to add some
15,01fonts drawn by other guys in ACiD!

15,01 And also, when I had called, I had expressed an interest in joining
15,01iCE.  That was around early July.  That is also when I showed him the art I
15,01did from a month and a half ago (near the end of May).  He took a look at my
15,01art and said it looked good.  He said and I quoute, "From the looks of these,
15,01you will be an awesome artist!" <not an exact quoute because I hadn't stopped
15,01to screen image it because I never thought I would be able to defend that>. He
15,01also said I would be possibly be able to join iCE in about a month when I got
15,01good. I didn't like that whole waiting to get good enough to be in iCE thing.
15,01I was happy at EViL but it was too small for my licking, and we didn't get
15,01enough exposure. So what did I do, boys and girls?  After being turned down by
15,01iCE, I marched right over to my computer, called The Dark Society and logged on.

15,01I filed out the new user stuff and was pulled into chat by SHArP.  He saw me put

15,01in my New user msg that I was an artist and possibly interested in joining ACiD
15,01after I couldn't get into iCE.  After he took a look at my original <and once
15,01again OVER A MONTH OLD, remember, I had improved greatly by this time as you
15,01will see by the ansi for TDS> ANSi's I had done, and said he licked them. He
15,01then gave me an assignment.  I took it on quickly as it was a chance I dont
15,01think I would have gotten again if he didn't see some of my new and improved
15,01work after a month of hard work and practice.

15,01        I logged off his board, and got to work immediately on selecting the
15,01ANSi.  I edited the old ansi till about 12:30 am and then said screw it, I will
15,01finish editing it later.  I then went to bed, exhausted from removing white
15,01blocks and tree bark.  At about 8 am I woke up and once again began edit it some

15,01more.  I worked till about 5pm <or was it 4?, either way it was all day> and
15,01then I was finally finished editing.  I then called Dark Society and showed
15,01SHARp what I had transformed.  He like it, and say, "Welcome to ACiD" with much
15,01smile -> :).  Once I was a proud ACiD member, I then edited one of Cardiac
15,01Arrest's (if anyone doesn't remember him, he was an iCE artist for about 8
15,01months) ansi's and used his ACiD font because it was so good, and after finally
15,01getting a font from Hannible Lecter (if anyone doesn't remember him, he was an
15,01iCE artist for about 2 days), and my first ACiD ansi was completed and ready to
15,01be officially released by them in the Aquisition!

15,01                               I then immediatley got to work on my second ACiD
15,01ansi <which will be an original this time, so STiLE can't complain anymore about

15,01my talent!>.  I then learned, after calling Dark Society, that STiLE had called
15,01up ShARP and was saying something about me ripping the ansi from Tempus.  Once
15,01again, to the ladies and gentlemen of the seen, why in the hell would I rip off
15,01an ansi made by someone in iCE?  I only rip off ansi's (actually, fonts) from
15,01ACiD artists!  And, especially an artist as well known as Tempus Thales, or any
15,01other ansi for that matter!  The truth is that I DIDN'T rip it off, I merely
15,01edited an old iCE ansi, and I'm in ACiD, so there's nothing wrong with that.

15,01        I can only assume that STiLE was disgruntled that I settled on ACiD
15,01after getting turned down by iCE, maybe he wanted me in iCE?  Who knows. I only
15,01did what I thought was best for me, and ACiD happened to be a good second
15,01choice.  So like you can see I joined ACiD, and I'm proud to be a member of a
15,01group with such integrity.
