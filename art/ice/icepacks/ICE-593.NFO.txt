15,011.  Once again, iCE was faced with yet another interesting turn of events
15,01    during the month of May.  (Hey! We're building CHARACTER! :->)
15,01    Senior Staff Member Shihear Kallizad became one of the shortest
15,01    reigning Senior Staff Members this month, quitting after only about
15,01    three weeks of service.  He stated a number of reasons, such as
15,01    giving iCE a bad name.  However, what many did not know is that
15,01    Shihear did a lot for the group in many ways, and he'll be missed.
15,01    Most people only saw his posts and came up with a negative view of
15,01    his attitude, but iCE perhaps would have folded if it weren't for his
15,01    efforts.  Good luck in your ventures, Shihear.

15,012.  Because of the void left by Shihear, Midnight Sorrow offered his
15,01    services as Senior Staff Member.  A charismatic personality, MS
15,01    has been with iCE since the GRiM merger in early September 1992.
15,01    Metal Head and myself decided to appoint him to the third staff
15,01    spot.  Welcome aboard, MS!

15,013.  iCE would like to recognize the efforts of Quazar.  In addition to
15,01    being one of our best logo makers, he has suddenly improved his
15,01    full-ANSI talents.  Besides all of that, he has helped the group
15,01    in MANY other ways.  Kudos Quazar!

15,014.  Toxic Freak says that he liked to be listed in the "What's New"
15,01    column, so we're listing him here.  Hi Toxic!  NICE Headers -
15,01    Paintbrush is very original.

15,015.  iCE would like to announce the promotions of Joker and CyberX,
15,01    former trial artists.  Their works just blew us away so, hope
15,01    to see more soon from both of you!

15,016.  iCE would like to recognize Mushroom's efforts in Hi-Res VGA.
15,01    A member of iCE since the September 92 GRiM Merger, Mushroom
15,01    has pumped out VGAs in the double-digits!  High Quality
15,01    rendering is hard to find.  Great job, Mushroom.

15,017.  iCE would like to welcome some new artists to iCE!  They are:
15,01    Nailz, Hannibal Lektor, Slam Dunk, Final Descendant, Morbid, and
15,01    Wire Tap.  (whew!)

15,018.  To our fans, and all those sticking with iCE - congratulations,
15,01    you're with the art scene's finest - not just in art, but in
15,01    morality and loyalty.  Too bad we can't say the same for others,
15,01    even some we considered friends.

15,019.  Once again, the VGA team has pumped out some great stuff.
15,01    Excellent Job, guys!  Next month is touted to be the best of all!

15,0110. iCE is sponsoring a new made-for-TV-film: Tank - Where Are You Now?

15,0111. Articles are steadily being collected for the iCE Magazine.  After the
15,01    first issue is released, it's scheduled to come out about every three
15,01    months.  A monthly schedule was discussed but it didn't seem practical,
15,01    first, the pressure would be immense, and second, we didn't feel there
15,01    would be enough to report every month.  The first issue will concern iCE,
15,01    and consecutive issues will be more general with a section about iCE.

15,01    While it isn't possible for everyone in the group to produce the
15,01    magazine (the whole 'too many chiefs, not enough indians' thing), we're
15,01    trying to include as many iCE members as possible and get as much input
15,01    from them.  Please leave any questions, suggestions, or articles on
15,01    Sanctuary(tm), Infinite Darkness, or Altars of Madness, or leave
15,01    Felony Netmail to Force Ten and/or Tempus Thales.

15,0112. If any iCE member has any boxes of Charleston Chew, please send them
15,01    to Eight Ball.  He feels deprived of them.

15,0113. Welcome to The Retarted Warrior, who wrote some excellent poetry
15,01    in this month's literary division!  Nice job RW!

15,0114. Next month, the memberlist will have a slightly new format.
15,01    In addition to the standard somewhat-active member listing,
15,01    members who have become lazy, dormant, hibernative, sleepy,
15,01    and downright deadweight will be listed in a 'shitlist' type
15,01    section on the end of the memberlist rather than being ignored.
