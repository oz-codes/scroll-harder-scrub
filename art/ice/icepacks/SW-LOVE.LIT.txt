15,01                                Love "Ahh shucks"

15,01A sight as beautiful as heaven, as pure as a dove;
15,01could this be what it's like, to be in love?
15,01Her loves so tender, her thoughts so kind;
15,01I can't get this beauty, out of my mind.
15,01I try so hard, I pray so much.
15,01My only wish, is to feel her touch.
15,01Her dreamy eyes, my wicked desire;
15,01If they met, what would aspire?
15,01I may never find out, I may never reach my goal;
15,01The only answer lies, within her soul.
15,01If she found out, of my only want;
15,01Would this beauty... just turn and run?
15,01Would she laugh, in full surpise?
15,01Or would she give me, the ultimate prize?

15,01If only she knew,
15,01If only she cared...

15,01This pain in my heart,
15,01can no longer faire.
