15,011.  Egoteq  hit  the nail  on  the  head  this month  with   his  hirez  piece,
15,01"iCE  V2: Ready To  Fly".  We couldn't have  said it more accurately!  With our
15,01server back online and a backup mirror being implemented now, iCE V2 is winding
15,01down into its final stages.  Some text re-writes, a few graphics here and there
15,01and  the implementation  of the last couple  of interfaces  and it's  go  time!

15,012. Great  member  news this month!  Recently added  member  BMXMEN  is  already
15,01making  big waves; he  is working on the 3D portion  of a new Red Man video for
15,01MTV.  You can check out his work this month in the vga portion of the iCE Pack.
15,01DaVinci  was chosen as a  winner in Adobe's "Give The  President A New Haircut"
15,01competition.  Making the CEO of Adobe look just a little more punk proved to be
15,01too  much for the  judges to  ignore.  And in the "New Member  Kicking Ass(tm)"
15,01department, last-month inductee Funbaby was  seen tearing it up when  his image
15,01was  chosen as a MetaCreations  Image Of The Day.  Not  just any monkey  can be
15,01chosen for something like that, it takes an iCEMonkey( (C) Darkmage )!

15,013.  Three comes before four.  *applause*

15,014.  About this time in the newsletter,  we like to tell everyone who joined and
15,01who quit and  who we had to neuter a second time.  However, we  don't feel like
15,01doing that quite yet.

15,014.  We have  heard your requests!  Yes, the  whining and  bitching has  finally
15,01pierced  our sound-proofed ear  plugs and we can now  hear you shrill and clear
15,01saying "smaller packs".  We realize that the 30 second difference between 4.5mb
15,01instead of 4.0mb is time sorely  torn away from special "wacky" time, and we're
15,01making  inroads to accomodate  you, the viewer.  The iCE staff  will be using a
15,01complicated formula to ensure that iCE high-resolution pieces are optimized for
15,01downloading, and heaven forbid, not viewing.

15,015.  Inazone said  that FOS 13 will be inspired by a recent experience involving
15,01women of large caliber, social gatherings, and  hormone-enraged females yelling
15,01obscenities regarding sexual intercourse.  Sick, just sick.

15,016.  Still not in the mood to share that information...

15,017.  Man, some months you're just not funny.  I think Seinfeld had that problem.

15,018.  Frequently.

15,019.  While we're laying in bed at night, trying  to get some rest, we often hear
15,01the delighted and  joyful screams of esctacy as Senior Staff Sinned Sould views
15,01another  ass-kicking iCE Pack.  Many of these throes of  passion are because of
15,01our  VGA crew placing  those pixels in oh-so provocative  manners.  Perhaps you
15,01too wake  people at  night with your  screams?  Would you like  to instill this
15,01same effect in others?  Jamie McCarter wants to make  that a reality with a new
15,01series  of 3D  tutorials.  Want to  learn how iCE guys  do some of their stuff?
15,01Just email icestaff@ice.org and we'll do our best to lose it!

15,0110.  iCE is proud to announce this month that we have a NEW drawing program! It
15,01is almost  ready for release  and is VERY close to being  made public.  It will
15,01support all the popular formats (xbin/adf/idf/bin) and  will include ANSImation
15,01support  in a later  release!  We also  took into account  that since the Linux
15,01Penguin is  slowly taking over  the world, we should support  Linux.  And so it
15,01will be.

15,0111.  Did we say _lose_ it?  Ha  Ha  Ha!  That  was a typo.  We would never lose
