00,01Open the black gates and slowly step inside.
00,01Watch yourself...you may not be able to withstand
00,01The power.  The magical splendor of this
00,01Mystical realm overcomes all who bathe in its might.
00,01A beautiful woman comes up to you, kisses you deeply,
00,01And whispers in your ears: "Don't ever leave..."
00,01You hear the siren song and the waves crashing in
00,01The distance..."Utopia" you sigh, and revel in
00,01The magnificence.  You sit back and relax because
00,01You have finally found your heaven - far and
00,01Deep within the confines of the Black Gate.......
