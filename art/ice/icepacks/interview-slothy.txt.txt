15,01iCE: Tell us a bit about yourself - first name, age, occupation, hobbies,
15,01     etc.

15,01slothy: I'm Jon, but everyone just calls me Slothy. I'm 24, and I'm a PC
15,01        game programmer.  Aside from keeping tiles.ice.org and www.ice.org
15,01        happy, I also help Root88 manage the day-to-day operations of
15,01        running iCE.

15,01        In the non-digital world, I have a cute little car
15,01        (http://www.slothy.com/sterling_10.jpg) that I like to work on on
15,01        most weekends.  I'm also obsessive about music, and I occasionally
15,01        read those book things - but only books about copyright and patent
15,01        law.
15,01 
15,01iCE: Where are you from? Have you lived anywhere else?

15,01slothy: I'm from Sonoma Valley right now - just north of San Francisco.  I
15,01        just moved out here from Virginia, where I have lived since I was
15,01        7.  I was working from home in Virginia, but my company tightened
15,01        the screws and got me to move out here to work at the office with
15,01        the rest of the company.  It's quite a big change for me to be out
15,01        here.  I haven't been around as much recently, since I've been
15,01        trying to get out and meet some new people out here.  But once I
15,01        get off this ghastly 56k at home I'm sure I'll be around more -
15,01        especially since I get hours where I'm not "at work" now that I 
15,01        don't work from home.

15,01iCE: Is your cousin really an astronaut?

15,01slothy: She rules.  (http://www.slothy.com/sts-112/)
15,01 
15,01iCE: If you could live on any other planet, which would it be, and why?

15,01slothy: I think I'd like to live in a black hole, because I could keep a
15,01        lot of things within reaching distance.
15,01 
15,01iCE: How long have you been a member of iCE?

15,01slothy: I joined in late 1993 as a member of the horrific iCE Trial program.
15,01        I was one of the only ones to make it out of iCE Trial - TooN GooN
15,01        being another notable survivor.  I was promoted to a full iCE Member
15,01        by Shaggy on Christmas Eve when I showed him my Hell's Gate ansi
15,01        (back in the days when you'd call someone and have them type ATA
15,01        while you typed ATD and then coordinate when you'd both pick up and
15,01        hang up the modems to talk again :).  When he saw that ansi, he
15,01        said, "Wait, YOU did this?" and it was history after that.
15,01 
15,01iCE: So what was the deal with iCE Trial?

15,01slothy: Essentially, it started as a great idea. You find promising artists
15,01        and kind of "take them under your wing" until they are good enough
15,01        to release in the pack. Ideally they could get help from the many
15,01        members of iCE to help them hone their skills.

15,01        In reality, it failed in almost every aspect.  It was decided that
15,01        iCE Trial would release their own packs - to reduce the penalty for
15,01        joining iCE Trial as opposed to being in a separate second-tier art
15,01        group.  
15,01        Since those packs still were affiliated with iCE, many iCE members
15,01        were embarrassed by them.  As a result, they treated the Trial guys
15,01        as second-class citizens and wouldn't associate with them much.  So
15,01        the Trial guys got insults from the rest of the scene for being
15,01        essentially wannabe-member fanboys who "sucked", and in their own
