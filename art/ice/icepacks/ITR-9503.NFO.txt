15,01       Hi de ho hum, YES! your not going nut's ICE TRIAL is back!!!
15,01       With the recent insurgence of artist in the Scene, ICE felt
15,01       the need to bring up the standard's one more time and weed 
15,01       thru the bad apples & they have apointed me, Deeply Disturbed
15,01       to head up ICE trial, meaning i will no longer be releasing in
15,01       the ICE packs, my work as of late has been below par, and it 
15,01       was put to a unanimous vote that i should bring up my SKILL's.

15,01       Some of the artist featured in this pack have potential, ie:
15,01       Somm's and Red Leader, they will probably be brought up to full
15,01       ICE membership status next month if they do as well as this month.
15,01       But alas, some of the artist are having trouble finding there 
15,01       SKILL's, so i am sad to say: For not being up to ICE TRIAL 
15,01       standards Prisoner#1 has been released, we wish him luck in his
15,01       future endeavour's (rumor is he is heading up the ansi division in
15,01       GRIP/AD now). Also joining up with ITR this month, long time ACID
15,01       artist VISION, altho VS is having lots of trouble figuring out
15,01       how to actually draw, we keep him around because he's got the
15,01       sweetest little ass you have EVER seen. Terminator 2 comes
15,01       over from the death of Unchained, T2 or mr. Ed as i like to call
15,01       him will give us a well needed boost in the old ansi dept. 
15,01       although last i heard from him he wasnt sure if he could cut it
15,01       in ITR, enormously hard to believe rumors state that T2 is
15,01       thinking of also joining GRIP/AD (fear them) well wherever your 
15,01       thinking of going mr. Ed you know your real home is here.

15,01       Late breaking news: Stone the Crow after finding out that 
15,01       i was catholic (you cant get away from us christians there stc) left
15,01       ITR, leaving behind his ansis, since we had a shortage we decided
15,01       to release what he sent us, i think he now has formed an anti
15,01       religion group called "Eat my holy shorts" hrmm well good luck 
15,01       to you... And god bless ya.

15,01       To Help us coordinate things we have Aquired Cavalier, now Cav 
15,01       long time Scene activist for the freedom of #ansi and all who 
15,01       dwell in his presence, will help us attain the level of excelence
15,01       that only ICE trial can get to, Last i heard Cavalier was already
15,01       hot on the heels of none other then COOL-T yes you heard it here
15,01       1st, so stay tuned for more info on the COOL-T situation.

15,01       So thats it, before i go a comment on this months pack: Im sort 
15,01       of sorry that the quality of ansi wich is featured in this months
15,01       pack isnt really up to the standards that ITR has set for the 
15,01       scene. We are hoping that next month we finaly pull together as 
15,01       brothers and bring back ITR to what it once was, Glory days are 
15,01       coming back.
