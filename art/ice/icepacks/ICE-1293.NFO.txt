00,01  1.  Biggest change in iCE recently is the newest Senior Staffer: Raistlin

00,01  2.  Our long time Canadian HQ: Alters of Madness, is unfortunatly down.
15,01      00A new CHQ will be decided on sometime in January.

00,01  3.  ANSi-wise we have some farmiliar faces joining the group and becoming
15,01      00reactive.  First is R.Noble who has joined iCE after the disbanding of
15,01      00Mirage (Playing 'Taps').  Second is Tank, and ex-ACiD member, quite a
15,01      00vetern of the scene.  Third is Riothamusm, who released a fuckin' cool
15,01      00ansi after a loooooong period of absence, hope to see more from you guy :)
15,01      00Lastly is Napalm who suprisingly has come back to release a few ANSi's,
15,01      00but due to the fate of AoM I was not able to get his artwork for this
15,01      00pack.. sorry guy.

00,01  4.  Well let's see, iCE has been pretty stable this month.. only person to
15,01      00leave being Isreafel from the lit division.. have fun in GOTHiC :)

00,01  5.  Big news for anyone who is a fan of the Demo scene, especially if you are
15,01      00a fan of the music in the demo scene.  C.C.Catch of Renaissance is
15,01      00now also a composer for iCE.  Check out his first release under the
15,01      00iCE name in this pack.  It's called 'Spiritual Dance'.  For those of
15,01      00you not familiar with the demo music scene.  Here's the time to do so..

00,01  6.  Look for the iCE Music Disk, HOPEFULLY out in Febuary '94.

00,01  7.  Some new directors have been added to help organize the group, here they
15,01      00are with a short introduction:
15,01        00Sonoma: Helps with keeping in cotact with members
15,01        00Trixter: VGA Director
15,01        00Xerobe: iCN (iNSANiTY Corperate Network) Director
15,01        00Bane: Courier Director

00,01  8.  Last but not least, iCE Trial has now become SKiLL/iCE Trial.  SKiLL/iCE
15,01      00Trial is not a section of iCE, but instead a fully functional group for
15,01      00the Trial artists.  The head is SKiLL/iCE Trial is Devil's Spawn, and
15,01      00the HQ BBS is South of Hell.

00,01  9.  Some small new features in K-View.. first is that there is now a wrap
15,01      00around selection that will make the 320x200 wrap around as all 640x480
15,01      00viewers do.  It is also MUCH faster.  The other minor thing is that you
15,01      00can now start up K-View with a switch such as '*.ANS' and K-View will
15,01      00load with the extension .ANS being used.  And as Isreafel said on CCi:
15,01                    00"Heaven is defined by 'KV *.ANS'" :)

00,01 10.  Thats all I can think of, so enjoy the pack...

15,01                                                          00metalhed@phantom.com
