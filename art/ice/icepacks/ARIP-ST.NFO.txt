15,01Ahem.  Load up your handy gif viewer and take a look at the gif that I made.
15,01On the left is the PITT ansi by PRIMAL ENERGY of ACID, and on the right is the
15,01PITT ansi by TEMPUS THALES of ICE.  Tempus made his ansi first, around November
15,01of 1992.. Primal Energy's ansi came out just a few days ago.  If you are stupid
15,01you may not realize that HE RIPPED Tempus's ansi!  It's TOTALLY clear that he
15,01did and anyone that doesn't see it must be retarded.  I was on the phone with
15,01SHARP of ACID a few days ago and he told me that it was NOT ripped, because you
15,01can only do PITT in one perspective.  I didn't say anything after he said that
15,01and I changed the subject... No use to get into an argument over something like
15,01this, since obviously it wasn't Sharp's fault.. But that fact is that PE did
15,01rip the ansi off.  I would get a very VERY big laugh if it actually was
15,01included in next month's ACiD aquisition.

15,01Here's excatly what I know about Primal Energy..

15,01He called up my board one day when his alisa was Huma Dragonbone, and he was
15,01currently a member of an art group named EViL.  We started talking and I was
15,01giving him some tips on shading etc, when I ask him if I can be an EViL dist
15,01site.. He says sure why not, and then tells me that he is going to change his
15,01alias and if I could give him some suggestions he'd appreciate it.  So I
15,01suggested Primal Energy.  That alias was in use over a year ago in the 416 area
15,01code, but I really liked it back then, so I suggested it to him and he liked
15,01it.  Heck, he's in 804 or somewhere and doesn't call many 416 boards so I
15,01doubted that it would make a difference.

15,01Bamn!  He's in ACiD Now..

15,01One day he calls my board and posts his sig with ACiD.  He says to me that he's
15,01joined ACiD now, and that if I want him in iCE he'd come.  I didn't want him
15,01in iCE.  Nothing personal, but I don't feel he was iCE quality, so I told him
15,01that he should stick with ACiD and be loyal and he'll get really good soon.
15,01Personally, I don't have any bad feelings about ACiD or any of their members,
15,01and I feel that ACiD has a lot of young artists, more-so then iCE, and that 
15,01he'd fit better in ACID.  I've taken the loyalty to include some of his work
15,01which was done just a week ago that he showed me before he changed his handle
15,01to PE.  If you notice, well..er.. I don't want to be mean, but if he got
15,01struck by lightning and got some amazing super-duper ansi abilility overnight,
15,01there is no WAY he could have drawn that pitt ansi.  Now, as you can clearly
15,01see it was ripped off.  What should the consequences be?  I think that's the
15,01decision for Sharp or another acid staff member, since it makes ACiD look
15,01really bad.

15,01I just hope that I've shed some truth on what really happened.  Ripping ansi's
15,01is really (pardon the word) lame!  Come on!  More people should try and draw
15,01original stuff then comic characters, but blatently ripping an ansi off of
15,01another artist is one of the worst things you can do in the art scene!

15,01- STiLE.. iCE Vice President.
