15,011.  We welcome several new members this month:

15,01    As some of you may know, iCE recently obtained the services of some
15,01    excellent European ANSI talents.  The former group CORP has joined
15,01    iCE, bringing Genesis, Sparr, and Wiz to the iCE Team.  CORP, from
15,01    Finland, was well known for the remarkably high quality ANSI talents
15,01    from Europe, a land dominated by the fast paced ascii Amiga scene.

15,01    Genesis will act as the European VP of iCE and will coordinate things
15,01    out of our new European Headquarters, Baudville.

15,01    Welcome, welcome!

15,01    Toxic Freak, from the famed northern sector up in the 'frozen wastelands
15,01    of canada' (quote copyright 1992 paul muad'dib. all rights reserved :>)
15,01    is perhaps one of the brightest new talents in the ANSI scene.  He began
15,01    drawing ANSI about three weeks ago and has shown remarkable improvement.
15,01    In the future, watch for him being one of the best in the world.

15,01    Leper Messiah, formerly of Spit, has joined the group after a pretty
15,01    impressive iCE Trial period which showed remarkable improvement.
15,01    Working with Shihear Kallizad, Leper has become quite a prominent
15,01    artist.

15,01    In the coding section of iCE, we welcome two new members!  The first,
15,01    The Shadow, formerly of ACiD, has joined up with iCE to work with
15,01    Eight Ball and Mad Hatter up in Ontario on VGAs/Demos.  The second,
15,01    Ford Prefect, is a coder from Israel.  Welcome aboard!

15,01    Finally, another late welcome to Metal Head, Senior Staff member.
15,01    He was left out in the December pack's .NFO so I figured we'll greet
15,01    him TWICE in a row.  Do-verrrrr....

15,012.  If anyone was confused about the former 'iCE Division' ideals and
15,01    controversy, the situation was settled nicely and the artists in
15,01    question are warmly welcome in iCE.  To those who don't know what
15,01    I'm talking about, don't worry about it, it's too long a story...

15,013.  Well, February was supposedly Taking Care Of It's Own Month, but
15,01    that seemed to just spur less artwork :>.. Actually, a number of
15,01    artists had some distractions this month due to midterms or school
15,01    or .... Valentine's Day.  Damn women want February to be Valentine's
15,01    Month.  :>...

15,014.  In a remarkable event, iCE's very own Quick Silver has thanked
15,01    HIMSELF for ripping Slum's font.  While it was obvious that Slum's
15,01    fonts were being ripped left and right, this is a precedent setting
15,01    event.

15,015.  This month's iCEPACK embarks on a new level of art.  Now we include
15,01    a plethora of literature and music as well as visual art.
15,01    Welcome to Israfel as a poet.

15,016.  Rivendell, the iCE WORLD HEADQUARTERS, can be reached at 201-808-5574.
15,01    (cheap-ass plug)

15,017.  Tempus Thales and Midnight Sorrow last week have started up a fight,
15,01    where they now hold great animosity towards each other.  The fight began
15,01    regarding Tempus' desiring to be a site for ESP, a techno-music group.
15,01    Midnight decided that Tempus would just try to recruit ESP members to
15,01    iCE.  To qualm any fears, we had no intention of this and are sorry for
15,01    any confusion.

15,018.  .siht daer t'nod esaelP

15,019.  Yes, someone NEW is doing the iCEPACK! Me! :) Only temporary...

15,0110.  Finally, as some of you might have noticed, the active member-list has
15,01     been trimmed drastically.  Artists may have simply been left off due to
15,01     non-production in a few months, drops in quality, or a question of their
15,01     membership.  But in any event, you can see we are not as big as we used
15,01     to be... hmm.

15,01           And so ends yet another spectacular month of iCE art.
