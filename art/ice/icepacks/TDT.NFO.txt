15,01Author Notes:
15,01        Greets...  Well, they told me to write a little NFO file.  Well, I
15,01am not too happy with this demo, but then again, it was my first attempt
15,01at Mode-X so deal.  Thanks got to VLA for helpin' me with learning
15,013-D shit.  
15,01        I guess this iCE Pack definitely shows you that THG F/X has merged
15,01with iCE VGA Crew.  It went pretty smooth and was basically handled over
15,01InterNet.  The sound routines are SLOW as piss, so forgive me.  I didn't
15,01have time to implement the new routines.  Oh well...


15,01General Bullshit Greets go to:

15,01        FordPrefect      :  Stud!
15,01        Renegade BitHead :  Where's my damn Text file!??
15,01        Quick Silver     :  Err I mean Iridium?  
15,01        Syntax Error     :  Too many damn greets man...CHILL! :)
15,01        Quazar & Vapor   :  Good job on Couriering boys...

15,01Note:  Watch for my board going up soon...about a month.  Number will
15,01        follow in next demo...



15,01'Nuff Bullshit!
