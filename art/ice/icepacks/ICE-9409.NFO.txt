15,01 1.   All iCE members are required to have an account on Sanctuary(tm).
15,01      The *NEW* number is 305.pro.sanc (776.7262).  Furthermore, it will
15,01      soon become policy for the artist to maintain the responsiblity
15,01      for getting his artwork to the board if he/she wants it included
15,01      within the pack.  A shuttle menu will be added to facilitate the
15,01      artwork transfer and to reduce the cost for the artists.

15,01 2.   Special thanks go out to Soul Rebel for agonizing over the assembly
15,01      of this month's pack.  His dedication is appreciated.  Also, thanks
15,01      to Deeply Disturbed and Sexual Chocolate for their assistance.

15,01 3.   We'd like to extend our sincere apologies to both Stone the Crow
15,01      and Thor for the unfortunate exclusion of their work from last
15,01      month's pack.  However, some of the previously omitted work is 
15,01      featured in this month's pack.

15,01 4.   New to our ANSI division this month are Spirit of Illusion, Lithium,
15,01      Psyberman, Vanquish, Red Leader, and Animal.  These artists should 
15,01      prove to be an invaluable addition to the already exceptional team of 
15,01      iCE ANSI artists.  VGA-wise, please welcome Cheese Grater, ImageSex,
15,01      and Ink, who designed the interface for Epidemic.

15,01 4.5  We'd also like to make mention of the VGA's done by two of Finland's
15,01      best, Pixel and Skaven.  They really wanted to see what people thought
15,01      of their VGA work, so we'll continue to provide our friends at FC
15,01      the arena in which they can show off their talents.

15,01 5.   Our new coding coordinator, Friar, has been hard at work, and his
15,01      much anticipated PowerGrid loader, complete with Assembly source
15,01      code, is included in this month's pack.  Another completed
15,01      project is Captain Crunch's work on Corruption #4.  New coding
15,01      recruits include Nightfire and the return of Poskgubbe.

15,01 6.   On the Internet front, iCE has established a private mailing list
15,01      to facilitate communication between members.  Members who are
15,01      interested in subscribing to the mailing list may contact
15,01      egghead@cloud9.net.  A big thanks goes out to Egghead for his
15,01      hard work in maintaining the list.

15,01 7.   Thor has informed us that he will no longer be able to
15,01      participate in iCE.  He received an unexpected phone bill in
15,01      excess of $1000 dollars and has decided to sell his computer to
15,01      accommodate this debt.  We wish him luck, and hope he will be
15,01      able to rejoin us soon.

15,01 8.   iCE is losing a valuable senior staff member--one we will not
15,01      easily be able to replace.  Aphex Twin has recently left for
15,01      college, and though we are sorry to see him go, we wish him luck!
15,01      We look forward to his continued tradition of fine ansi art, and we
15,01      will hopefully be able to bring you some of his new work in the months
15,01      to come.

15,01 9.   There are a few items unable to be viewed within our MultiView
15,01      program.. those include the RIPS by MasterKen and Lord Soth, the 
15,01      PowerGrid Loader/Source by Friar Tuck, and the two .BIN files.
15,01      Also, make sure to look at the three wonderful .JPG's by ImageSex
15,01      and Mascot.
