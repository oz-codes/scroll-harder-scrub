15,01The Eleventh Hour

15,01A melancholy sky that drips with acid rain,
15,01Falling on the masses and deadening their pain,
15,01Walking like the dead with minds devoid of thought,
15,01Caring not a bit for the wars they all have fought,
15,01They work without devotion, they build without a care,
15,01They earn not a single penny, but their government is fair,
15,01Faceless propoganda fills their brainwashed minds,
15,01They never check their motives for they fear what they will find,
15,01Controlled by corporations, controlled by wealth and greed,
15,01Lacking human emotions as they get all that they need,
15,01A nation ruled through lies, a nation ruled through fear,
15,01A nation scared to fight the system for they know the end is near,
15,01The power is unchecked, corruption grows each day,
15,01No one even notices for they have nothing to say,
15,01Humanity has fallen and emotion has not survived,
15,01The corporations took control as the eleventh hour arrived.


15,01** This is just a little warning from Ronin (and a cool ad :) ), we all need
15,01to get off our asses and stop the power of the corps.
