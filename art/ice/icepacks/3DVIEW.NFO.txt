15,01Hello Dudes.

15,01This is the 3d viewer version 1.0alpha - it was completed about 12 hours 
15,01before the pack was been released, so no extensive beta testing could have 
15,01properly been completed.

15,01Briefly, the idea behind this routine is to invent a new art-form - three 
15,01dimensional art. For quite some time now, iCE has ruled ANSi and VGAs... Now 
15,01we have created our very own art form.  I hope it will be spread to other 
15,01groups, and provide our artists with another creative form of expression.

15,01This early 1.0 release of the program merely serves as a viewer for files that
15,01are created within 3-D Studio (files which are saved as *.3D files).  It only
15,01currently has support for one object, but will probably handle multiple 
15,01objects in the next release.

15,01Run it using (on the command line):

15,013DVIEW.EXE <*.3D>

15,01Keyboard controls are as follows:

15,01 * 1/2: increase or decrease the size of the object being
15,01        displayed.

15,01 * Q/W: increase or decrease the delta angle #1.        

15,01 * A/S: increase or decrease the delta angle #2.

15,01 * Z/X: increase or decrease the delta angle #3.

15,01 * T  : Reset all angles/delta angles.

15,01 * Esc: break out of this thing.

15,01The newer version (next iCEPACK...) will support light source shading and 
15,01maybe bitmapped images - but that would require heavy CPU usage - unlike this 
15,01that will run perfectly on a 286 level machine.

15,01Ford Prefect - iCE - UNT - TPC - HaSP

15,01Special thanks go to:

15,01* Spockous (or is it Calius?) - thanks for standing by for the beta testing.. 
15,01  hopefully my poly fill routines won't fuckup the sinus table next time :)

15,01* Syntax Error - thanks for pushing the deadline.. hehe. 

15,01greets go to... err, all IRC cool guys, Dark Knight, Fenris Wolf, Bandieto, 
15,01Tempus (now got my drift?), DDon.. BoniJoni, AMachine, Tarl Cabot, Zax, Zig, 
15,01Iridium, Renegade Bithead, Warchild, and I am sure I left out too many of you 
15,01pals... next time :)

15,01( Isrealian spell checking handled by Syntax Error.. :) )
