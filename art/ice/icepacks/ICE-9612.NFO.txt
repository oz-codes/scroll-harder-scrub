00,011.  Another December behind us,  as iCE looks  forward to operating  in its 7th
00,01calendar year.   But this December pack shouldn't be ignored!  It's filled with
00,01lots of eye-candy that  you're sure to eat up!  (And,  it has no cholesterol or
00,01calories, which is good news after holiday feasting and drinking!)

00,012.  Force Ten, Mass Delusion, Cold and Ugly, and BoA were out wandering the iCY
00,01wastelands (no, not Canada... necessarily!)  when they were ambushed by a small
00,01group of migratory giant earthworms!  The dynamic crew were saved when the lead
00,01earthworm bit into BoA and decided he didn't like the Black Crowes -- something
00,01about a bad omen or whatnot. :)

00,013.  We need to make a note  that the real number  for The Sanctuary(tm),  iCE's
00,01BBS headquarters, is ++1-954-791-RiCE (7423).   For those that don't know, it's
00,01operated by our very own Tempus Thales,  who points out that he, along with the
00,01board itself,  it's users,  it's community,  and practically everything else is
00,01gay. So don't be fooled by false number advertising, call the real thing today!

00,014.  Whoops!  We jumped the gun a bit in the last .NFO file about ice.org; there
00,01was a slight problem in the anonymous FTP site (ftp.ice.org) that caused one of
00,01the commands to be inoperative for a short time.   It's been remedied,  and NOW
00,01we can  say that  ice.org is  100% back  and better than before,  with some new
00,01hardware and software upgrades, as well as additional bandwidth.

00,015.  iCE once again proved that we are  the most "stellar" art conglomerate this
00,01month with the increase in strong theories  about Mars and its soil.   It would
00,01appear that scientists believe that, since the red planet was once covered with
00,01water and has a low surface temperature,  that there is iCE under the soil!  We
00,01are not surprised by this revelation, and  in fact, 9 out of 10 aliens surveyed
00,01by iCE members during their abductions said  that they prefer  the iCEPACK over
00,01the other leading brands!

00,016.  The following artists were accepted  to the group after  performing the hit
00,01song "tattva" for the group.   They are:  Amnesia in Coding,  and Blenderhed in
00,01RIP/VGA.  Acintya bheda bheda tattva! (what does it mean anyway?!)

00,017a. But, our dearly departed this month was Lord Drakul, who couldn't deal with
00,01the bright reflection off the iCE and headed for Twilight.

00,017b. Going inactive this month is Kyp, the newcomer from last month.  He's going
00,01to spend some time  concentrating on honing his VGA skills,  and won't be doing
00,01much ANSI these days.  We hope to see him around soon!

00,018.  We'd like to take the opportunity to wish our fans and followers and casual
00,01viewers a happy hannukah/merry christmas/happy yule!  We hope that your holiday
00,01was as fulfilling as can be.

00,019.  The year's over!  Happy new year to everyone from all of us at iCE! 1997!!!

00,0110. Once again, high quality output from everyone, even though everyone was
00,01quite scattered during the holidays/finals/break.  Congratulations on a job
00,01well done.  Bring on 1997...
