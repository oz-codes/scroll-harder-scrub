15,011.  We welcome several new members this month:

15,01    The big news this month is that Bladerunner, formerly of ACiD Productions,
15,01    has become a member of iCE.  He is best known for his animations which
15,01    deal with perspective, and his incredible artist talent.  The majority of
15,01    his ansi's are entirely his own art.

15,01    With him as always is Garth, hehe..j/k.. Eerie Smith, a devoted courier,
15,01    and sysop of Korova Milkbar - The South 3o5 iCE Distribution Site.

15,01    Spectral Illusion, formerly of ACiD Productions, and one-time member of iCE
15,01    during the TNO era, has re-joined iCE recently.  Welcome back man, QS can't
15,01    wait to talk to you again.
15,01   --
15,01    Ultra Vires (Vy-rez), a fellow human, became a member of iCE during the
15,01    course of this month.  His claim to fame could be: The shortest iCE Trial
15,01    stint ever.  His first iCE Trial ansi (Here in the iCEPACK) earned him the
15,01    status of a full member.  Nice to have you aboard!
15,01   --
15,01    In the coding/programming area, we welcome Draeden into iCE this month.
15,01    A coder who's knowlege and skills in the area's of vector, bitmapping, and
15,01    texture mapping earn him a place as one of the top coders at iCE.  Soon,
15,01    our artists/coders will be able to give Europe a run for it's money!
15,01   --
15,01    Last, but certainly not least, a belated welcome in to the newest Senior
15,01    Staff member, Metal Head.  He should've been introduced last month, but
15,01    umm...uhh..I was struck by alien rays and got sporatic amnesia! Yes.
15,01    The former president of a group which merged with MiRAGE, left to restart
15,01    another group of his own, many of you know it as Legacy.  After running the
15,01    very successful group alongside Black Ire for a short time, he left on good
15,01    terms to help iCE fill the void left by Lord Mischief.  LM's modem expired,
15,01    some time ago, but we expect he'll be back sometime in the near future.

15,012.  Infinite Darkness, the iCE Southern Headquarters is back up, and CCi is
15,01    running at 3/4 steam!  Grin... just need that Western Hub!

15,01    Korova Milkbar, iCE Distribution Site, is back up and now with 5oo megs!

15,01    Sanctuary(tm) exists!  (ok, ok..cheap plug..grin)

15,01    Exodus, is a new Distribution Site located in Luxemborg, Europe.

15,013.  We've stopped starting the iCE Amiga thing, due to lack of interest.

15,014.  Less artists have been spotted ripping Slum's font, but it's still alive,
15,01    there are several variations on the theme in this month's pack.

15,015.  The artwork in this month's iCEPACK has collectively reached a new high,
15,01    congrat's guys, let's keep it like this!

15,016.  It's recently come to our attention here that the artists at ACiD, unlike
15,01    the artists at iCE, are into "Quality not Quantity".  We've talked to many
15,01    of the guys about this, and from all of us to Tank of ACiD Productions,
15,01    we'd just like to say:  It's news to us!

15,018.  A new standard has been adopted for naming the iCEPACK's.  Because the old
15,01    method would cause ridiculous confusion if it was continued, we're naming
15,01    it like so:  ICE-193.ZIP
15,01                 ^^^ ~^^
15,01                  |  | +---- The year.
15,01                  |  +------ The number of the month.
15,01                  +--------- Represents what the artists of iCE have produced,
15,01                             and what the group as a whole has officially
15,01                             released that month.

15,019.  By request of Shihear Kallizad, and the fact that it seems to be a good
15,01    idea..grin, we'd like to dedicate February 1993 as the "iCE- Taking care
15,01    of it's Own" month.   What on earth does that mean?  Basically, we'd like
15,01    to achieve our goal of AT LEAST ONE AD FOR EVERY iCE AFILLIATED BOARD.
15,01    It's going to be up to the artists in the group to make this happen because
15,01    the staff isn't going to be able to coordinate it.  If you've got a couple
15,01    pictures, or ideas that aren't for a board yet, find an iCE Site, Member
15,01    board, or HQ and do it for that board.  Remember, it's up to you, the
15,01    artists, to make this work.
