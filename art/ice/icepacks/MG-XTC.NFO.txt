15,01Ok, here is the first of the damned Animated ads I'm in the middle of doing.
15,01Look for the next one, an Atomic Dustbin sprite animation, as soon as I can code

15,01the bastard...

15,01Yea, a FLI, cheesy? Tough, I sat around for a month trying to code it this way
15,01and that, in ASM and Pascal, and everytime I come up with problems of it
15,01skipping certain parts...so I did it in a FLI in an hour and got it out. Maybe
15,01when I can learn to code decently I can actually do it that way, but until then,

15,01live with it! :)

15,01On a good note, I can code sprite animations, and am done with one right
15,01now....but am having conflicts in memory when I try to do it along with sound
15,01and an intro ad...as soon as I figure out how to fix this (or get pissed and do
15,01it another way, heh) you'll see it.

15,01In the meantime, have fun and be sure to call XTC!
