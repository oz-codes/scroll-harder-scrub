15,01 
15,01                               Meae Deliciae

15,01 Between the mountains and the sky
15,01 there's room for just two,
15,01 you and I.
15,01 Between the heavens and the sea
15,01 there's room for just two
15,01 you and me.

15,01 But as two souls wind there way
15,01 among the gentle glades and parched fields
15,01 they find no bliss but that existing
15,01 to the gentle pressure of a contemplative hand.
15,01 As the forest closes its great arms about us
15,01 and draws us into its primitive earthiness
15,01 the light dims but the forest is not still
15,01 life moves beneath our very footfalls.
15,01 But at last the green boughs part,
15,01 we're overtaken by the love
15,01 the love and amazement of two young children
15,01 born pure and in awe into a world
15,01 and as we turn our gaze skyward,
15,01 we notice the same flash in eachother's eye
15,01 and laugh the hearty laugh of souls true to oneself.
15,01 If it should be that the oceans swell 
15,01 and wash the sickness from man's mind
15,01 he would find nothing more true 
15,01 than his own heart and that of his sister
15,01 his companion, his one true love.
