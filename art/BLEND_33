15,01                        Math Final
15,01 
15,01     The setting is Ohio State University about six or seven years ago 
15,01in a huge lecture hall (approximately 1000 students) for a Calculus 
15,01final.  Apparently this particular calculus teacher wasn't very well liked.
15,01He was one of those guys who would stand at the front of the class and yell
15,01out how much time was remaining before the end of a test, a real charmer.
15,01Since he was so busy galavanting around the room making sure that nobody
15,01cheated and that everyone was aware of how much time they had left before
15,01their failure on the test was complete, he had the students stack the
15,01completed tests on the huge podium at the front of the room.  This made for
15,01quite a mess, remember there were 1000 students in the class.  Anyway,
15,01during this particular final, one guy entered the test 
15,01needing a descent grade to pass the class.  His only problem with 
15,01Calculus was that he did poorly when rushed, and this ass standing in
15,01the front of the room barking out how much time was left before the tests
15,01had to be handed in didn't help him at all.  He figured he wanted to assure 
15,01himself of a good grade, so he hardly flinched when the professor said 
15,01"pencils down and submit your scantron sheets and work to piles at the 
15,01front of the room".  Five minutes turned into ten, ten into twenty, twenty 
15,01into fourty...almost an hour after the test was "officially over", our friend
15,01finally put down his pencil, gathered up his work, and headed to the 
15,01front of the hall to submit his final.  The whole time, the professor
15,01sat at the front of the room, strangely waiting for the student to complete 
15,01his exam.


15,01     "What do you think you're doing?" the professor asked as the 
15,01student stood in front of him about to put down his exam on one
15,01of the neatly stacked piles of exams (the professor had plenty of 
15,01time to stack the mountain of papers while he waited)  It was 
15,01clear that the professor had waited only to give the student a
15,01hard time.

15,01     "Turning in my exam," retorted the student confidently.

15,01     "I'm afraid I have some bad news for you," the profesor gloated, 
15,01"Your exam is an hour late.  You've FAILED it and, consequently, 
15,01I'll see you next term when you repeat my course."

15,01     The student smiled slyly and asked the professor "Do you know who 
15,01I am?"

15,01     "What?" replied the professor grufly, annoyed that the student 
15,01showed no sign of emotion.

15,01     The student rephrased the question mockingly, "Do you know what my 
15,01name is?"

15,01     "NO", snarled the professor.

15,01     The student looked the professor dead in the eyes and said 
15,01slowly, "I didn't think so", as he lifted up one of the stacks 
15,01half way, shoved his test neatly into the center of the stack,
15,01let the stack fall burying his test in the middle, turned around,
15,01and walked casually out of the huge lecture hall.
