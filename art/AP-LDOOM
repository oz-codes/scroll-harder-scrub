10,01  11Slip into your borrowed skin,
11,01  flash a cold and wicked grin.
11,01  Dance with those you called your friends
11,01  and to your anger must append
11,01  those countless nights you spent alone
11,01  upon your bone and ivory throne.
11,01  Weeping at your hands stained red
11,01  with waters of the newly dead.
11,01  You scream into the lonely night,
11,01  rage a cloud a'front your sight
11,01  and to a spectral choir sing
11,01  a hymn of love and diamond rings.

15,01       10"11Atop a hilltop cold and wet,
15,01        11whereupon at first we met,
15,01        11pressed against the chalky black10,
15,01        11moonlight streaming down our backs,
15,01        11exchanging vows of love and faith
15,01        11darkness fleeing like a wraith.
15,01        11And when at last the sun had found
15,01        11it's tendril's 'round that earthen mound,
15,01        11Our fate was sealed forever more
15,01        11with that sunlight peppered ore.10"

10,01  11The night absorbs with eager ear
11,01  as it's children scream in fear.
11,01  For everytime they hear your tale
11,01  Faces twist and drain to pale.
11,01  Even though they know the end10,
10,01  11Eyes still water.  Hearts still rend.
11,01  With a reverence shown to none
11,01  they bow beneath their anti-sun
11,01  and erect against the midnight wall
11,01  listen to your tortured fall.

15,01       10"11On the day the sky spit fire
15,01        11calling sea and mountain liar,
15,01        11raping earth with rabid tongues
15,01        11of lightning from those tired lungs
15,01        11of heaven with its awful might
15,01        11refusing now to stand and fight.

15,01        11With a blow that smote all kin
15,01        11ripping through the ancient skin
15,01        11a shadow from the Ether came
15,01        11to that planet often famed
15,01        11and from the earths dark bosom rent,
15,01        11that child of the darkness sent
15,01        11with murder on its fetid breath
15,01        11a snapshot of our coming death.

15,01        11A pawn of wicked games to play,
15,01        11a character, which to god's dismay
15,01        11has found a niche upon this Earth
15,01        11to witness now my own rebirth,
15,01        11as ring upon my finger set
15,01        11with pain and salty sorrow wet
15,01        11reminds me of his loving face
15,01        11which once was here upon this place.10"

10,01   11Now you sit on iron spires
11,01   mourning in your hall of liars.
11,01   Shells of those you used to love
11,01   swinging gently from above.
11,01   like scattered thoughts upon the sand
11,01   bodies litter broken land.
11,01   Leaving you in isolation
11,01   gazing at the devastation.
