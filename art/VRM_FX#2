15,01i understand you, vermin, and i agree with you, i don't want a war at all.
15,01i just wanted to know if you was trying to get me out of the scene and 
15,01making a war (if i ever could have defended myself). Soo, is this (boring)
15,01case out of the entire world? (so you know it, i didn't want any excuses
15,01from you, if you think soo!)
