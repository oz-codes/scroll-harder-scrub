15,01in this mornings stillness
15,01i felt you beside me
15,01Although I haven't seen you in years
15,01when I woke up
15,01I was sure you were beside me
15,01and everything was back the way it was
15,01When i danced around you playing cowboys and indians
15,01all you did was stand and stare
15,01it made the clumsy moment so much more true
15,01Nobel just by your native nature
15,01when we danced in the rain
15,01I loved you more than
15,01anything
15,01 and were you not my misplaced
15,01sister
15,01I would marry you
15,01and we could grow old
15,01 For what seemed like years
15,01and was only half of one
15,01we lived together
15,01and we played
15,01we fought
15,01destroyed each other
15,01again and again
15,01years later
15,01my first bare moments with a woman
15,01when we are alone with another
15,01why am I nervous
15,01sleep to hide
15,01I decorate my memories of you
15,01when searching them I look for the hidden places inside
15,01Even I love, as i cut you
15,01try and hide
15,01away from the battles and lies
15,01we are building our own world
15,01within her beat a heart, to welcome flooding darkness in
15,01which to brew special magic
15,01when I first returned
15,01to this New lost city
15,01at night i would put on black
15,01and go down looking for the peaceful village
15,01after that summer with her
15,01How was I to know the lure of man or woman
15,01I was seated in a small cafe
15,01he aproached me with a delightful
15,01swagger in his walk
15,01he told me, i had ancient eyes
15,01like leaves beaten and torn
15,01capturing souls of lost women
15,01he took me home to his apartment
15,01It was
15,01one large room
15,01a ceiling so high
15,01you knew you would never really
15,01understand what it looked like
15,01I remeber his golden tanned skin
15,01as he took off his shirt,
15,01and mine
15,01the exitement of tattoos
15,01and the exquisite smell of
15,01sandalwood and patchouli oils
15,01his apartment was filled with odd objects
15,01and pictures of angels
15,01he had a large futon bed
15,01it must have been seven feet long
15,01and as many wide
15,01it was one of those slow soft beds you spend years of your life in
15,01he lighted incense
15,01and candles
15,01and dreams came alive
15,01he dimmed the lghts and brewed some tea
15,01he said, in almost a stuttering whisper
15,01tonight we dance, and sleep with the angels
15,01slowly some music began to come out of the background
15,01it was vaguely baroque, women lost in love were singing
15,01there songs for the men at sea
15,01there were whales and peacocks crying
15,01in the dark
15,01I remeber how he looked at me in
15,01that room of mists and fogs and dancing lights
