15,01...Blurred Vision..



15,01Sorrow floods above your foolish soul,
15,01Seems that your dreams have lost control.

15,01Can't find a way out, Can't backtrack the way in,
15,01Indeed, there seems no place to begin.

15,01Searching the walls of the soul around you,
15,01All you see are the chains that have bound you.

15,01Only one other thing meets your eyes as you seek,
15,01A bottle that's labeled "Keep out of reach!"

15,01Not knowing any other way to deny the truth,
15,01You unscrew the cap and reflect back on youth.

15,01All your life passes by, from birth to the present,
15,01Endless parade of actions you'd like to repent.

15,01Now all seems hopeless, just a drop in the jar,
15,01Nothing seems to matter much anymore.

15,01Raise the jar to your lips, stare in sorrow,
15,01Choice to drink, knowing there will be no tomorrow.

15,01It is then that you make your final decision
15,01And everything fades behind blurred vision.
