15,01  On the first day, there was darkness.

15,01Out of the darkness there came the one.

15,01And there was just this one. Neither a he nor a she, nor an it. Neither a
15,01being, nor an unbeing.

15,01And then in the way of things, the one split. And from the one came the
15,01triad.

15,01The being, the unbeing and the controller. The yin, the yang and the
15,01barrier. The weaver, the wyld and the wyrm.

15,01For the weaver was being. It was the bounds that makes matter. It was the
15,01Is.

15,01The wyld was chaos. The opposite of matter, not just vacuum, bbbut true
15,01nothingness. It was the Not.

15,01And the wyrm was the controller. It was the barrier between being and
15,01chaos. It was the scales on which Is and Not are weighed.

15,01The weaver wove. It formed matter and being where there was nothingness. It 
15,01made the the solids that we all are, and yet are not.
15,01The wyld distorted. It was the life giver. It took the static creations of
15,01the weaver and gave them change. It was the force behind all interaction.
15,01The wyld took the static creations that were our bodies, and gave them
15,01life.
15,01Onwards and onwards the struggle went. The weaver created static beauty.
15,01The wyld possessed it. Animals had thought, plants transformed, lava
15,01flowed.

15,01This is creation. These were and are the acts that gave the world life, and
15,01give it stillstill. The weaver is eternal, as is the wyld and the wyrm. The
15,01weaver and wyld struggling, the wyrm ever balancing and maintaining.

15,01All the world are their creatures. All mankind is formed of the classic
15,01states. The Is, the Not and the Balance of the two.

15,01The flesh of man is the weaver. The motion and thought of man are the wyld.
15,01The death of man is end of flesh and motion. The death of man is the
15,01Balance.

15,01And so understand what you are and are not. You are the consumation of the
15,01battle and the balance. You are the combination of the triad. You are the
15,01ultimate Balance of the Being and Chaos. Understand the true pointlessness
15,01of your being, the pointlessness that is your point of being. Attain the
15,01Balance that you represent, and learn the only fulfilment that is true.

15,01OK, so its a little morbid in its way. Its also elevating in a similar way }8-)
15,01I'm not saying that this is what life is, but its certainly one viewpoint...
15,01I'll leave whether its mine out for now...                  @   14,15@15,01+  @+   f  x"vS
