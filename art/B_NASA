15,01Place: Moon.

15,01        Well here I am.  Sitting in the middle of my dusty old crater,
15,01running out of oxygen.  Damn it, I hate NASA!
15,01  "Come to the Moon! New Places! New Faces! A world of opportunity awaits!"
15,01What a load of hogwash.  Well the Earth is starting to set.  The sun is
15,01coming round.  Man, is it bright!  (oxygen 78%)  Well I might as well 
15,01take advantage of the near zero gravity, I have always wanted to jump
15,01up and down like an idiot.  (oxygen 52%)  Well, one thing for sure, it's a
15,01beautiful place, the moon.  Dark and silent, tranquil.  No one to tell you
15,01what to do or where to go.  No deadlines...  (oxygen 48%)  The craters are
15,01wonderful.  Wide and smooth.  Untouched.  Oceans of ancient dust.  And the
15,01mountains, the mountains!  Higher then any on the Earth.  (oxygen 44%)  
15,01So high they touch the stars.  The view is spectacular.  You can see the 
15,01whole Earth.  A blue disk of life, in the black pool of nothing.  Water.
15,01Trees.  None of that here though.  At least there is nothing for the
15,01enviromentalists to bitch about.  (oxygen 21%)  I visited the Dark Side
15,01yesterday.  It was wonderful.  So many stars.  So many lives.  There is only
15,01one thing that I don't like about the moon.  And that is...  (oxygen 0%)
