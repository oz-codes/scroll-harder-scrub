The one wherein I discuss "moralism"
Ok, I know what you're all expecting, me writing another scathing critique of 888chan, r3x, and chanology in general. I must admit that for a long time I was against this, the /i/ I was used to didn't involve doing anything IRL (the closest thing might have been a phone call,) and the fact that the actions of some /i/nsurgents may have been motivated by their morals and or religious beliefs disgusted me.
 
I guess I was just afraid of the lulz. Right now I'm looking over 888chan's /i/, and I see quite a few raids that I might have called "moralfaggy" a while ago. Some of them are actually pretty lulzy. Even my retarded feud with r3x over him trying to "steal" the wiki. He was right, I was being a control freak and a tripfaggot and I tried to keep all of the "e-glory" to myself.
 
I hope that r3x will consider joining forces with partyvan.info in the future so we can build a better /i/ together.
