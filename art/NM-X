15,01         "Can I by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a
15,01          loftier tower which may be a fortress to me all my days?"
15,01         For what men say is that, if I am really just and am not also
15,01         thought just, profit there is none, but the pain and loss on
15,01         the other hand are unmistakeable.  But if, though unjust, I
15,01         acquire the reputation of justice, a heavenly life is promised
15,01         to me.  Since then, as philosophers prove, appearance tyrannizes
15,01         over truth and is lord of happiness, to appearance I
15,01         must devote myself.  I will describe around me a picture and
15,01         shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my
15,01         house;  behind I will trail the subtle and craft fox, as
15,01         Archilochus, greatest of sages, recommends.  But I hear some
15,01         one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often
15,01         difficult; to which I answer, "Nothing great is easy."
