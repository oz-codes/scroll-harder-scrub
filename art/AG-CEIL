15,01blank stares at the ceiling, or attempts at drawing down the wonky star I saw 
15,01above a lake this evening. this ushers in the cloaked figure of Superfluity: I
15,01have an obsession with our (whatever exists) uselessness. Consequence is a lie
15,01to keep us alive for "a good number" of years. But i found ecstasy in it all, 
15,01a moment with two of my favourite artists: kate and leonard. This time the 
15,01beauty was in leonard's singing against his own demise, or Love's demise, 
15,01everything's demise, and relishing in it (" lost...like star's against the 
15,01sun")...And Kate (Bush) was just there, or I was in her (legs and all) with my
15,01father's blue/yellow shoe string, swaying with Leonard's band. So I too, 
15,01though not as well, fizzled: hear my brief fizzle, world:

15,01  the key to happiness
15,01  a saxophone shape
15,01  blows air, beautiful air
15,01  soon enough
15,01  the dark.
