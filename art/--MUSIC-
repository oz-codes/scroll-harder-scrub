15,01A patrol car has been following this vehicle for about 30 minutes now, when
15,01they finally decide to pull it over.  The officer steps out and walks up to
15,01the driver's window.

15,01"Good afternoon sir"

15,01"Good afternoon, any problems ?"

15,01"No sir.  My partner and I have been following and observing you for
15,01a half an hour now.  We ascertained that you have not committed one single
15,01traffic violation, you have not gone over the speed limit by even 1 mph,
15,01you were courteous towards the fellow drivers on the road. Therefore, as a
15,01part of our new "solid driving awareness program" I would like to present
15,01you with this check for $30,000.00."

15,01The driver lets out a big sigh of relief:

15,01"Oh good !  Now I can finally pay to get my driver's license. (Ooops!)"

15,01Awkward silence, then the wife sitting in the passenger seat goes:

15,01"Don't listen to him, officer, he always talks nonsense when he has
15,01been drinking."

15,01Grandma who's a little hard of hearing adds from the backseat:

15,01"Aye aye aye, didn't I tell you not to go in a stolen car ? "

15,01At this time the trunk pops open and a head peeks out:

15,01"Are we over the border yet ?"
