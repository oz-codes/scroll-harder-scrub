00,01- trully, i think some ppl doesn't know what they are saying..15 00i think,
00,01  sargon, u were just frustrated that we split up serial and aphro, and
00,01  u felt like bitching at us.. u know u like the aphro boys!

15,01<ca1n> mjay: aphro was lame
00,01- oh well, join the club.. sargon's club.. the one where noone knows what
00,01  they are talking about or what they are saying.

15,01<blk_jack> too much oldskool

15,01i only put a few of what i've got.
15,01overall ppl thought the pack was ok.  alot thought it really rocked, some
15,01others said it simply sucked. but i think most of 'em didn't judge it on
15,01what they've seen in it, but for a lot of other personal reasons.
