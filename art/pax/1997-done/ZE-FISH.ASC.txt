15,01  yes, it's a smoking fish. i know that. you know that. my 14dog15 knows that. but
15,01  i just sat down and started drawing, and this is what came out... who knew ?
15,01  anyways, this probably would have made more sense on 14piranha15 or 14skullfish15 or
15,01  something, but i was supposed to do a trade with 14brain eater15 from 14acid15,  and
15,01  this is the best pic i've done in a while, so here it is. i kinda like it,so
15,01  live with it.
