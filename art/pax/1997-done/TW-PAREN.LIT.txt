15,01Parents
15,01By The Warden [FLiP]

15,01They give us
15,01Love, Care, Attention, Guidance, Shelter
15,01But as teenagers there is many times
15,01When our parents become annoying to us
15,01No matter what they do or say
15,01Most of the time we go against what they wish
15,01Teenage hood is a time of rebellion and confusion
15,01A time in which some of us must learn on our own

15,01We all love our parents
15,01And wish to please them
15,01But there becomes a time
15,01When we must make our own decisions
15,01There is nothing our parents can do or say
15,01To stop us from doing wrong
15,01Or making bad decisions

15,01This is a difficult time
15,01For parents to handle
15,01All we ask from our parents
15,01Is there love and support

15,01  I would like to dedicated this poem to all the loving parents around
15,01  the globe. Don't abandon your children! Remember parents we love you!
