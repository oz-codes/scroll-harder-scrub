15,01         there comes a time in every man's life
15,01         when he needs to stand up and be counted.
15,01         now is my time.
15,01         i will be heard.

15,01         crisis of all types have come my way
15,01         i have faced them all
15,01         with queit resistance
15,01         with gradual acquiescence
15,01         but no longer.

15,01         i'm tired of being the understanding one
15,01         solid.
15,01         stable.
15,01         reliable.
15,01         a shoulder to cry on.
15,01         an ear to bend.
15,01         a bank for the poor.
15,01         i'm sick of it.

15,01         it's time for me to step back.
15,01         to see what's important to me.
15,01         to tell the rest to kiss my ass.
15,01         it's time to put me first.

15,01         no pressure to perform.
15,01         no need to exceed the rest.
15,01         no reason not to be ecstatically happy.
15,01         and yet i'm not.
15,01         i don't know how to say just how wrong that is.

15,01         so it's time for me to look out for #1.
15,01         no longer having to do something because THEY want me to.
15,01         i control my own life
15,01         and quite honestly...
15,01         ...i deserve so much more.
