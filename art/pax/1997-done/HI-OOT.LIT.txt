15,01And once again I continue in a heroic effort
15,01     to live out of touch

15,01Whats that you said? I cant here you.
15,01     I'm busy with my bottle

15,01My back hurts from lifting and I cant find my parachute
15,01     Have you seen me anywhere?

15,01I'm bored of all this schooling
15,01     I cant find a teacher here

15,01I'm too full of complaints I know
15,01     I'll listen now

15,01It's time to give my energy to others
15,01     Where do I plug in around here?

15,01So once again I continue in a heroic effort
15,01     To live out of touch?

15,01     Pardon?

15,01     Who, me?

15,01     Why thank you for showing me.

15,01     It's been on my back the whole time...
