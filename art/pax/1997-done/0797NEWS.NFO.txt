00,01- Pirate --14 If your wondering "15Does the freak always talk like that?14" the answer
14,01is "15No i don't, i just felt like doing some other than normal writing up there14  
15,01in the ascii14".15 14First thing i want to point out, i DO NOT think 00o-r   14 is better
14,01than 15d3814, although if you guys give a chance and get over the fact that 15d3814 is
14,01bigger than most of the groups in NZ, then maybe we'll get to where they are at
14,01the moment. I have alot of respect going out to 15Blind Sniper14 and the crew at 15d38

14,01Just before i go...I wanna give some shoutouts, so i don't have to do it in the
14,01pack...15D3814, 15Frost14 (aka 15Quantum14), 15Plague14 (longest running NZ group), and all the
14,01other New Zealand groups out there, whether you be 15Art14/15Code14/15whatever14. 



00,01- Calvin Klein -- 14Before i go waffling on about nothing at all, just to point
14,01something out :) Pirate wrote that and did most of his ascii/ansi quite awhile
14,01ago, he's been abit out of it for awhile (but we all have)..Okay here i go :)

14,01Opium Raiders was formed about 1-2 months ago, it's a merger of 2 groups.
14,01Timewalk (Leading at the time was Satan)
14,01Frost (Leading at the time was Enzyme)
14,01Now the two groups have come together under one banner of Opium Raiders. Hurray!
14,01Plus i'm leading at the moment, although i don't have that much time anymore.

14,01Anyway, i'm way too tired to talk about anything.. If you have any questions 
14,01that don't get answered in this pack, then ring one of the HQ boards and get a
14,01message to me or a senior member :) Also, anyone out there who is interested in
14,01joining us, theres an Opium Raider app-gen (so like go use it or something ?
14,01Last thing, Filter made us a ans/asc viewer, in time it's gonna get modified so
14,01it can view gif/jpg and anything else, maybe even play music? so yeah.. i hope
14,01your fecking using that to view this?!?! Well yeah bye.. 


00,01- Calvin Klein -- 14It's me again :) Just a little update from the members, Xide
14,01has recently thought of something called A^C, which is basically 1 big colly all
14,01merged and combined together. Filter has taken over most of the work of Satan,
14,01because Satan is working on something special for us at the moment. We're still
14,01and always looking for more members or anyone that can help us out. We also have
14,01out own viewer and an app-gen if anyone wants to join, you can upload that to
14,01any Distro board we have. And thats about it, i'm gonna go put the pack together
14,01now.
