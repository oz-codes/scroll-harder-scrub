15,01    A Parallax View
15,01    --------------- 
15,01    In brightest day.
15,01    In darkest night.
15,01    Or so he thought.

15,01    An imposter of a great hero cost him everything.
15,01    A city destroyed.
15,01    A life in ruins.
15,01    Seven million cry from beyond the grave.

15,01    Vengence,
15,01    and the power to restore the right.
15,01    His mentors,
15,01    his Guardians,
15,01    turned their backs in his hour of need.
15,01    And so the end began.

15,01    Enemies and allies stood in his way.
15,01    They failed.
15,01    And so he created paradise
15,01    just to realize it was a lie.
15,01    The death and destruction could never be repaired
15,01    without undoing the world.
15,01    Even with unlimited power, that would be wrong.
15,01    After all, he is a hero.

15,01    He tracked the murderer to the ends of the universe.
15,01    Cornered him between this universe and the great beyond.
15,01    The gates of our hero's soul opened.
15,01    Seven million drank of sweet revenge.
15,01    It was over, but much was still undone.

15,01    The world needed his aid.
15,01    He knew that it could be his end,
15,01    but still he helped.
15,01    For he is a hero,
15,01    even if his allies thought otherwise.

15,01    His was the power of the gods.
15,01    Power to save the world
15,01    or to change it in his own image.
15,01    The past,
15,01    the future
15,01    depended on his single act.
15,01    In his salvation came his sacrifice.
15,01    And so he passed.
15,01    Or did he?

15,01    Beware his Power....
15,01    Green Lantern's light.
