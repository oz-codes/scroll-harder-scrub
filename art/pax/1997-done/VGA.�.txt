15,01Star Trek with Dilbert Management
15,01 ---------------------------------

15,01Saint Diana of Wales offers this vision of what the 24th century would be
15,01like under today's management techniques.

15,01  After the crew is told they are now Empowered, Dr. Crusher begins
15,01doing medical experiments on unsuspecting enlisted personnel while Worf
15,01slaughters everyone he considers "weak".

15,01 Data fails an ISO9000 audit because the construction of his positronic
15,01brain isn't properly documented. He curses Dr. Suhn's record keeping as
15,01he's stripped for parts.

15,01 All members of the ship's maintenance crew are required to be involved
15,01in Quality Circles. The loss of productive work time causes them to cut
15,01back on scheduled repairs, resulting in a warp core breach that kills
15,01everyone.

15,01 Commander Riker is fired after a round of "right sizing". Star Fleet
15,01decided that it didn't really need someone to seduce alien females and
15,01smirk a lot.

15,01 As part of the new Dignity Enhancement program, Piccard is forced to
15,01allow Troi to wear uniforms that cover her breasts.

15,01 Star Fleet decides to adopt the Borg "Team Building" methods and
15,01requires all newborn babies to be implanted with computer interface
15,01devices. As a bonus this cuts down on carpal tunnel disability claims.

15,01 The Enterprise finds that it can no longer communicate with Star Fleet
15,01Command because they're still running an old version of Windows and can't
15,01get budget approval for the upgrade.

15,01 As part of a cycle time reduction plan, the crew is ordered to cut the
15,01time necessary to encounter and escape from new life forms from once a
15,01week to 5 days a week. A re-use program is introduced under the nickname
15,01RERUNS (Reap Earnings and Royalties Using No-longer-produced Shows).

15,01 Piccard is ordered to go to diversity sensitivity training after system
15,01logs indicate that he has repeatedly disparaged the Ferengis, the Q and
15,01the Romulans.

15,01 A ship-wide reorganization results in Worf becoming the ship's
15,01counsellor, Dr. Crusher taking over the engine room, Deanna managing
15,01weapons, Data running sick bay and Geordi at the helm. They were
15,01conquered by a Klingon freighter 15 minutes later.

15,01 The crew mutinies when they are given their annual performance reviews
15,01and find that, despite saving the universe numerous times, they're still
15,01only getting 3% raises.
