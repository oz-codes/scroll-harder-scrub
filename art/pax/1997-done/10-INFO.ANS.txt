15,01I'm tOrgo, and this isnt your normal infofile, bitch.


15,01             00MY NAME IS TORGO, AND I AM ABUSED BY THE REST OF ECL

15,01it's true.  i am made fun of, no matter what happens.  here are a few
15,01examples.

14,01One day, we were at toys r us. I put on a baseball helmet, and then i guess 
14,01red circle thought it would be a leet idea to hit me in the head.  soon, the 
14,01rest of the people caught on, and soon i was on the hard, tile floor with 
14,01massive brian damage.

14,01We were at a gas station, and magnatop made me get gas for him while he went
14,01in and bought food and porn.  I  tried to be NICE and i washed his windsheild
14,01but then he came out and tried to run me over.

14,01one day, rai put me in the corner of his room and repeatedly hit me with his 
14,01door.  

14,01lago stole $5. 


15,01there is the evidence.  judge for yourself. =)
14,01(btw, lago eventually did give me back $5, in bits and 
14,01peices. =)


15,01in 00group news15, 00steve martin15 was going to join eclipse, but then he realized
15,01that all we are are a bunch of losers that sit and draw so that other people
15,01that sit and draw can look at it and go 'that sucks' so then he didnt.

15,01in 00member news15, we gained 00toons xillion15.  he's leet, and he gave us 00jUAREZ
15,01we also gained 00haji15, a leet ascii guy.  we have two ascii people, and thats 
15,01going to be all so dont apply because the positions have been filled.
15,01we could use someone in accounting, though, so if you are a 00public15 
00,01certified15 00accountant,15 you may apply.

00,01Also note:15 Eclipse adopted several new policies this past few weeks, but we
15,01canned most of them at the last moment because noone in eclipse lives in 
15,01califorina, so we would have to 00fly there instead,15 and that costs money, unless
15,01you haxor the airline, which was only accomplished once by CyBeRpHaNtOm.


15,01Also also note: In order to be accepted into our elite ring of juarez traders,
15,01you must have artwork that REALLY blows us away.  In all reality, though
15,01a image straight from doom2 and converted with gif2ans works for me, but not 
15,01for the other guys, i guess.

15,01Also Also Also note: we are 31337, and donut forget that.


15,01Also Also Also Also note: this is the shortest infofile ever in ecl history.
15,01that's really just a guess, but i'm too damn lazy to actually look at others
15,01so bite me.
