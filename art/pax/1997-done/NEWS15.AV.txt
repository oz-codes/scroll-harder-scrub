15,01   04|15    You've gotta wonder, how do you approach writing a news file for a group
15,01   04|15    that has been on a 00SIESTA15 for 4 months, well, I still haven't found that
15,01   04|15    out yet, but apart from adding little plugs for my bbs and articulating
15,01   04|15    bigger words than I'm capable of comprehending, I think some people may
15,01   04|15    actually read beyond the full stop here. <-- that one. So what's
15,01   04|15    happened to AV? I'll tell you what, a lack of communication, that's all
15,01   04|15    there is to it. The majority of our members have done work but they just
15,01   04|15    don't know what they are to do with it. Well, that's not completely true
15,01   04|15    and I don't want to bag any high ranking AV members more than I should
15,01   04|15    have to, but they're to blame, the senior staff of AV have just vanished
15,01   04|15    with a poof. So what happens? nothing, people think that AV is dead,
15,01   04|15    they think the AV seniors have done a runner and they think they're off
15,01   04|15    the hook and don't have to draw anymore! well it's too bad! we're back
15,01   04|15    even if with not as much strength I think we can pull it off and snag a
15,01   04|15    couple of new members. But we need help. So if you're interested, so are
15,01   04|15    we. Anyway in conclusion to not knowing what to write, I'd like to say
15,01   04|15    that the quality of this pack is up to a fine standard, and AV has still
15,01   04|15    got the quality, who cares about 3 disk packs, we have quality, and we
15,01   04|15    are still the oldest group in Australia alive, and we still haven't
15,01   04|15    released a nostalgic package of rehashed work, so juxtaposing AV with
15,01   04|15    other groups around the world and particularly in Australia, we are way,
15,01   04|15    way on top of things.

15,01   04|15    The following people have left AV:

15,01   04|15            Errrr... Like I said, their is such a lack of communication I
15,01   04|15            don't know who has piked.

15,01   04|15    The last person who wrote something about synthetic said, quoting:
15,01   04|15    "SiCK'95 all over again." Well, although "SiCK'95" only made it to 5
15,01   04|15    packs and was my first ever group which I joined at pack 4, I have to
15,01   04|15    say that I cannot see the relationship between it and Synthetic, I give
15,01   04|15    full praise to Synthetic for being the only group to stick to their time
15,01   04|15    table and release monthly, Synthetic is now up to 7 packs! and it is not
15,01   04|15    lacking anything that any normal group lacks.

15,01   04|15    I'd just like to comment on this groovey group who are based in Brazil,
15,01   04|15    not because they commented on Nutbutter's BBS, Refraction, but because
15,01   04|15    I like what they draw and they're pioneering digital art in their
15,01   04|15    country like DiE did to the Australian scene. By the way, refraction
15,01   04|15    occurs when one object runs into another causing it to go into a 
15,01   04|15    different angle, or in other words, light bending. I hope that answered
15,01   04|15    any questions you had. Keep up the great work Maiden.

15,01   04|15    Maybe you've got an understanding now of what I'm trying to say, if
15,01   04|15    you don't I suggest you hit yourself on the head with a mallet a couple
15,01   04|15    of times because this is in plain English and the only way people who
15,01   04|15    cannot understand will be excused is if they don't know English.
15,01   04|15    But the problem is we here in Australia are oblivious to the fact that
15,01   04|15    languages other than English do exist, we get taught French, Japanese,
15,01   04|15    Spanish and even Chinese, and after learning them for 6 years, we forget
15,01   04|15    them because everyone speaks English anyway. It's ludicrous! So if you
15,01   04|15    are looking at a bunch of gobbledgook, learn English.
