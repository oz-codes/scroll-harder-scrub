15,01     Top Ten Drug Using Cartoon Suspects
15,01     -----------------------------------
15,01 
15,0110. Gargamel
15,01Most likely on LSD.  Spends his life in pursuit of little blue guys in
15,01white outfits and mentally abusing his cat.  What does he plan to do with
15,01the blue dwarfs when he catches them anyway?
15,01 
15,019. Olive Oyl
15,01Probably Dexatrim abuse, maybe some amphetamines.  Who is that skinny? She
15,01might even be anorexic, she IS always giving her burger to her friend. One
15,01side question, what the hell are Popeye and Bluto thinking? They almost
15,01made the list for courting her.
15,01 
15,018. Snagglepuss (Is this even spelled righ
15,01t?)
15,01Can't explain it.  Maybe it's the name, or the look, but he is suspicious.
15,01 
15,017. HeMan
15,01This is an easy one.  I mean c'mon.  Roid monkey #1.  "BY THE POWER OF
15,01ANABOL!!!!!!"  Makes me want to root for Skeletor.  Alone in his castle,
15,01hitting the weights.  And on top of that he even injects the stuff in
15,01his pet tiger.  Animal Abuse.
15,01 
15,016. & 5.  Yogi and Boo Boo
15,01We all know what is really in those picnic baskets.  They go back to the
15,01cave and trip.
15,01 
15,014.  Droopy
15,01The number one downer abuser in toon land.  Can't someone slip him an
15,01upper every year or two?  The only time I ever saw him happy is when he
15,01sees the picture of the babe.
15,01 
15,013.  Dopey Dwarf
15,01He openly admits it.  The other dwarfs deny involvement but they are
15,01under investigation.  Allegations that Doc is writing some extra scripts
15,01for Sneezy and all the guys are partaking are afloat.
15,01 
15,012.  Daffy Duck
15,01If he isn't using crack, Merion Barry is 
15,01clean.  He is so wired he bounces
15,01around on his head without pain.  Blows his beak off all the time.  Some
15,01symptoms might be from "daffiness" but Haladol wouldn't work for him.
15,01Might for his buddy with Tourettes, Porky though.
15,01 
15,011.  Shaggy
15,01By far the #1 suspect.  His clothes, his hair, his bad goatee, the boy
15,01converses with dogs.  But all of this is nothing until you go to the
15,01Munchie Factor.  Anybody who averages 9.3 dog treats consumed per episode
15,01does pot.  Scooby is guilty by association.
15,01 
15,01And Look at the way him and his friends painted that van!
