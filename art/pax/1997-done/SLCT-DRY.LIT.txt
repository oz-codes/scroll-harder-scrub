15,01There are mysterious stains on the clothing.
15,01That's why it's here at the dry cleaner's.
15,01I hate working at the dry cleaner's.  The smell of the chemicals makes me
15,01want to gag.
15,01Fortunately I can lean out of the drive-in window from time to time to sneak 
15,01side gasps of pristine breath.
15,01Damned punks who paint their hip-hop graffiti in there are a nuisance, 
15,01though, always covering my face with their hankerchiefs.
15,01That does help considerably, however, when I try to rob the convenience 
15,01store at the end of the block.
15,01The novelty of pointing the finger in my pocket at the cashier is wearing off.
15,01That's why tI switched to pointing cucumbers at them.
15,01This too, however, soon became mundane after 6 times or so.
15,01The last time, I was determined to do something different.  When I came in 
15,01to stick up the teller, my fly was down.
15,01She looked startled, inable to utter her typical dismissal asking what was 
15,01in my pocket and if I was happy to see her.
