15,01There was a decision completely mine

15,01I cast my dreams aside
15,01As illusions fly past my eyes
15,01And dance on my bloodridden soul
15,01Marred by the pacts I betrayed
15,01And the people I've destroyed

15,01Guess I'll sit around and pine
15,01For a future which once was mine
15,01For a past now flushed away
15,01Like a well loved pet down the drain
15,01Swirling away til none remained       

15,01It hurts deep down to see one wither
15,01To lose all dignity and worth
15,01Knowing inside that they were wrong
15,01That person is in the mirror each day
15,01Pain emerging in the worst way
15,01Wracking your heart, body, and soul

15,01Intense

15,01Intense vibrations of inactivity
15,01A loathing feeling of nothing
15,01Emptiness from within
15,01Which reflects on the surroundings       
15,01An Emptiness absolute that drowns
15,01Yet you remain in that situation
15,01Not because it comforts you       
15,01Not because it's convenient       
15,01But you have something to prove

15,01An illegal gamble and the prize is pride
15,01Though shredded you still cling
15,01Hanging to a rotton slab of meat
15,01To a vomit drenched rag
15,01Your pride can't be bought nor traded

15,01It is yours alone to keep
