15,01Leaving Me

15,01I thought we'd always be together,
15,01I had so many dreams for us,
15,01Sitting up on a mountain top,
15,01Watching birds fly by,
15,01Feeling the cool breezes,
15,01Smelling the fresh clean air,
15,01Looking below at the world,
15,01And knowing that it took
15,01a while for us to get here,
15,01I don't know what to do now,
15,01You've left me with so many things,
15,01You're presence will always be
15,01here with me,
15,01I can't erase this feeling
15,01of loneliness,
15,01Please come back to me.
