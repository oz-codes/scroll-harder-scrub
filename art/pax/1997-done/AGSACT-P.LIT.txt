15,01Into the blistered void
15,01she sticks her finger,
15,01my love the nail+biter,
15,01the forehead thrasher,
15,01embracer of chemists' plaster.

15,01Tiny cries from the bites of tiny teeth
15,01in the ovarian vacuum,
15,01the kick of the planetoid
15,01amplifies with echoes.
15,01Blood seeps into linen and rots,

15,01papyroid dressings shrink and crumble.
15,01Brown edges curl away
15,01from the whorls of her fingerprints,
15,01puckered and white as if from
15,01strangulation, resting on pillows

15,01of mucous doubt, quiescent treatment.
15,01In sleep she snores and dreams 
15,01of purple+black plum skin ripped
15,01from yellow meat, 
15,01flies and iodine.

15,01======================================

15,01In a familliar hell, I rest
15,01Better than the soil I would test:
15,01Manic hopes and depressive slides
15,01A roller coaster I will not abide

15,01But the sun shines on a pale eye
15,01THe clouds drift slowly from the sky
15,01While I await the next storm-fall
15,01I gather the flowers, growing tall

15,01I tell myself that under frosty looks
15,01I will press them into picture books
15,01To run my frozen fingers along
15,01Singing my nursery/funeral song

15,01Walking a limbo between sun and rain
15,01I find the roots of hope again
15,01My old enemy may cure the marks
15,01That leave me shuddering in the dark.

15,01So what path would you have me walk
15,01Tho my feet stumble and balk?
15,01Well-known muck clinging to soles
15,01Or an illusionary road of the whole?

15,01Tread lightly on the soul, my dear.
15,01It carries wear a long, long time
15,01and can't be cleaned, I fear.
15,01Too permanent, that grime.
