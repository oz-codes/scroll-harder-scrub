15,01We all have our almost loves, don't we?

15,01******************************************

15,01You should be lying here
15,01Next to me.
15,01These slow words and bongo beats filling
15,01the space between the incense smoke
15,01and your body next to mine.
15,01Skin, burning against the sheets
15,01The candle that caresses the archane designs
15,01On these walls as your hands
15,01Flickering over my streched body.
15,01        A humming guitar string
15,01        Waiting for your fingers to make it sing
15,01I've been waiting for this touch 
15,01Since I was a virginial 15.
15,01 
15,01Your laugh moves over me
15,01As you drift over my body
15,01Singing this dream into being.

15,01**************************************************

15,01High above our bent heads
15,01and the rounded river stones                          (or so I imagine)
15,01The eagle's scream rips across the sky        (or her ears or my heart)
15,01She streches her arms and opens
15,01Wide wide wide like she can hold the
15,01Cloud-bubble with the trees scratching             
15,01and the black twirling leaf eagle                         (scavenger?)
15,01Her soul soars and screams on the currents
15,01And her face is open to the winds
15,01Of a feathered brotherhood                 (she's unlucky with sisters)
15,01 
15,01And I sit stone-turned like a
15,01Little rabbit wondering if
15,01this is a hunting dance or mating dance
15,01my heart beats an ancient drum               (excitement: all the same)
15,01Pen in my hand and
15,01Heart in my eyes
15,01I ache I ache to strech my arms
15,01Wide like hers to hold her close
15,01But she's up there soaring
15,01my wild-eagle woman
15,01And I'm grounded....                                 (but my poems fly)
