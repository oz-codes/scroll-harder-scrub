15,01The user of this test acknowledges that sex is a hazardous sport; that a person
15,01must copulate in control, and use good judgement at all times; that partners'
15,01conditions vary constantly and are greatly affected by weather changes and
15,01previous use; and that dirty sheets, variations in terrain and bed surfaces,
15,01spouses/pimps/managers, forest growth, rocks and debris, clothed obstacles, and
15,01many other natural and man-made obstacles and hazards, including other users
15,01and customers, exist throughout the bedroom area.  Personal managers
15,01(pimps/spouses) and sado-masochistic operations and equipment are constantly in
15,01use and may be hazardous to those not copulating in control.  Impotence,
15,01collisions, and social diseases resulting in injury can happen at any time,
15,01even to those copulating in control with proper sexual equipment.  Inherent
15,01risks are part of the sport and may exist within your partner.  As a condition
15,01of being permitted to use the facilities of your partner, the user of this test
15,01agrees to copulate in control and within the limits of his/her ability, and
15,01further acknowledges and accepts these hazards, dangers, and risks and assumes
15,01the risk of injury or loss to person or damage to property which might result
15,01from use of the partner's facilities.

15,01As a further condition of being permitted to use the facilities of your
15,01partner, the customer understands and agrees that:  (1) in the event of a
15,01transfer of use by another or anything else in the management's opinion is
15,01misconduct, misuse, kinky, impotence, or nuisance, this service may be revoked
15,01without refund; (2) the partner is the property of the harem and, upon request,
15,01s/he must be presented to any authorized representative of the pimp/spouse; (3)
15,01sexual equipment must be visibly displayed at all times when you are in any
15,01bedroom and when approaching the bed to copulate.  Your sexual partner is not
15,01transferable; see Theft of Services, V.S.A., sections 2581 and 2582.
