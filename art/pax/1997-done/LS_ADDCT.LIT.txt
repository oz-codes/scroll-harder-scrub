15,01The Addiction

15,01She paints her eyes
15,01Her lips
15,01Her cheeks
15,01Thinking it hides the pain
15,01The pain I imposed
15,01I wish it didn't turn out like this
15,01How could I have known
15,01I should have known
15,01So young
15,01So impressionable
15,01Me able to resist
15,01While she is caught
15,01Heroine now her best friend
