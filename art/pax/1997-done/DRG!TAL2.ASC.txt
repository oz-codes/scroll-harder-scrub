15,01this isnt really a tale, but i can tell you that "someone" threw a thunder
15,01king into a trashcan at school today. the smoke was so extensive the entire
15,01room filled up with it, and the smokealarm went off. the school really really
15,01want to know who did this, and starts scheming that someone was almost hit
15,01by small metal particles when "someone" blew a thunder king in the same trash-
15,01can yesterday or something to that effect. i know thats bullshit as i was there
15,01the first time, and know very well what was happening there the second time.
15,01its all bullshit, you know. the system is fucking with us. when they dont have
15,01enuff evidence to support what they think, they make new evidence to make their
15,01case sound better. its pathetic. sheesh. anyways, me, joda and ronny are prolly
15,01the first people to be associated with this if the coppers are involved, as we
15,01were caught shooting rockets at jodas ass last saturday. its all really funny,
15,01actually, since i didnt really do shit. neither did joda or ronny, so for once
15,01we are actually innocent. whee hoe. but the problem, though, is that if "they"
15,01get the one(s) who did it, he/she/they will get fined 4000 kroners. whEE! oh
15,01we love the system, now dont we?
