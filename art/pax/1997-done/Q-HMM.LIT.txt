15,01   what is this altered state of mind in which i reside?
15,01   when the only dreams that come are of fatigue and worthlessness.
15,01   
15,01      ...but even these threads of connection to reality have been
15,01         long lost in the fury of an idle mind.

15,01   what is the right path for me?  and is it the path i want to follow.

15,01                ...i can only sit on the edge for so long...

15,01            ...i can only sit on this god damned edge for so fucking long...

15,01       ...i can only sit on the edge.
