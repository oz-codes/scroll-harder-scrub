15,01Our country reeks of trees,
15,01Our yaks are really large, 
15,01And they smell like rotting beef caracasses.
15,01And we have to clean up after them,
15,01And our saddle sores are the best,
15,01We proudly wear women's clothing,
15,01And searing sands blow up our skirts.
15,01And the buzzards; they soar overhead,
15,01And poisonous snakes will devour us whole,
15,01Our bones will bleach in the sun.
15,01And we will probably go to HELL,                  -FART
15,01But that is our great reward,
15,01For being the-uh royal,
15,01Canadian Kilted Yaksmen.
