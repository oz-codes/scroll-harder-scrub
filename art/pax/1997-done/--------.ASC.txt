15,01here I stand so close to you
15,01my heart running so wild, feeling so warm,
15,01captured by your eyes, comfort
15,01god is pulling us together

15,01lightning, rain

15,01a cry, an open heart, you let that sword come out
15,01boring itself the way through my chest
15,01your tears begin to wander, you were just fooling around with me,
15,01moving, endlessly sorry, not knowing why ever poured

15,01birds, the sun

15,01tears don't fit you, no need to cry
15,01a glimpse at your true heart and I'm captured by your eyes
15,01So I'm happy already with your
15,01smile
