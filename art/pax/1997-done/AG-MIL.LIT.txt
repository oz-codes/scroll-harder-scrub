15,01   who here will follow? a piece of something different, i hope.

15,01   where are the alter egos? right here, I do not adhere to anything. from the
15,01periphery of my cushioned chair things are breaking.... mother is going to 
15,01change her name to angelica (sp?) and burn down the house. this is very true; 
15,01she is looking for anne's and peter's mercy street. the house is falling 
15,01apart. now the dining room table, the old center of communication, hold pools 
15,01of water from the leaking roof.

15,01   where are the postings of dreams people have? I stole a picture with my
15,01friend last night. the law was after us; his car began to run without gas; we 
15,01reached the edge of decorum (a blueberry yougurt, purple, mountain). 

15,01    sam used to drive the highway for hours and hours when his facade was 
15,01peeling. i'm sure he laughed the whole way. what's there to be upset about? my
15,01teacher, stan, laughs about Rwanda and Kabul, but investigates as much info
15,01pertaining to those situations as he can; otherwise, and this is the
15,01impression I get, he'd turn his back on the world and sulk to death.

15,01 we are all destined to long draughts of aloness, whether we visit 4 
15,01continents or remain in pastel neighbourhoods. 

15,01  this forum of messages includes so many people, yet it is small. I call for 
15,01your imaginations to colonize these screens, with or without Reason. 


15,01 if you encounter an old man named keith and he asks for paper towels
15,01do not give him any: he eats them, and cannot stop himself once he gets 
15,01started.
