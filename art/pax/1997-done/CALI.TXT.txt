15,01My friends (Tussse and VAmonkey) and I (mordecai) have done some
15,01funny rap parodies before but we decided to try our hand at it
15,01with blender ... so we did a parody of California Love.

15,01These are the original lyrics:

15,01Artist: 2Pac f/ Dr. Dre
15,01Album:  All Eyez on Me
15,01Song:   California Love

15,01California love!

15,011-California...knows how to party
15,01  California...knows how to party
15,01  In the citaaay of L.A.
15,01  In the citaaay of good ol' Watts
15,01  In the citaaay, the city of Compton
15,01  We keep it rockin!  We keep it rockin!

15,01Verse One: Dr. Dre

15,01Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west  
15,01A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
15,01The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest  
15,01Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
15,01We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat 
15,01the state where ya never find a dance floor empty
15,01And pimps be on a mission for them greens 
15,01lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
15,01I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes 
15,01ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
15,01Now it's '95  and they clock me and watch me 
15,01Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
15,01It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay  
15,01Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
15,01Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way  
15,01Dre puttin it down for 
15,01Californ-i-a
15,01(repeat 1)

15,012-Shake it shake it baby
15,01  Shake it shake it baby
15,01  Shake it shake it mama
15,01  Shake it Cali
15,01  Shake it shake it baby
15,01  Shake it shake it shake it shake it...

15,01Verse Two: 2Pac

15,01Out on bail fresh outta jail 
15,01California dreamin
15,01Soon as I stepped on the scene 
15,01I'm hearin hoochies screamin
15,01Fiendin for money and alcohol
15,01the life of a west side playa where cowards die
15,01Only in Cali where we riot now rallies are live and die  
15,01In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
15,01Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
15,01Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
15,01Famous cause we program worldwide 
15,01Let'em recognize from Longbeach to Rosecrans
15,01Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side 
15,01So you know the row won't bow down to no man
15,01Say what you say 
15,01But give me that bomb beat from Dre 
15,01Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
15,01From Oakland to Sacktown 
15,01The Bay Area and back down
15,01Cali is where they put they mack down
15,01Give me love!
15,01(rpt 1)

15,01(dre) now make it shake...

15,01(rpt 2)

15,01Here is our funny lyrics using the blender words:

15,01Artist: Killer Angels
15,01Album:  stress the M+S
