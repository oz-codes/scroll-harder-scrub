15,01        responce string, and then followed by a integer between 1 to 15,s,

15,01                By having this, every time "You Have Died." is displayed on
15,01        the screen, it will be in Red. The color system is as follows:

15,01                1 = Dark Blue
15,01                2 = Dark GreenT-D]

15,01        First you must have a fossil driver installed. I have included
15,01        THE ~ CHARACTER:is a fossil driver which has been tested with Fate
15,01                By putting the ~ Character and then an integer value, whenever
15,01        the search string is found, the place where the "~integer" is in the
15,01        responce will be relaced by the word on the line that corresponds to
15,01        the integer. So say you put "~2" then the second word would be placed
15,01        in there. Such as, say the line that is being searched is "DarkMan
15,01        has attacked you", and your search and responce was as follows:
15,01"Fate /Config", this will start fate up but it will bring you to a menu
15,01                Search String #1[On] :d and com port.
15,01                has attacked you
15,01                Responce String :
15,01                Attack ~1
15,012) Change Com Port
15,01                Then Every find of "has attacked you" will grab the first word
15,01        on that current line. Such as the name, then when the responce is
15,01        "Attack ~1", it will respond "Attack DarkMan".

15,01        By pressing 1 you will be able to change the Baud Rate, by pressing
