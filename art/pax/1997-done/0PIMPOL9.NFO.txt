15,01   And now, the Noname storytime corner. This month's host: The Prodigy.

15,01Alright... A man is driving down a country road.   He drives by a beat-up old
15,01farm.  He takes a look at the farm, and he sees a man fucking a sheep. Though
15,01naturally disgusted, he drives up to the house next to the farm.  He gets out
15,01of his car,  and knocks on the door.  A girl steps out. The man says " I'm so
15,01sorry to bother you,  but there's a man fucking a sheep over by that farm! ".
15,01The girl looks over,  shrugs her shoulders, and says " Oh, no problem. That's
15,01just my dAAAAAd. "

15,01hey!? let go of me!?@ where the hell are you taking me!?@? nOOO!@

15,01(uhm, enjoy the pack.)

15,01--- umm, cain babbles about the boyees and the news or something..

15,01 - IllWilliam, The Silent Killer, and Point Blank are all new to the tribe
15,01   this month.  anyone whom i missed, please forgive me gravely, this pack
15,01   is quite rushed.
15,01 - Mr. Madness deserves MAD props from the noname crew, he has been time &
15,01   time again forgotten to be mentioned in the packs, so, from the crew we
15,01   apologize.
15,01 - umm, tHE dEEP is up.. you can reach it at 403-246-1174.. and the nup is
15,01   gUPPIE .. so give it a call, leave me a message if you know me and i'll
15,01   hook you up.


15,01        And so it is true, only the best can have an off month, because most of
15,01the pimps this month, have found a life, and spent to much time partying.. so
15,01you all have to admit that this *IS* a good excuse, even i slacked off for the
15,01first time in a long time.  oh well.

15,01 ...anyone seen savage dragon?...

15,01 Greets fly out to: Remorse1981


15,01        HAHAHA, this is a fun info file you know.  i enjoy writing bullshit all
15,01over my aciddraw screen.  as you all directly should know, this is the second
15,01book of the noname pimpedia, the phearsome cursum purgatario pimpin. henceforth
15,01let us all join together to sing in admiration, the anthem of the noname pimps,
15,01let the warriors come together to form the soultrain, so we may march down,
15,01chanting Vexilla Pimpis Prodeunt.  and so it begins..
