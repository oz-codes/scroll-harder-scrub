15,01If I could only find a way to keep this dreary world at bay
15,01I'd crawl within myself and be content. 
15,01For deep within's a harmony, the essence and the heart of me, 
15,01but now the walls are cracked, my spirit's bent.

15,01And, oh...  I wonder... 
15,01As I sit, I just ponder... 
15,01Searching for a way to ease my crumbling sanity.

15,01It seems that every single day this world just wants to chip away 
15,01my heart, my very soul, it won't relent. 
15,01I search in vain to find the key, but there's no way out that I can see,
15,01And so I'm caught up in this cruel descent.

15,01And oh... I wander 
15,01Amid the gray clouds, the thunder... 
15,01hoping for a way to save my shattered sanity. 

15,01No matter what I do or say, my spirit seems to slip away
15,01into this raging pit of such torment. 
15,01My days are filled with misery, the nightfall brings such agony 
15,01so to this tragic fate I just consent.

15,01And oh... I wander
15,01through  this life gone asunder...
15,01knowing there's no hope at all for my insanity.
