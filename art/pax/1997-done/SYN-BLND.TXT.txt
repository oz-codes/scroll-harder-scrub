15,01dn't definately tell. He walked up the driveway and tripped over the un-even con
15,01crete. "FUCKIN SHIT" Doug yelled, "this mutherfuckin day sucks!" He neared the h
15,01ouse and as he neared he heard loud music coming from inside and saw many people
15,01 dancing around, not just dancing but slamming into each other. Doug figured fuc
15,01k it, I may as well knock.  He knocked and some kid answered, he looked to be ab

15,01local suit place and he looked outta place.  After walking through the house for
15,01 a while being introduced to many people, they offered him some black clothes an

15,01s chances with, he smoked it and felt fuckin great.. then he drank many beers an
