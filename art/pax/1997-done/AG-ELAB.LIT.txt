15,01 elaboration on a late morning dream I had this morning (my first intense
15,01objective death dream; by objective I mean it wasn't my death)


15,01  Super Market


15,01Safeway Butchers 
15,01two aisles down from the towels
15,01demonstrate to the public
15,01the meaty secret:

15,01         All Products Sold On These Shelves
15,01         Are Dead. To Prove Ourselves
15,01         We Will Exhibit, With Knife and Tenderizer,
15,01         Our Personal Brand of Killing.
15,01                                     
15,01The older shoppers were flushed with memories
15,01of their fathers
15,01after back-yard battles with the chicken coop
15,01bloody and sweaty, 
15,01bird in one hand, beer in the other.

15,01"you know", one muttered to another, "you lose something from styrofoam
15,01                                                            platters."

15,01 the skeptical asked,
15,01 "when does it start"

15,01 "right now, if you like", the intercom marked

15,01 
15,01like Noah's Ark they came out
15,01from soup cans and freezers
15,01slithering off sausage wheels
15,01to be killed again, to prove a promise

15,01cubic cows and chicken fingers
15,01built themselves into altars on the Butcher's table
15,01fish shuddered and shed their batter
15,01found their heads behind Customer Service Counter

15,01all lined up, incomplete, in pieces
15,01afternoon shoppers applauded,
15,01a human horseshoe around the Block
15,01considered themselves lucky - first store with live chops

15,01worms flew through the automatic doors

15,01up went the cleaver
15,01split a cow tongue
15,01back up it glittered, a splash of red
15,01back down on turkey hearts
15,01beating, red explosions

15,01"such tiny hearts"


15,01the customers who'd brought their dogs
15,01ran out fast to their cars

15,01"I have something not already dead-dead,
15,01 it might help with customer relations"


15,01"you think like gold", the intercom joked
15,01"but who eats dog"

15,01         ("I'll do it with Coke!")

15,01Shepherds, terriers, poodles and muts
15,01"we got a ten-year old bag of peanuts.
15,01might go nice with paws dipped in honey sauce"
15,01said the manager, everyone's new friend

15,01the leashes were sold, a dollar for ten
15,01"Use 'em for strangling, whipping; buy 'em for a friend"
15,01little sara cried, "he was such a good pup"
15,01mother replied, "no he's not. I got hair in my eye and shit in my mouth"
