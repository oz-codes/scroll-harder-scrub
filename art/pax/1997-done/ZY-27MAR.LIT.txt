15,0127 March, Kanoya, Kyushu.

15,01The future bones of past explorers are drying on a rock.
15,01Shells sucked clean of creatures will soon be at home
15,01on part of a poem
15,01by Basho, made into a plate by an old woman.
15,01I am liking the desperation of my situation,
15,01pruned trees crying out to be memorized,
15,01cloistered hens tutting in Japanese.
15,01In 800 years this place will be just right;
15,01the bamboo too wide for me to span,
15,01the strawberry plants climbing over the fence.

15,01And 800 years will pass, they will go on,
15,01the show will not be postponed.
15,01Descendants of the tiny bug on my arm will continue
15,01to live in this garden of rocks and weeds.
