15,01               SYMPTOMS OF SEMESTER BURNOUT!

15,011.   When your parents inquire about your grades and you sing the cookie
15,01     monster song (C is for cookie, that's good enough for me...)

15,012.   You have spent more time figuring out that you only need a 54% on
15,01     the final to pass than you have actually spent studing.

15,013.   When you are swamped with homework and spend your time making up a
15,01     list like this.

15,014.   When you start showering after class rather than before.

15,015.   The test papers are no longer worthy of the fridge door.

15,016.   When the campus drunk tells you you should study more.

15,017.   When your favorite paperweight says "Bud Light"

15,018.   Visions of the upcoming weekend help you to make it through Monday.

15,019.   When your absence exceeds your attendance.

15,0110.  When your study schedule is based on the rationale that you "might"
15,01     actually die before the test!
