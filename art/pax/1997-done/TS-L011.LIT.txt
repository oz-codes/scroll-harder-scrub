15,01        Pieces of you

15,01My love tell me how will I live
15,01A life so empty and lost
15,01When my life is brought together,
15,01By pieces of you.

15,01How will I wake up each morning
15,01When my day has no reason to go on.
15,01Tell me where will I find the words
15,01To make you come back to me.

15,01Where will I find the tenderness
15,01That fills my heart with warmth.
15,01I will walk to the ends of the world,
15,01That I may kiss your lips again

15,01Where are you now my love,
15,01In this cold and lonely world.
15,01Tell me how long must I wait
15,01Until you free me from this pain.
