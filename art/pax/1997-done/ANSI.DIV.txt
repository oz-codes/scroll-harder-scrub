15,01<psy> yeah
15,01<mafesto> kinda restores my faith 
15,01  in ansi group mentality ...
15,01<psy> no.. i think riot is better 
15,01  .. =) (if u wanna fight im here)
15,01<psy> do u draw ansi.. i have seen 
15,01  just an ansi from u in aif pack.. 
15,01  do u contribute to the pack? NO!
15,01<mafesto> yes, but i've released in 
15,01  all the packs since i joined, 
15,01  haven't i?
15,01<psy> ok man.. if u wont to be in 
15,01  aif u can quit.. i wont dudes who 
15,01  fuck's with aif .. in aif
15,01<psy> just vga.. u joined as ansi too
15,01<psy> and ascii
15,01<mafesto> heavin forbid i have to 
15,01  release in all the mediums i 
15,01  signed up for.
15,01<psy> ok.. but.. why are u fucking 
15,01  with aif?
15,01<mafesto> why would i waste my time 
15,01  fucking w/ aif?  i don't know why 
15,01  you'd think that.
15,01<psy> <mafesto> well .. aif is 
15,01  really moving along nicely now, 
15,01  isn't it?
15,01<psy> is it nice to a group that 
15,01  u're in?
15,01<psy> but.. why riot hasnt released?
15,01<mafesto> because there is no riot 
15,01  ... riot died because we found 
15,01  another group w/ the same name .. 
15,01  so i actually joined groups 
15,01  rather than starting my own .. 
15,01  but i rather liked the idea of my 
15,01  own group, cause i never got 
15,01  jerked around by anyone.
15,01<psy> what groups u joined?
15,01<mafesto> aif/impact.
15,01<psy> impact is an inactivity 
15,01  group.. hahahha.. its too elite
15,01<mafesto> oh really?  just you wait 
15,01  .. we've got a SHITLOAD of stuff 
15,01  this month .. lemme see.. i've 
15,01  got an ascii, an ansi, AND a 
15,01  vga.. imagine that.  wow.
15,01<psy> oh yeah.. its too elite.. oh.. 
15,01  AN ANSI.. (your ansis really rox, 
15,01  no?) , an ascii (rox too) and vga 
15,01  .. (not too bad.. but ratan is 
15,01  better)
15,01<mafesto> HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA so you're 
15,01  saying i suck then!!!  woohoo!!!! 
15,01  thanks! :)
15,01<mafesto> nice ascii/ansi .. ever 
15,01  think of devoloping a new style?
15,01<psy> new style? bah.. do u call it 
15,01  as new style?
15,01<psy> i hate who fucks with aif
15,01<mafesto> what i mean by new style 
15,01  is WHY THE FUCK DO ALL YOUR ANSI 
15,01  PICS LOOK THE SAME?!
15,01<psy> oh yeah.. i do ansi pics.. and 
15,01  u ?? do u do? NO!
15,01<mafesto> maybe i'm a fontist.. 
15,01  maybe i released a pic w/ impact 
15,01  this month .. maybe you'll never 
15,01  know, will you?  maybe i spent an 
15,01  hour on all my ansis i've ever 
15,01  released with aif, and most of 
15,01  that was choosing who to greet in 
15,01  my grafix.
15,01<psy> fontist.. bah.. your ansis 
15,01  arent cool to call it as font! 
15,01  pic.. ahah.. u? just if it sux.. 
15,01  ahha.. u havent released ansis in 
15,01  aif.. (do u call them as ansi? )
15,01<mafesto> hahah .. then why does 
15,01  everyone make fun of your shit?
