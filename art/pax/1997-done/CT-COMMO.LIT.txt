15,01COMMONPLACE

15,01I'd see your eyes and hold your hands -
15,01our fingers free of wedding bands.
15,01Such token things our love surpassed,
15,01but worst - the rings would longer last.

15,01I'd smell your breath and taste your lips.
15,01You'd guide my hands around your hips
15,01and almost could I love again;
15,01and almost could I pass the pain.

15,01Reality'd grow blurred and dim;
15,01You her would be as I would him.
15,01I'd hold you tight and hear your heart.
15,01Through skin alone we'd be apart.

15,01I can't forget, so can't proceed -
15,01we've split because of common need.
15,01I hear your voice and see your face
15,01but now they're simply commonplace.
