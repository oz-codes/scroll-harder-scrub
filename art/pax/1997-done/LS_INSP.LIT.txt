15,01Inspire Me

15,01  How does one go about writing poetry for someone who you don't know?  Maybe
15,01you find this to be an easy task, but I most certainly do not.  My poetry
15,01comes from my heart.  My words are my feelings, my verse my emotions.  So
15,01everything I write is everything I feel, and everything I feel is everything
15,01you read.  So when I am asked to write for those I don't know, I find it 
15,01difficult because these names evoke no emotions, their words bring about no
15,01feelings.  Perhaps one day we will be close; friends never wanting to part.
15,01When that day comes you will inspire me, but right now I just can't write for
15,01you.
15,01  Wait, if you don't mind I would like to take this chance to correct myself.
15,01I once said that I could not write for those I don't know, due to a lack of
15,01inspiration.  But as we see from this small compilation of words, you did
15,01provide me with what I needed to write.  Your simple appreciation of my work
15,01provided a spark, and subsequently my mind and pen caught fire.  I thank you
15,01from providing the inspiration for my latest work, and look forward to the
15,01day we can meet.

15,01- This was written to the friends of my girlfriend.. She lives in Long Island
15,01  and I in Staten Island so we don't get to spend much time together.. I do
15,01  however write for her, and her me.. Her friends have seen the shit I've 
15,01  done for her, and they wanted me to write for them.. The above explains the
15,01  thought process I went through as I tried to write for them..
