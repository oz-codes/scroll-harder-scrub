15,01I'll fade away into your smile
15,01Just feeling guilty for a while
15,01For love can be the strangest thing
15,01Happiness or misery is what love brings
15,01You've choose to love me
15,01I don't know why
15,01I just needed to fill the void inside
15,01So I told you that I could hold your hand
15,01But my pain, you'll never understand
