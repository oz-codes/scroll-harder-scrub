15,01probably you wonder why there's no logo in this ansi.. well, the reason is
15,01simple: i suck at logos. :) mass murderer/ice/fire is supposed to draw a
15,01"da mouldy vaults" logo for it, that's why the name is dmv. Cirion, be sure
15,01to get that promised 200+ liner..

15,01some quick greets to all dudes here at mekka, my pals in ethos9, ice and
15,01mean scheme, the ana-k honks, black maiden, fuel, fire, twilight, and ...
15,01ah, you know who i mean.. :)

15,01some stats about the ansi:
15,01200 lines since 200 lines are the maximum allowed. I'm sure I could have done
15,01350, but well.. The drawing time is about 15 hours, which is quite fast for
15,01my relation. That's because of the big problem I had: I wanted to draw
15,01small eyes, but the first three attempts sucked, since the head should take
15,01half a screen as maximum in the width. Finally I had to give up my plan and
15,01draw the head a little bigger. The consequence was a huge body as well, and
15,01so the body is full of large areas, which are incredibly hard to shade. It's
15,01more easy to shade little areas fer sure! Well, the result is a shading which
15,01looks like a very simple one, but it isn't. This kind of shading hardly looks
15,01good, and you've to find out a combination which is bearable.
15,01The third big problem I had was the skirt: I really couldn't make it look 
15,01vivid, though I tried. It rather looks like a completely different part. Well,
15,01so I shaded it a little different to back up this impression. Since the
15,01comic original was black&white, not shaded, I had to choose the colours/the
15,01light source on my own, that's why it sucks that much. :) I changed some
15,01parts, especially the face, from the original, since ansi has its own des-
15,01trictions. The hardest problem was that I was out of practise. Well, now I'm
15,01back in, heh.. :)
