15,01What 20 minutes
15,01of scrubbing can't.
15,01The painted grease is coming off
15,01and staining the rags of you
15,01I have twined round my fingers.
15,01yet, somehow, you wash clean...
15,01these scraps are all i dare hold
15,01in the moments of shudders
15,01that echo like earthquakes.
15,01perhaps, i shall continue
15,01to weave in my child's way
15,01and this will be one tapestry
15,01I won't have to burn.
