15,01          As most oph you know, wicked has not released a pack in the past
15,01     two months... this is mostly my phault due to the phact that i went
15,01     away to school and did not leaphe anyone in charge of the group...
15,01     just because wicked hasn't released in two months does not mean that
15,01     we are ophicially dead... i plan on haphing many years with wicked...
15,01     this is our two year anniphersary pack!!  i compiled the best of
15,01     everyones asciis, and made it into their own personal collection...
15,01     i haphen't been in touch with the members, but i plan to change all
15,01     oph that starting right now... i haphe phinally phinished setting up
15,01     my web site... my board disembodied voices has expanded onto the web...
15,01     iph you would like to check it out its located at www.disembodied.com.
15,01     i think the site will make it easier for artists around the world to
15,01     contact me as well as all oph the other members oph wicked...
15,01     seperated we dissolve, united we conquer... iph it is possible i
15,01     would like all members to be active on the site so we can all keep
15,01     up to date...  i guess thats bout it... wicked, united we stand...
