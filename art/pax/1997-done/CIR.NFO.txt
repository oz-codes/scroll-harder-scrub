15,01  o Some CIR History :

15,01        CIR began out as some lame ass K-Rad group. Yes, I must admit, it did.
15,01It's the truth. Then, as time went by and we grew (in age and maturity, and
15,01not in size, since our size only grew slowly) we started changing. We went
15,01through a lot of stages. And, finally settled down to what we are now. Some,
15,01undefined path.

15,01        What CIR does basically is CT (Chaos Times) ezine. Which pretty much
15,01represents CIR ideology. And, is a pretty neat thing to check out if you ask
15,01me. It's the ezine I've always wanted to find on the net or any bbs. And, well
15,01I put it out myself now.

15,01        LK is currently taking care of some Art Pack shit. Which is more on
15,01the "l337" shit, but you know, art is art. I don't participate, since I
15,01don't do art. But, hey, it's welcomed in CIR. We believe that if you have
15,01a talent then it should be improved. And not looked down at like some kid
15,01porn shit.

15,01  o Who is CIR :

15,01    kuru = President. I'm the one who blabbers the most <g>

15,01    biggdogg / rooster / lightning knight / loknes / elihu / akira

15,01    As you might notice, we're a small group. We will remain small. It's
15,01    easier to maintain. And that's why we have no vice president, etc.

15,01                                                                kuru
