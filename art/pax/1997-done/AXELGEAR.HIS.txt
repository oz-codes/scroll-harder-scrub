15,01 Here is a short run through of my history on the underground computer scene.

15,01 14-----

03,01 1991   


15,01        One day I was playing Tradewars 2002 on a local bulletin board system 
15,01when the sysop broke into chat with me. He told me that someone had screwed 
15,01with my access levels and he was going to fix it. Well he must have pressed a
15,01wrong key because his entire warez file menu came into view. He immedately 
15,01hung up on me. When I came back an hour later there was an email telling me 
15,01that since I had seen his warez section he had no choice but to give me access,
15,01as long as I told no one else.


03,01 1992


15,01        I downloaded and uploaded warez constantly for over a year with my
15,01slick 2400 bps. modem. I had seen works from Acid and Ice and really wanted
15,01to try my hand at ansi. Since the warez scene and art scene were co-dependant
15,01at this time (artists drew for warez boards, warez couriers moved art packs)
15,01it was pretty easy to get into the art scene. I changed my name from Soundster
15,01to Shattered Link at this time.


03,01 1993


15,01        Well, to put it plainly, I sucked. I couldn't draw worth shit, and I
15,01think I ripped a few ansis too. About late-1993 I finally got decent enough
15,01to join a local 619 (San Diego, California) group named Chaos/2. Most groups'
15,01names at this time were acronyms. Chaos/2 stood for Cracking Hacking And Other
15,01Shit. I became the ansi coordinator for Chaos/2 because I drew the app-gen
15,01screens. Needless to say, the group was doomed from the start. We couldn't
15,01find any suppliers for warez because most people thought we were trying to
15,01copy the successful art group, Chaos. Chaos/2 died a quick and painless death,
15,01sending talented ansi artists such as P-Chan (Ice), Liquid Vision (Ex-Cia),
15,01and Dynosaw (Ex-Shiver) in different directions.


03,01 1994

15,01        After Chaos/2 died, a flood of new ansi groups popped up in the 619
15,01scene. Of these groups I joined Punk, Unity (Not the big one), Studio-X, and
15,01Pro. Some of the people I hung around with in these groups were Asylum, 
15,01Floodmyth, and Cyric (MrKite). Shiver, a extremely popular national group,
15,01saw the talent in Pro and decided to merge. And that's how I got myself out
15,01of the local scene and into the big one.


03,01 1995


15,01        I got on IRC at this time with the Shiver guest account (Shiver95)
15,01and hung around #ansi until the account died. I drew a ton of of works for
15,01Shiver and became one of the more recognized artists in Shiver. I was invited
15,01to quite a few small groups, but I declined, thinking Shiver was going to be
15,01around forever. I was wrong.

15,01        During the final three months of Shiver's existence, I drew alot more
15,01than I normally did. The Guardian told me that had it not been for the extra
15,01effort that people like me put out, Shiver would have collapsed much earlier.

15,01        I contributed to Lord Jazz's non-member-everyone-can-release-group,
15,01Bleach, and later joined it when it converted to a normal ansi group. I had
15,01getting into coding at this time, and Lord Jazz and I were planning to make 
15,01a Bleach electronic magazine called Tide, but it never happened. I got alot
15,01of calls from Betrayer at this time asking me to join Saga, but I declined.

15,01        Well Bleach fell through and so I went to take Betrayer up on the offer
15,01he made. Communication was horrible and he ended up calling me at odd hours of
15,01the night. Three days before Saga's fateful merge into Acid, Betrayer signed me
15,01up for Saga. Talking recently to Ellisdee, it appears that I was never 
15,01technically a member since all hell was breaking loose during those final       
15,01hours.
