15,01 "I don't care if it rains or freezes,
15,01  'long as I' got my plastic Jesus,
15,01  sittin' on the dashboard of my car;
15,01  It makes no difference if we hit a bump,
15,01  -he's held on by a suction cup,
15,01  sittin' on the dashboard of my car;
15,01  I can even go a hund'rd miles-an-hour,
15,01  as long as I've got that dee-vine power,
15,01  sittin' on the dashboard of my car."
