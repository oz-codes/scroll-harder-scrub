13,01explanation : it's like this. i'm real trendy, so i decided to attempt to do a
13,01so-called "abstract ansi" cause their in style now. anyways, if you can't tell
13,01it's kermit the frog, vomiting in the men's washroom 

13,01THIS IS WRONG!!!!

13,01kermit is a frog. he should be in the frog's washroom, not the men's...but face
13,01it, thats what blenders all about. taking a person, and putting them somewhere
13,01that they normally wouldn't be, doing an action that they normally wouldn't do.
13,01not only is it an extention of the imagination. but it contains wholesome family
13,01values, and bad jokes as shown above...greetz to: hennifer + samReye (guess why)
