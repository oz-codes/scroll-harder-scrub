15,01Created by Jason Lisle


15,01Due to the enormous workload involved in physics classes combined with
15,01stress and lack of sleep, physics students often forget (either by
15,01accident, defense mechanism, or intentionally) what their major really
15,01is.  Thus, as a physics major, I took it upon myself to create a small
15,01list of indicators to help us all remember what we really are.


15,01YOU MIGHT BE A PHYSICS MAJOR...

15,01if you have no life - and you can PROVE it mathematically.

15,01if you enjoy pain.

15,01if you know vector calculus but you can't remember how to do long division.

15,01if you chuckle whenever anyone says "centrifugal force."

15,01if you've actually used every single function on your graphing calculator.

15,01if when you look in a mirror, you see a physics major.

15,01if it is sunny and 70 degrees outside, and you are working on a computer.

15,01if you frequently whistle the theme song to "MacGyver."

15,01if you always do homework on Friday nights.

15,01if you know how to integrate a chicken and can take the derivative of water.

15,01if you think in "math."

15,01if you've calculated that the World Series actually diverges.

15,01if you hesitate to look at something because you don't want to break down
15,01its wave function.

15,01if you have a pet named after a scientist.

15,01if you laugh at jokes about mathematicians.

15,01if the Humane society has you arrested because you actually performed the
15,01Schrodinger's Cat experiment.

15,01if you can translate English into Binary.

15,01if you can't remember what's behind the door in the science building
15,01which says "Exit."

15,01if you have to bring a jacket with you, in the middle of summer, because
15,01there's a wind-chill factor in the lab.

15,01If you are completely addicted to caffeine.

15,01if you avoid doing anything because you don't want to contribute to the
15,01eventual heat-death of the universe.

15,01if you consider ANY non-science course "easy."

15,01if when your professor asks you where your homework is, you claim to have
15,01accidentally determined its momentum so precisely, that according to
15,01Heisenberg it could be anywhere in the universe.

15,01if the "fun" center of your brain has deteriorated from lack of use.

15,01if you'll assume that a "horse" is a "sphere" in order to make the math
15,01easier.

15,01if you understood more than five of these indicators.

15,01if you make a hard copy of this list, and post it on your door.


15,01If these indicators apply to you, there is good reason to suspect that
15,01you might be classified as a physics major.  I hope this clears up any
15,01confusion.
