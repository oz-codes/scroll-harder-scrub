15,01     "It's Wu-Tang motherfuck, mm yah, it's Wu-Tang motherfucker", it was Spice1

15,01stereorag boosting away. Everybody at the party place, in the secret #klan area,

15,01was totally stoned from Cakes "bag-pibe". This new invention from Cake, that
15,01it was mushrooms that were to be smoked had been received with some sceptisism.
15,01Acctually Flower didn't want to smoke the mushies at first, but after all little

15,01competition he had to agree with the "bag-pibe" trick. Hmm, if i remeber it
15,01correct, then we played "who has the biggest c*ck", and as usual it was Cake who

15,01had taken the victory.

15,01Even though Flower came in third (out of three ofcourse) he won our other belly-

15,01button competition (yes, we were bored that evening). This competition was
15,01Flowers favourit - we call it "rear-racer" (he sat on the toilet for 2 hours in
15,01a row, while screaming "i just want my dear Kultura, and everything will be ok".

15,01     Back on schedule. It was time for the ritual "dance-around", todays fool
15,01were, ofcourse, Garflozzy, who ended up 4th in all competitions (eventhough
15,01only three attended!). Maybe it is time for you to move on, "no hints, man,
15,01but you just can't cope up with us anymore" Cake said in the telephone to Gar-
15,01flozzy, "maybe you should come through with your true color, and go with the
15,01rest to #remorse?" Cake continued.
15,01      "Yo mang, were's my bird when i need her?" it came from the toilet, where
15,01Flower was playing his bag-pibe. "Errr, shut up mahn!" Spice1 said angrily,
15,01since he had no party-girls this evening. "I wanna go to tha town mahn, anyone
15,01with me?" Spice1 shouted, <arghumpf> it came again from the toilet, "count me
15,01in" Flower groaned. "Arh, shit now i HAVE to go with you" Cake said disapointed.
