15,01"Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the ship,
15,01Not a circuit was buzzing, not one microchip.
15,01THe phasers were hung in the armory securely,
15,01In the hope that no alien would get up that early.
15,01The crewmen were nestled all snug in their bunks,
15,01(Except for the few that were partying drunks);
15,01And Picard in his nightshirt, and Bev in her lace,
15,01Had just settled down, for a neat face-to-face.
15,01When out in the hall, there arose such a racket,
15,01That we leapt from our beds, pulling on pant and jacket.
15,01Away to the lift we all shot like a gun,
15,01Jumped into the cars and shouted, "Deck One!"
15,01The bridge red alert lights that flashed through the din,
15,01Gave the lustre of Hades, to objects within,
15,01When what on the viewscreen our eyes did behold,
15,01But a strange kind of sleigh and some guy who looked old.
15,01But the glint in his eyes was so strange and askew,
15,01We knew in a moment, it had to be Q.
15,01His sleigh grew much larger, as closer it came,
15,01Then he zapped on the bridge and addressed us by name.
15,01"It's Riker! It's Data! It's Worf and Jean-Luc!
15,01It's Geordi and Wesley, the genetic fluke!
15,01To the top of the bridge, to the top of the hall!
15,01Now float away! Float away! Float away all!"
15,01As the leaves in the autumn are whisked off the street,
15,01So the floor of the bridge came away from our feet.
15,01And up to the ceiling our bodies they flew,
15,01As the Captain cried out, "What the HELL is this, Q?!!"
15,01The prankster just laughed and expanded his grin,
15,01And snapping his fingers, he vanished again.
15,01As we took in our plight and were looking around,
15,01The spell was removed, and we crashed to the ground.
15,01Then Q dressed in fur from his head to his toe,
15,01Appeared once again to continue the show.
15,01"That's enough," cried the Captain, "You'll stop this at once!"
15,01"Worf," said Riker. "Take aim at this dunce!"
15,01"I'm deeply offended, Jean-Luc," replied Q
15,01"I just wanted to celebrate Christmas with you."
15,01As we scoffed at his words, he produced a large sack,
15,01He dumped out the contents and took a step back.
15,01"I've brought gifts," he said. "Just to prove I'm sincere,
15,01There's something delightful for everyone here."
15,01He sat on the floor and dug into his pile,
15,01And handed out presents with his most charming smile.
15,01"For Counsellor Troi, there's no need to explain,
15,01Here's Tylenol-Beta for all of your pain.
15,01For Worf I've some mints as his breath's not too great,
15,01And for Geordi LaForge, an inflatable date.
15,01For Wesley some hormones and Clearasil-Plus,
15,01For Data a joke book, for Riker a truss.
15,01For Beverly Crusher there's sleek lingerie,
15,01And for Jean-Luc, the thrill of seeing her that way."
15,01He sprang to his feet with that grin on his face,
15,01And clapping his hands, diappeared into space.
15,01But we heard him exclaim as he dwindled from sight:
15,01"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good flight!"
