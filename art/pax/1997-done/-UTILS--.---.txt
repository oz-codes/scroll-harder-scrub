15,01 A penguin was driving through the desert when his car broke down.  He
15,01waddled to the nearest phone to call AAA.  His car was quickly towed to the
15,01nearest garage where the mechanic told him he would need a couple of hours to
15,01check out the car.  The penguin, being a good natured bird, didn't complain
15,01but wondered off to find the closest supermarket.

15,01   He proceeded to the frozen foods section and hung out near the fish
15,01sticks.  After an hour he got in the freezer next to the vanilla ice cream
15,01and ate several gallons.  Then he saw the time and went back to the garage
15,01covered in ice cream.  The mechanic walked over to him wiping his hands and
15,01shaking his head saying, "It looks like you blew a seal."  Blushing, the
15,01penguin said, "Oh no! It's just ice cream."
