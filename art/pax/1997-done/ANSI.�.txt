15,01                 Diary of an AOL User.

15,01July 18 - I just tried to connect to America Online. I've heard it is
15,01the best online service I can get.  They even included a free disk!  I'd
15,01better hold onto it incase they don't ever send me anther one!  I
15,01can't connect. I don't know what is wrong.

15,01July 19 - Some guy at the tech support center says my computer needs a
15,01modem. I don't see why. He's just trying to cheat me. How dumb does he
15,01think I am?

15,01July 22 - I bought the modem. I couldn't figure out where it goes. It
15,01wouldn't fit in the monitor or the printer. I'm confused.

15,01July 23 - I finally got the modem in and hooked up. that nine year old
15,01next door did it for me. But it still don't work. I cant get online.

15,01July 25 - That nine year old kid next door hooked me up to America
15,01Online for me. He's so smart. I told the kid he was a prodigy.  But he
15,01says that's just another service. What a modest kid.  He's so smart and
15,01he does these services for people.  Anyway he's smarter then the jerks
15,01who sold me the modem. They didn't even tell me about communications
15,01software. Bet they didn't know. And why do they put two telephone jack
15,01holes in the back of a modem when you only need one?  And why do they
15,01have one labeled phone when you are not suppose to hook it to the phone
15,01jack on the wall?  I thought the dial tone sounded funny! Boy, are modem
15,01makers dumb!  But the kid figured it out by the sound.

15,01July 26 - What's the internet?  I thought I was on America Online. Not
15,01this internet thing. I'm confused.

15,01July 27 - The nine year old kid next door showed me how to use this
15,01America Online stuff. I told him he must be a genius. He says that he is
15,01compared to me.  Maybe he's not so modest after all.

15,01July 28 - I tried to use chat today.  I tried to talk into my computer
15,01but nothing happened. maybe I need to buy a microphone.

15,01July 29 - I found this thing called usenet. I got out of it because I'm
15,01connected to America Online not usenet.

15,01July 30 - These people in this usenet thing keep using capital letters. 
15,01How do they do that?  I never figured out how to type capital letters.
15,01Maybe they have a different type of keyboard.

15,01JULY 31 -  I CALLED THE COMPUTER MAKER I BOUGHT IT FROM TO COMPLAIN
15,01ABOUT NOT HAVING A CAPITOL LETTER KEY. THE TECH SUPPORT GUY SAID IT WAS
15,01THIS CAPS LOCK KEY.  WHY DIDN'T THEY SPELL IT OUT? I TOLD HIM I GOT A
15,01CHEAP KEYBOARD AND WANTED A BETTER ONE. AND ONE OF MY SHIFT KEYS ISNT
15,01THE SAME SIZE AS THE OTHER. HE SAID THATS A STANDARD. I TOLD HIM I
15,01DIDN'T WANT A STANDARD KEYBOARD BUT ANOTHER BRAND. I MUST HAVE HAD AN
15,01IMPORTANT COMPLAINT BECAUSE I HEARD HIM TELL THE OTHER SUPPORT GUYS
15,01TO LISTEN IN ON OUR CONVERSATION.

15,01AUGUST 1 - I FOUND THIS THING CALLED THE USENET ORACLE. IT SAYS THAT IT
15,01CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I ASK IT. I SENT IT 44 SEPARATE QUESTIONS ABOUT
15,01THE INTERNET. I HOPE IT RESPONDS SOON.

15,01AUGUST 2 - I FOUND A GROUP CALLED REC.HUMOR. I DECIDED TO POST THIS JOKE
15,01ABOUT THE CHICKEN THAT CROSSED THE ROAD. TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE! HA!
15,01HA! I WASNT SURE I POSTED IT RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 56 MORE TIMES.

15,01AUGUST 3 - I KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE WORLD WIDE WEB. I DON'T NOW SPIDERS
15,01GREW THAT LARGE.

15,01AUGUST 4 - THE ORACLE RESPONDED TO MY QUESTIONS TODAY. GEEZ IT WAS RUDE.
15,01I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I POSTED AN ANGRY MESSAGE ABOUT IT TO
15,01REC.HUMOR.ORACLE. I WASNT SURE IF I POSTED RIGHT SO I POSTED IT 22 MORE
15,01TIMES.

15,01AUGUST 5 - SOMEONE TOLD ME TO READ THE FAQ. GEEZ THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO USE
15,01PROFANITY.

15,01AUGUST 6 - SOMEONE ELSE TOLD ME TO STOP SHOUTING IN ALL MY MESSAGES.
15,01WHAT A STUPID JERK. IM NOT SHOUTING! IM NOT EVEN TALKING! JUST TYPING!
15,01HOW CAN THEY LET THESE RUDE JERKS GO ON THE INTERNET?

15,01August 7 - Why have a Caps Lock key if you're not suppose to use it? Its
15,01probably an extra feature that costs more money.
