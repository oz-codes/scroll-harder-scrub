15,01        Today I sat upon the stony ground beneath a tall tree and watched  
15,01children play in the sun. Though they were unaware of me, I watched them
15,01climb and dance as I once did. I felt sorrow at what I had lost. The
15,01energy and imaginings of youth. The unbridled dance I had continually
15,01created from moment to moment.
15,01        As I watched and thought, an elderly couple appeared. I watched them
15,01walk close by me and saw that they had spent much time together. Perhaps
15,01thier whole lives. I thought upon my own life as it is and wondered if
15,01I would ever meet that woman for whom I was destined. Wondered if I 
15,01had been destined at all to do anything. I felt sorrow at what future I 
15,01could see, and in despair slept to run from the pain.
15,01        Once I opened my eyes again I found I had gone blind. The world
15,01was dark. Soon I discovered that the world had disappeared entirely. I
15,01couldn't stand, for there was no ground upon which to do so. I couldn't
15,01see for there was no light. No sound chose to echo in my ears, nor smell
15,01to tickle my nose. I felt nothing. There simply was nothing to feel.
15,01        As I floated in my new found freedom I let my thoughts wander
15,01over the life of despair I had left behind and smiled. I could never go 
15,01back now. Freedom from those chains of mortality was mine. The glue that 
15,01had stuck me to that body with it's inane desires had finally dissolved.
15,01        These thoughts of freedom were soon intruded upon by soft light.
15,01I couldn't know what to make of it. Something was coming for me. All
15,01I could feel now was fear. Something was coming to take me back to that
15,01horrible place where hunger was omnipotent and wisdom itself was nothing
15,01more than a misunderstood concept. `please, please leave me alone.' I
15,01begged of this new entity in my thoughts, `to you I owe nothing. Let
15,01me be.'
15,01        The voice that answered was no voice. There was no sound to 
15,01accompany the understood idea that had entered my head by itself.
15,01Confusion swept me as a man entered my view. This man was as wild
15,01as I'd ever seen. No clothing hung from his body, nor did any need to.
15,01It was plain that shame didn't exist here.
15,01        He motioned towards me and I was pulled forward with great speed,
15,01but there was no force to be felt. I flew past him, and all I could think
15,01was of an invitation that had come to me.
15,01        `Come', it said, `you are my guest. I have brought you here to
15,01meet someone'. I had no choice. My freedom had once again been stolen,
15,01but now there was no death to look forward to. I could only assume
15,01I had entered some afterlife never thought of on Earth. As I was pushed
15,01into the soft glow, I saw a figure. I couldn't see any kind of face. I
15,01could see where a face should be, but it change so swiftly. Now a young
15,01man, now an old woman, now a newborn child, now a dusty corpse. Nothing
15,01before or since this has inspired such fear, such agony of emotion.
15,01        The voice I felt from this entity (for I could still hear nothing,
15,01I could only feel ideas. I'm afraid I can't describe this well enough 
15,01to convey what it was I was going through) was a voice of compassion. A
15,01voice of complete understanding. It stated only what needed to be understood.
15,01nothing more, nothing less.
15,01        `Come', I felt, and followed willingly. My fear being replaced
15,01by wonder.
15,01        The soft glow I had earlier seen was emanating from a beautiful
15,01web of light. Strands of looping interwoven light that held me entranced.
15,01        My power to describe the things that follow is weak. Please try
15,01to understand that I cannot do this vision justice no matter how I try.
15,01        The being I was now following seemed to be in some control of
15,01this tapestry of light. (Nothing was pulling me now and I found I could
15,01move at will; These are the things I observed.) This being could move
15,01faster than I could possibly have imagined before now. First an old woman
15,01gently nudging a strand into place. Then a young boy tugging violently
15,01at another, trying to change its course. 
15,01        Soon the being came to me. It motioned that I follow, and follow
15,01I did. The things I saw as we flew through the strands fixed my attention
15,01as never before. We whipped through light that was flailing, trying to hold
15,01our course. We followed strands that seemed not to move at all, and I
15,01basked in thier glow. The being seemed to move as if it had done this a 
15,01thousand times before. Never seming to slow or correct its movement as
15,01it led me through the multitude of living, glowing ropes.
15,01        We soon settled near one strand. In one direction, off to the right,
15,01This light didn't move at all. In the other direction, it moved. Only
15,01a little where we were, but farther away it looked like a dervish straining
15,01to escape a binding trap. To be struck by it would mean my total destruction.
15,01So I was inclined to think at the time.
15,01        The being settled across the strand from me and spread its ever 
15,01changing arms. `You', I felt. That was all for a short time. I couldn't
15,01hope to understand what it meant, but it didn't answer right away. I
15,01thought quickly about what it could mean, but was as confused as the 
15,01moment I first had entered this place of light.
15,01        The being then dropped one hand. The one pointing towards the 
15,01twisting and flighty end of the strand. `past', I felt, and a glimmer
15,01of understanding brushed my mind. It raised its hand again, simultaneously
