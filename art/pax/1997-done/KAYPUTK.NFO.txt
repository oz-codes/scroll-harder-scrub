15,01All files in this pack were created before March 10th, 1997 by Kayputk.
15,01Most of the graphics in this artpack were created using Persistance Of Vision
15,01(better known as POV), and Moray--Why do I tell you this? Because I get daily
15,01e-mails asking what I use to make my graphics.

15,01What versions I use:
15,01        POV 3.1
15,01        Moray 2

15,01Since this is my first artpack, I am releasing stuff from as far back as
15,01late December of 1996.

15,01I am currently available for creating graphics for you (AKA unemployed), if
15,01you want to pay me.  If I have the free time, I may also do free work with
15,01exposure as payment (notice di.jpg and iti.jpg).

15,01My web site:                                      | It's purpose:

15,01but that's for another pack.
