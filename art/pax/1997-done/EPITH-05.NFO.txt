15,01General Information :
15,01=======================

15,01*** MAKE SURE TO VIEW THIS DEMO WITH SOUND! ***

15,01This demo NEEDS the sound to play, otherwise the cool effects won't run!
15,01It's synchronized to the music.  Without music, it'll still look cool, but
15,01remember -- you're missing out!  Read the next section for info on getting
15,01the sound to run.


15,01Problems / Fixes / Answered Questions :
15,01=========================================

15,01The main problem will be the .MOD not playing or not loading.  There are
15,01(as always) several reasons for this:

15,01     # Not enough free conventional memory available
15,01       + You must have at least 600k free base RAM (it may work with
15,01         about 580k, but if you don't have too much free, that's your
15,01         problem.)

15,01     # You're running Windows95 and it's done something silly
15,01       + I won't be the first one when I say that Windows95 does some
15,01         really stupid things while trying to emmulate DOS.  If the MOD
15,01         doesn't play, quit your DOS window, open a new one and try
15,01         to run it again.  If that doesn't work, reboot in DOS.

15,01     # Incompatible Memory Managers
15,01       + Often called IMM's, these wonderful programs sit in memory and
15,01         try to move pieces of RAM around while the program is running.
15,01         Now, I have no idea how the .MOD player works -- there's no
15,01         source -- but I'm certain that EMM386 and possibly QEMM will
15,01         mess it up.  If it doesn't run, that might be your problem.

15,01     # Fate has it in for you
15,01       + The bhuddists believe in fate, or a pre-determined path in life.
15,01         If the universe has it in for you, there's no way you're going
15,01         to be able to run this demo.  Tough luck!


15,01History :
15,01===========

15,01Okay, well, the thing was coded badly -- I admit that.  It's not really the
15,01code, but the compiler and the MOD player that make it horrible. It was done
15,01using Turbo C++ and a really crappy MOD library, all for real mode.  I
15,01wanted to rewrite it for Watcom C++, but there's so many things I'd have to
15,01redo that it wouldn't be worth it.

15,01This thing was finished in June, and wasn't released until September because
15,01of a bunch of weird stuff.  It would've come out in the July pack, but that
15,01wasn't released.  I held out in August because I wanted to re-code it in
15,01Watcom C++ to make it faster, but didn't.  Now, here it is, finally.

15,01ENJOY!
