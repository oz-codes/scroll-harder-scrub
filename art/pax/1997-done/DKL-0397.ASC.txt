15,01Hi there, everyone, and welcome to my XXXth month in Bamboosh. I haven't been
15,01with the group from the beginning, but I'm certainly one of the seniors in
15,01Bamboosh. This month has been boring when it comes to ascii. I'm not really
15,01that much into drawing newschool anymore, as I should be, but I hope the
15,01inspiration will return to me soon. Atleast I did a few ansis, not usual for
15,01being me. Also check them out. I'm not one of the guys who likes to give long
15,01personal greets (like Pyx :), so I'll just go through all my pals in the 
15,01scene: Senile, Pyx (ofcourse), Intellius, Tektronix, Vermin, Joda, Rex,
15,01       Ize, Prodigy, Phlare, Outraider, Kelthar, Dfuck :), Outraider,
15,01       Noah, Rexazy, Slash, Groove, Prodigy, Discofunk, Vader, 
15,01       Mr4tune, Bizar, Hybris, Grimmy, Draven, Wave, Avenger, Toot...
15,01       Hope I didn't forget anyone, if I did, excuse me, I've been
15,01       writing Bamboosh info-files for hours and I'm kind of tired.
15,01Note: I do not do ascii requests anymore, trades are always welcome though.

15,01wow, look at those eleet + amiga-colly separators. top of darklordinality, i
15,01actually did this logo in one day, and it wasn't requested. maybe i should
15,01start doing my requests instead of giving away these free logos? nah, too much
15,01work. enjoy rexazy, this is one of my better logos lately. have fun.
