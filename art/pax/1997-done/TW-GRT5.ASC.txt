14,01.15.00. 14Yeah, yeah I know no new greets header :). Anyways I don't have any
14,01    greets this month so I'll use the space I have to let everyone know
14,01    what I have planed. As I'm sure you all know that I'm the new lit
14,01    coordinator. I have big plans to change the way lit is presented
14,01    each month. I will be doing this via the Internet making a new site
14,01    called "FLiP's Monthly Literature Showcase". There you will be able
14,01    to read all the literature that has been submitted each month. You
14,01    will also be able to read the old literature and learn more about
14,01    the authors. So I will be contacting all writers in FLiP to request
14,01    for some information. To make things easyer please contact me
14,01    A.S.A.P. via e-mail at thewarden@geocities.com or as a last
14,01    resort at thepenn@hotmail.com, FidoNet 1:140/150.8, or FireNet
14,01    603:1/1. I have other ideas for FLiP in general, such as a t-shirt,
14,01    put more information on the web about the members, monthly/weekly
14,01    contests, etc. but I'll go into further details at a later date. We
14,01    finished 1996 with a bang so why not start the new year with a
14,01    bang!
