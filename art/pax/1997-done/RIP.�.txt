15,01 DISORDER IN THE COURT:
15,01                A COLLECTION OF 'TRANSQUIPS'
15,01by Richard Lederer

15,01Most language is spoken language, and most words, once they are
15,01uttered, vanish forever into the air. But such is not the case with
15,01language spoken during courtroom trials, for there exists an army of
15,01courtroom reporters whose job it is to take down and preserve every
15,01statement made during the proceedings.

15,01Mary Louise Gilman, the venerable editor of the National Shorthand
15,01Reporter has collected many of the more hilarious courtroom bloopers
15,01in two books Humor in the Court (1977) and More Humor in the Court,
15,01published a few months ago. From Mrs. Gilman's two volumes, here are
15,01some of my favorite transquips, all recorded by America's keepers of
15,01the word:
