15,01Kyoto Girlwatching

15,01Identical legs under pink flaps,
15,01water splashes sunbleached socks.
15,01Umbrellas like the tops of fungi
15,01grown in the basements of discotheques
15,01hide the top halves of teapot princesses.

15,01In groups of three or four,
15,01synchronised like dancers,
15,01a promenade is held,
15,01a procession of bumbling beauties.
15,01Charms and incantations held aloft,
15,01lucky spirit animals woven into hair,
15,01the afternoon goes off without a hitch.

15,01Only once saw I two legs planted spare
15,01in a field of unfriendly space:
15,01a girl alone, unsure which way was north,
15,01unsure, perhaps, of how to use her feet
15,01unattended.
15,01Crosswalks blinking helplessly,
15,01blind to the fears of a bird
15,01born without a mother,
15,01a mouthless, paper
15,01emperor's daughter
15,01caught in a neon trap.
