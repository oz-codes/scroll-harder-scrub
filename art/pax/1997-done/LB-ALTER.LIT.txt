15,01               ~Altered Dreams~ 

15,01          In the midst of a lush, fertile valley
15,01               she found herself, it seems 
15,01          Living out what were no longer
15,01               only empty, elusive dreams 
15,01          Expressing her every notion 
15,01               her imagination wild and free 
15,01          Baring her soul, her heart and her thoughts 
15,01               unafraid of what others might see 
15,01          Content with the course set before her 
15,01               cherishing each step that she's made 
15,01          Holding her memories to her 
15,01               her doubts, her fears all allayed 
15,01          But time changes all that's before us 
15,01                with each day comes a new path to explore
15,01          And, try as we may, we can never
15,01               stop the hands of time as they soar 
15,01          As much as she'd like to cling onto 
15,01               the present and all of its schemes 
15,01          She must consign them all to sweet memories
15,01               and proceed with her own altered dreams
