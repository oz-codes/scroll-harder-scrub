15,01         hi. my name is son of sam. I decided to give ascii a try.
15,01         the main reason why I wanna draw ascii is to get a local
15,01         board up real soon, 'cause I miss local boards, and well,
15,01         we've never had an ascii board in these parts (central
15,01         819) and I thought it'd be cool to have something different
15,01         for once, and something that doesn't take forever to display.
15,01         of course, my style sucks, and I'm gonna experiment a little,
15,01         prolly in oldschool, 'cause I want my board to be portable,
15,01         so I don't wanna use hi-ascii (just a momentary thought, not
15,01         an all-life politic). what I like about ascci is that even a
15,01         lazy fuck like me can experiment, and you can experiemnt a
15,01         lot on each logo. something else I wanna try is using old
15,01         graphism techniques with ascii, not just the new "hip" art
15,01         of the streets. imagine a logo inspired by the pre-war german
15,01         school ;).

15,01                                        - son.
