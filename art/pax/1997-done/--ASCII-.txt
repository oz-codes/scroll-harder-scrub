15,01>Sergeant Mack had a fine time during his stay in Hong Kong, but paid for it
15,01>when he came down with a strange oriental venereal disease. So he made the
15,01>rounds of every American doctor in the community. To his horror he
15,01>discovered  that not only were they unable to cure him, they all informed
15,01>him that the only  course of treatment was to have his penis amputated.
15,01>
15,01>Desperate, Sergeant Mack made an appointment with a leading Chinese doctor,
15,01>figuring that he might know more about an eastern malady. "So you, Doctor
15,01>Cheung, think I need to have my dick amputated?" he asked anxiously.
15,01>
15,01>"No, no, no," replied the Chinese doctor testily.
15,01>
15,01>A huge smile broke out over the serviceman's face. "Boy, that's great, Doc.
15,01>Every one of those American medics said they'd have to cut it off."
15,01>
15,01>"Those Western doctors--all they ever want to do is cut, cut, cut," explained
15,01>Dr Cheung exasperatedly. "You just wait two weeks. Penis fall off all by
15,01>itself."
