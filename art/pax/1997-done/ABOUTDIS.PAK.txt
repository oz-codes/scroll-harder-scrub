15,01- whelp we have barley squeaked out our 3rd pack
15,01the quality isnt up to par, but we have some good
15,01ones in here.

15,01- as for overdose we are in desperate need of new
15,01talents, our current members are dwindling, except
15,01for a small group of about 10 or so dedicated
15,01members. the others are very un-frequent visitors

15,01- also in the last month we have lost our bots,
15,01so if someone out the has a bot that we could
15,01borrow it would be greatly appriciated in #overdose

15,01- on the brighter side, we have just picked up a
15,01t1 www/ftp/shell server with 10 gigs of room for
15,01our exclusive use, it is in the midst of being
15,01fully operational as we speak. hopefully we will
15,01bring in some perspective new people w/ this.

15,01- we have also lost our president, so we will be
15,01reconstructing the heirarchy in overdose, yay fun,
15,01so we have a new pres. in the near future.

15,01- whelp, that wraps up everything that has happend in
15,01the last month. its been hectic, hopefully we will still
15,01be around for next month.

15,01I'd like to thank right now these people :
15,01Tek, Hex, Tarmac, Frodo<whoever u are>, hobbe, merchant, and purple..

15,01these are the most helpful, and best crew a group could ask for...

15,01lata all.. see ya next pak
