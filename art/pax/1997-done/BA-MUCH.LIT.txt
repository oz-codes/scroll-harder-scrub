15,01    i read, once, about a falling god,
15,01  but he was doubly removed from truth,
15,01               as a dream
15,01                          in a book.
15,01        let me join you in the fed fire,
15,01                   tumbling through your native air,
15,01            describing the same pattern as your fall through time.
15,01    but i am tired of holding your hand -
15,01               though i fear that i will defy physics and fall faster
15,01        if i perform the ceremony of release.

15,01 fear kept me once, old love.
15,01    songs of fear, and your apocalyptic silhouette
15,01                               against something i can edit memory to name
15,01                            orion.

15,01           however, as i do recall (correctly, in hope)
15,01     that the god was not a god, but a would-be..
15,01                  an upstart of mythology
15,01         whose name is still in argument.

15,01                          fall with me, god of hallucination,
15,01               and if you are unreal, i can make you symbolise anything,
15,01      patron, patriarch, lord of all unevenness..
15,01       
15,01                       make him love

15,01          epistemology injected into me,
15,01                    the father and the plague
15,01               but the vaccinations and sensibility
15,01            and through it all, i continue to doubt myself.
15,01                            and you.

15,01    i'm so certain you will leave like the others,
15,01                  self-fulfilling prophecy..
15,01        so go, then, when vows no longer mean concepts.
15,01                           tears are not for effect     
15,01                      but in mourning of what i can see coming
15,01            can't stop             anything
15,01                   i grow weary, and love denies love,
15,01               in outright defiance of faith.
