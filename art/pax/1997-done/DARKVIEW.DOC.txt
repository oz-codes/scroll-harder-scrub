15,01Here is yet another version of DarkView..I heard a lot of complaints about the
15,01new VESA routines for DarkView 3.1 which was released in Feb. 1995. I am
15,01currently working on solving the problem. Thanks for all the feedback. There
15,01have been a couple of minor changes in DarkView. I increased the speed of the
15,01ANSI routines by a factor of 125%. Not bad eh!? A brief overview of the changes
15,01is provided below:

15,01 Switch Modes while viewing ANSi forward/backward using Right/Left Arrow keys
15,01 Increased speed of ANSI routines
15,01 Increased speed of VGA 320x200x256 ANSI viewing routines
15,01 PGUP/PGDN bugs in the text interface have been fixed.
15,01 Some VESA routines have been reconstructed.
15,01 Some other minor bugs.

15,01If the VESA routines do not work on your video card then try UNIVESA.EXE.
15,01It might fix the problem. Until next time...(be young, have fun, join dark)

15,01- VGA/Text Interface -

15,01  Well as far as I know this is the first Viewer with a VGA interface.
15,01I thought of the idea and decided to work on it, and as time passed, I got
15,01comfortable with it. So here is something new which other viewers do not have.
15,01I plan to make the Interface faster in the next version. The interface can
15,01support 3000+ files, depending on memory. The VGA interface is the default
