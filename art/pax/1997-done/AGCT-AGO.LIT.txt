15,01 Bloated Hello

15,01"the rest are slugs. hello."
15,01- written on loose-leaf paper
15,01folded in my back pocket
15,01deeply creased from sitting

15,01got it memorized -
15,01"the rest are slugs. hello."
15,01but i haven't moved
15,01much since writing it,

15,01watching her hair
15,01go by        no name, no person;
15,01red leaves dangling down her neck
15,01look like lunch.

15,01   I can hear them gliding
15,01   eye-stalks sliding in and out
15,01   greeting me.  my paper warned me
15,01   but I am not ready for this.

15,01   She picks one up, holds it in her hand.
15,01   "Hello."  It doesn't answer.
15,01   I turn the paper upside-down,
15,01   hoping that I misread it.
