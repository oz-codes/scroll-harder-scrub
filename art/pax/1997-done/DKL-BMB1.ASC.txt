15,01i tried to make a cheap ami/x small-scale style rippoff, but it didn't turn
15,01out very good, sorry about that. i just made it for fun anyways. 

15,01well, i'm kind of tired of doing ascii right now, much more fun to be an irc-
15,01looser, but the inspiration will come back soon i hope. it's just another un-
15,01inspired period + that i have shitloads of work to do at school. the work this
15,01month is not very good, but there's something i like about the bmb newschool
15,01atleast. i'll be back someday, COUNT ON THAT MOTHERFUCKAZ! errh.. i'm quite
15,01scary. anyway, check out the new odelay group's next pack, i don't know what
15,01the group name will be or when the pack's going to be released, but it will
15,01sometime. also look out for snOt, because our pack is gonna be leet. i could
15,01have greeted everyone i knew, but that would take far too much time. so -
15,01greets to anyone i know, keep it real.. and buy the sublime cd, they rule!
15,01thanks and goodbye.
