15,01I: The Macroscopic Perspective.

15,01You underestimate
15,01-- both of you.
15,01Preppy / grunge,
15,01and I lie somewhere in between,
15,01in the vast gray of poseurs,
15,01lit intermittently by true individuals
15,01(true paradoxie)
15,01-- this gray, this limbo.
15,01My state before conception,
15,01my state after the grubs descend.

15,01Give me a bottle of Coco's sweet-smelling alcohol
15,01(chanelnumberfive-numberfive!),
15,01and I shall smash it in a bum's lair.
15,01(whispered:) "I look at you, and I see myself. Obsession."
15,01The Julliard-cum-Harvard genius COOs of the
15,01parfum producers
15,01congratulate themselves, and
15,01leave for home on the arm of an icy blonde
15,01(last seen perusing Dostoevsky at ten pages per minute).

15,01My face shines with the arrogance of helplessness;
15,01my whole existence is flawed.
