15,01        The most beautiful day

15,01I sometimes wonder if I deserve you,
15,01You whose radiance fills my day with joy.
15,01Whose heart has shown me to love again,
15,01And whose love is the reason of my existence

15,01Often I think about my life,
15,01And the many roads I have traveled.
15,01Only to miss that very door,
15,01That leads home to you

15,01I have never told you my love,
15,01Of the most beautiful day in my life.
15,01It's the day you took in your hands my heart,
15,01And with tears agreed to be my wife.
