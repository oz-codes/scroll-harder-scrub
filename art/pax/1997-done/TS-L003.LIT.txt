15,01        Apart

15,01How did we get this far apart,
15,01I thought this love of ours is forever.
15,01How will I live another day,
15,01Without you by my side.

15,01How did we ever get to this,
15,01A wall separates us.
15,01Words cannot even begin,
15,01To describe how much I missed you

15,01I want so much to understand,
15,01Why you feel this way
15,01Yet I am lost to your responses,
15,01And your thoughtless words

15,01Before you walk out my door,
15,01Remember that even if you forget me
15,01You had everything I ever had to give,
15,01You had my love.
