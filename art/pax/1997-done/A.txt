15,01Thirty Ways To Confuse Santa Claus
15,01Our thanks to Rob M for these words of "advice."

15,011. Instead of milk and cookies, leave him a salad, and a note explaining
15,01that you think he could stand to lose a few pounds.

15,012. While he's in the house, go find his sleigh and write him a speeding ticket.

15,01 3. Leave him a note, explaining that you've gone away for the holidays.
15,01Ask if he would mind watering your plants.

15,01 4. While he's in the house, replace all his reindeer with exact replicas.
15,01Then wait and see what happens when he tries to get them to fly.

15,01 5. Keep an angry bull in your living room. If you think a bull goes crazy
15,01when he sees a little red cape, wait until he sees that big, red Santa
15,01suit!

15,016. Build an army of mean-looking snowmen on the roof, holding signs that
15,01say "We hate Christmas," and "Go away Santa."

15,01 7. Leave a note by the telephone, telling Santa that Mrs. Claus called and
15,01wanted to remind him to pick up some milk and a loaf of bread on his way
15,01home.

15,018. Throw a surprise party for Santa when he comes down the chimney. Refuse
15,01to let him leave until the strippers arrive.

15,019. While he's in the house, find the sleigh and sit in it. As soon as he
15,01comes back and sees you, tell him that he shouldn't have missed that last
15,01payment and take off.

15,0110. Leave a plate filled with cookies and a glass of milk out, with a note
15,01that says, "For The Tooth Fairy." Leave another plate out with half a stale
15,01cookie and a few drops of skim milk in a dirty glass with a note that says,
15,01"For Santa."

15,0111. Take everything out of your house as if it's just been robbed. When
15,01Santa arrives, show up dressed like a policeman and say, "Well, well. They
15,01always return to the scene of the crime."

15,0112. Leave out a copy of your Christmas list with last-minute changes and
15,01corrections.

15,0113. While he's in the house, cover the top of the chimney with barbed wire.

15,0114. Leave lots of hunting trophies and guns out where Santa's sure to see
15,01them. Go outside, yell, "Ooh! Look! A deer! And he's got a red nose!" and
15,01fire a gun.

15,0115. Leave Santa a note, explaining that you've moved. Include a map with
15,01unclear and hard-to-read directions to your new house.

15,0116. Set a bear trap at the bottom of the chimney. Wait for Santa to get
15,01caught in it, and then explain that you're sorry, but from a distance, he
15,01looked like a bear.

15,0117. Leave out a Santa suit, with a dry-cleaning bill.

15,0118. Paint "hoof-prints" all over your face and clothes. While he's in the
15,01house, go out on the roof. When he comes back up, act like you've been
15,01"trampled." Threaten to sue.

15,0119. Instead of ornaments, decorate your tree with Easter eggs.

15,0120. Cut a big hole in your roof and cover it with a blanket, so that when
15,01Santa tries to land on your roof his sleigh crashes into your living room.
15,01Explain that you've been having problems with termites.

15,0121. Set up your living room to look like a workshop, and have people
15,01dressed up like elves making toys. When Santa comes, sneer and say, "What's
15,01the matter? Afraid of a little competition?"

15,0122. While he's on the roof, yell up to Santa, asking if he'll mind
15,01adjusting your TV antenna. When he does so, tell him, "That's good" and
15,01don't let him move until the "commercial" comes on.

15,0123. Put on a giant tree costume, and wear a sign that says, "Man-eating
15,01Tree-Stay Back." When Santa comes, wave your arms angrily and chase him
15,01back up the chimney.
