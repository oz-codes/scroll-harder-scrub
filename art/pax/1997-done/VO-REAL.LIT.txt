15,01Christmas Reality

15,01The air chewed me up
15,01before it shoved me through the door
15,01but I would not have minded
15,01the mastication
15,01if you would have been visiting me
15,01this Christmas night.
15,01Marketing this holiday
15,01calls for unrealistic, dreamy
15,01scenes
15,01and I have conjured
15,01a painting
15,01of you accepting sleep's invitation
15,01as my fingers swim lazily in your hair;
15,01your head resting on my lap.
15,01But the real Christmas is never magical
15,01just as my house is empty of you.
15,01I step outside
15,01for the cold to swallow
15,01me into the night.
