15,01can I do this thing
15,01put words to page and wax poetic
15,01of loves lost and dreams dared
15,01or have these simple things passed me by

15,01I could once fill volumes with my peculularity
15,01extoll the virtues of my vices for all to witness
15,01and with such semblance even I benefitted from the deed
15,01now I feel as a child to a new world
15,01I must test the water before plunging in to the depths
15,01too afraid to drown my soul in love too deep
15,01that I may never swim again

15,01be this fear of loving, or being loved, I cannot decipher
15,01it follows as a shadow the length of my days
15,01relenting only in the night, where I am free
15,01but even this freedom is an illusion
15,01the dawn always comes again to find me dreading another day

15,01I fear the encroaching bitterness
15,01sweeping in to my soul, enshrouding all my other facilities
15,01I was once so capable in these matters
15,01excreting my darkness as a method for these wounds to heal
15,01leaving only scars of battle on which I might retell my tales
15,01but now the retelling strikes me with distaste
15,01I wish I could but wash the blood from my hands
15,01and never remember any of it again

15,01I am cursed with a memory unfading
15,01in the abscence of clouds I contemplate
15,01these lost talents of mine
15,01and try to remember what it was to write
