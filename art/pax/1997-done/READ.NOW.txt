15,01                                         Mod by: Cygnus [iNF]

15,01        Ok.. This is my first mod for iNF and probly my simplest... Ok..
15,01it is very easy to work with.. All ya gotta know is a little bit about 
15,01MCI kodes and Menu editing.. Any fool know's a thing or to about that.. 
15,01ok.. Its simple.. For you brain dead slackers I will write it step by 
15,01step for ya.. 

15,011. First unzip the MISC.ZIP into yer Misc dir (duh)
15,012. Then unzip the MENU.ZIP into yer Menu dir
15,013. View the ANSi's and Menu files and edit them to your needs..
15,01        (Make sure to keep my name in the credits.. or I will 
15,01         hunt you down and kill you... )

15,01        <editors note- We here at infectious love to hunt down and ritually
15,01        beat people. Just ask diamond.>

15,014. Edit the Helpfile.. And you should be off to go.. Very simple.. If you
15,01still cant get it, sell your computer. You're probably not bright enough to
15,01be running one anyways.
