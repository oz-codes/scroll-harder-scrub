15,01 

15,01       It's dark, gloomy, unconsious, yet we move on, guided only
15,01        by our lights along a path chosen for us.  Shapes slowly
15,01        form as the wise man can be seen over the tree tops.  He
15,01        casts his golden spell upon our land, bekenning us to rise
15,01        from our beds.
15,01 
15,01        We continue to travel endlessly like a flowing river. 
15,01        Visions of the past rest in our minds as the golden spell
15,01        distorts the shapes around us.
15,01 
15,01        We are helplessly trapped by the biological barrier of time. 
15,01        We connot escape it, whether in haste or eternity it is always
15,01        constant.  Money, power, human desires play no part.  Our lives
15,01        continue in costant motion.
15,01 
15,01        The sun, earth and moon are recycled through the generations of
15,01        time.  The dead are forgotten by them and the children crattled
15,01        They stand alone and survive the lonely cycles of the hour glass. 
15,01        Hunger, desire for more of it, all life craves it. We are puppets
15,01        of it's game, playing the pawns of emotion. We are lost one by one
15,01        in the flowing rapids of time. 
15,01
