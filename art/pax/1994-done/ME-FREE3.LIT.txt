15,01Freedom III

15,01                "Optima dies... prima fugit"
15,01                                - Virgil


15,01Travelers on the rails,
15,01We pass though life...
15,01Almost oblivious to every small victory,
15,01To every tiny gain we achieve...
15,01Our eyes condescend-

15,01To be like the birds,
15,01Who fly above our dying bodies,
15,01Is what I wish to achieve,
15,01But yet even they...
15,01        Are not free-

15,01No, the word freedom has no
15,01  revelance for today,
15,01Every traveler steps onto the
15,01  train of his destiny,
15,01And is swept away to distant points
15,01  of the galaxy...
15,01Above us they shine like stars,
15,01Unmoving apexes,
15,01Looking out from slavery-

15,01The most noble fall...
15,01And maybe in falling they learn 
15,01Those great, and small mysteries...
15,01Of living, and dying and
15,01Where the birds go in the winter, 
15,01But what have we to look foward to
15,01If every century ties us down to convention,
15,01Trival ways...
15,01And the utter lost of our individuality?
15,01Freedom!-
