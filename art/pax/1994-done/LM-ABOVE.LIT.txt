00,01He Above

00,01Shiftless, lying undaunted
00,01waiting for his prey
00,01The serenity of it all
00,01is what guides him through the day
00,01He sparks his flame
00,01hiding his grotesqueness from the light
00,01mutilated by the system
00,01what a horrid sight
00,01Struggling for control
00,01He gropes for a sense of reality
00,01making no sense what-so-ever
00,01his life is a mere parody
00,01Everyone's an opponent
00,01in this wicked game
00,01but he above, above the rest
00,01Leper Messiah is his name
