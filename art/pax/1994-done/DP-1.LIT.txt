15,01Anger...
15,01Rage...
15,01Frustration...
15,01Pursuit of a dream which will never come true
15,01A pointless quest yet I do not give up
15,01Keep trying...
15,01Keep going...
15,01Why do I bother?
15,01I know in my heart but not in my mind
15,01A continuing quest where misery is the outcome
15,01More pain
15,01More anger
15,01Keep trying...
15,01Keep going...
15,01I do not learn
15,01Persistence becomes futile
15,01The quest must end
15,01When?
15,01Where?
15,01You decide
15,01You control
15,01I bring pain on myself...
15,01But I know no other way
15,01An endless circle
15,01Walking around it through eternity
15,01Break the circle, set me free
15,01You won't...
15,01Desert me like you have so many others
15,01It matters not...
15,01When you come back I'll still be walking...trying
15,01Waiting...
15,01My patience wears thin...I grow tired
15,01Time for me to end this insanity
15,01I stop here, or do I start?
15,01Only time will tell
15,01Stepping outside the circle I see a new world
15,01Beauty, splendor...
15,01Without you it has no meaning
15,01Will it ever?

15,01Now you're stuck in the circle, waiting for me...
15,01I have the upper hand now but I will not help you.
15,01I won't set you free
15,01Feel what I have felt
15,01Dwell in pain, in misery
15,01Be what I once was...
15,01Alone...
15,01Confused...
15,01How does it feel?
15,01Stay there forever
15,01Become part of it
15,01You will never see me again
15,01I desert you as you did me
15,01Doomed forever to walk the circle of life

15,01I enjoy beauty now
15,01I become happy, content...
15,01Nothing will end this joy I feel now
15,01Freedom...
15,01Excitement...
15,01All of this, without you...
