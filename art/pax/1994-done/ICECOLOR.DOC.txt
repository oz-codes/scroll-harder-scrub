15,01                ICECOLOR v1.3 programmed by Leviathan of iCE

15,01General Description    
15,01-------------------
15,01    
15,01    iCECOLOR disables the blink on your monitor. What does this mean? This
15,01means that you get 16 colors in the background as well as 16 colors in the
15,01foreground. 

15,01How it works
15,01------------
15,01The attribute byte is set up like this :
15,01          
15,01          before :                  after :
15,01    |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|          |7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
15,01     | |   | |     |            |     | |     |
15,01     | +---+ +-----+            +-----+ +-----+
15,01     |   |      |                  |       |
15,01  blink back  foreground      background foreground

15,01Usesuly when you change video modes everything goes back to normal, but I've
15,01taken over interrupt 10H so it turns off the blink everytime you change modes

15,01Installation
15,01------------
15,01Put ICECOLOR.EXE and COLOR.COM in your path. Run program with ICECOLOR.EXE

15,01    WHATSNEW.TXT - Chages
15,01    TSR_LIB.ZIP  - File containing programming information
15,01       + TSR_LIB.C - C source for interphasing with ICECOLOR
15,01       + TSR_LIB.H - Header file w/ Assembly explanations
15,01       + EXAMPLE.C - Majority of source code to ICECOLOR.EXE

15,01Using ICECOLOR with The Draw
15,01----------------------------
15,01The draw has no idea that ICECOLOR is installed, so it still thinks it is 
15,01using the setup of : 8 background, 16 forefround, 16 blinking. You will 
15,01noctice that the blinking colors no longer blink, and their background is
15,01high intensity black. This is because black w/o blink = dark grey. so you
15,01select you colors as follows :
15,01    regular background colors work normaly :
15,01        0-7 for background and 0-15 for foreground
15,01    for high intensity background colors :
15,01        select from colors 16-31 to choose your foreground color, while 
15,01        telling the computer that you whant a high-intensity background
15,01        then choose colors 0-7 for you background color, but they will
15,01        now be high intensity
15,01problems w/ the draw :
15,01    When you are using high intensity colors and you use the delete key,
15,01    or clear the screen, it will use high intensity black for the background,
15,01    so make shure that you are in a normal background color when you delete
15,01    or clear the screen.

15,01Source code availibility
15,01------------------------
15,01The TSR section of ICECOLOR was written in 100% assembly, and the loader part 
15,01was written in C. If you would like the source, or have a question, try 
15,01to get in touch w/ me... somehow.
