14,01 W11e10l00come to KiMP.  Well, through the couple months we've taken to get our gr10o11u14p
14,01t11o10g00ether,  it looks like it  has finally payed off w/  our first pack.  We h10a11v14e
14,01o11u10r  00WHQ  [my board]  setup nicely,  and  KiMP has really  started to skyroc10k11e14t
14,01a11l10r00eady.  We will soon have 6-7 distros in Kentucky/Indiana.  They will also 11b14e
14,01l11i10n00ked to our net, KiMPNet. Call any of the KiMPNet sites you see in our mem10b11e14r
14,01l11i10s00t to chat on the KiMPNet. I guess the whole idea of KiMP is relaxed fun.  11W14e
14,01a11r10e 00laid back,  and produce whatever work we can.  We were a little pressed 10f11o14r
14,01d11e10a00dlines on  this pack,  but hey,  everything was just starting.  So give u10s 14a
14,01b11r10e00ak.  Luckily, nobody was grounded during this production,  nor did we hap10p11e14n
14,01t11o 00release a virus,  or sign any fake members to our group.   But hey,  I gu10e11s14s
15,01                         14y11o10u 00can say we just got luc10k11y14!

14,01 W11e10l00l, this pack was hell.  It was incredibly hard work.  KiMP started out w10i11t14h
14,01G11e10r00goff saying it'd  be pretty cool if we had an ansi  group, and myself say10i11n14g
14,01"11o10k00ay,  but if this group doesn't  produce ansi that  i can be proud  of and 11w14e
14,01b11e10c00ome just another one of those groups that everyone says `oh, they'll be d10o11n14e
14,01f11o10r 00in a few months,' then we will dissolve it."  well, i'm proud to say, i 10c11a14n
14,01b11e 00truly proud of the work we have put out.   It is not of ACiD quality, but 11i14t
14,01i11s 00what  can be expected of us.   I will tell you now,  this will be  our wo10r11s14t
14,01p11a10c00k.   I say this  with the confidence that  artists only get better.   Gro10u11p14s
14,01m11a10y 00fluctuate,  but artists are always getting better on the whole,  and all 11o14f
14,01o11u10r 00artists are dedicated and talented.   So, I can say now,  I'll see you n10e11x14t
14,01m11o10n00th, and the month after that,  and the month after,  and on.   We're here 11t14o
14,01g11r10o00w,  and become one of the more respected  and talented ansi groups..  Lat10e11r14.
