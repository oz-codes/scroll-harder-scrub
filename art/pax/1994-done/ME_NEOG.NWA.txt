02,01Dawn 00broke upon the Kentucky skies
02,01And 00the soil at the gravestone, it did rise
02,01Up f00rom the ground, skeleton with a hip bone
02,01In th00e new world, all alone.

02,01He pul00led his cowboy hat over his boney head
02,01Lookin00g to the east, he grinned a boney grin and said
02,01I'm al00one in this world but I'm still a king
02,01Because 00I can dance and I can sing.

02,01He saunter00ed along the old dirt road until he hit Tennessee
02,01For a skel00eton, he was tired and stopped by a tree
02,01He looked t00o the sky and wondered if he should care
02,01Because all 00he was was a shadow with hair.

02,01Continuing on00, he didn't worry
02,01Stopped by a b00ar because he was in a hurry
02,01Had to see his 00honey, Priscilla
02,01And get the Co00lonel, that killer.

02,01A man on a missi00on without a gun
02,01But a rebel with a 00mission is the dangerous one
02,01He had a dream, tak00e back his throne
02,01And head on home.

02,01Back to Tennessee, wh00ere the skies that much bluer
02,01He would re-capture the 00world, he was the Devil's lure
02,01Royalty with mortals and 00a reborn sinner
02,01The music was his sword and 00in the duel, he was the winner.

02,01Suddenly overcome with a wa00ve of new thought
02,01Revenge was not the answer, 00music is not iron wrought
02,01Presley was his name
02,01And revelation was his game.

02,01Elvis became a television pre00acher
02,01Another use of God's power over 00us as our teacher
02,01Elvis, he did speak of many gre00at things in the beyond
02,01Still, forgiveness for his sins 00is what he longed.

02,01Years of work went towards confor00ming people to God's view
02,01People couldn't doubt the reality 00of a skeleton who'd been slew
02,01And God smiled upon Elvis because h00e'd paid back his sins
02,01And in the end, everybody wins.

02,01The sun shone donw on his boney body00, he shone white
02,01And he was reblessed by the glimmerin00g of God's light
02,01Don't try to think too hard and don't t00ry to lie
02,01Because in the end, all you'll do is cry.

02,01Dust settled around the skeleton as he lay 00to rest in the road
02,01His sins were repaid and God had lifted the 00load
02,01As the hips of Elvis settled in the sand
02,01There was no doubt he had entered Neo Gracela00nd.
