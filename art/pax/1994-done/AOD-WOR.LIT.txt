00,01Wars of Rememberance

00,01Death. Death was in the air. Fires, shooting noises. Screaming... too many
00,01screams. Unbearable. Rustling around in the mud, trying to stay alive. The cold
00,01air was bothersome. People tried to use bodyheat of others. Rain poured down,
00,01washing the mud of the uniforms. The rain released the mud. People splashing
00,01around, running to and from the trenches. Swift lights flew past our heads.
00,01Dying people, in pain. I raised my gun and fired. "Goodbye Friend." Eyes
00,01watered in my eyes. Lowering the gun and myself, I looked at the dead corpse
00,01of my friend. Dead.. He IS dead. Why am I alive? "Watch out," screamed the
00,01Sergeant as he pushed me to the ground. Mud splashed in my face, but I
00,01realized, I was still alive. I got up, and found my uniform muddy and bloody.
00,01My friends blood... "Fire!" The guns lifted up and people fired, I brought
00,01myself up and fired. Bang! I felt an impact. Pain. I placed my hand over my
00,01heart. The blood leaked through my hands. Covered with blood, my blood. I
00,01stumbled back and forth, and died....
