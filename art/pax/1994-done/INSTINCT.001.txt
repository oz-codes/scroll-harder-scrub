15,01     Greetings and Salivations, welcome to the second text of Tribal Instincts.
15,01For now, to keep the "INSTINCT." part of the filename intact, I'm going to
15,01number these files like a quasi-fido nodelist..basically, INSTINCT.XXX where
15,01XXX is the issue in question. This file should be INSTINCT.002, thus, unless
15,01TafkaSk wimped out and changed it. Figuring that he won't, lets get on to
15,01some business.. [Well, it did happen!  It's now INSTINCT.001, because it's
15,01the first INSTINCT in all it's glory.  -TafkaSk]

15,01     0.5) (Something like an added preface P.S.) Special apologies
15,01     and groveling are sent to PiroManiak, whose handle was
15,01     mercilessly butchered by TafkaSk in the last pack.
15,01     Piro, or pMk, is in 305, and has nothing to do with that
15,01     lame "Pyromaniac" in 708 who's running a group with a
15,01     name that's never been used before.. or been used for
15,01     a comic company.. nah.. [dws]

15,01     0.6) Woops. [dws] stands for dripping with sarcasm, for those
15,01     of you who are acronym declined.

15,01     0.7) Right, now on to the initial starts of this file!

15,01     1) First off, New Arrivals! Our new tribesmen are...

15,01     Hellspawn! King Midas! Magnus! Psyberman!

15,01     A great bunch of guys, with a great bunch of talent! Welcome,
15,01     welcome, welcome, welcome! Look forward to some great new
15,01     art, as well as TafkaSk getting his ass kicked in doom (says
15,01     King Midas, the muffler man.) !  [Beats me once and thinks he
15,01     did it all the time, obviously forgetting the 20 to 2 type
15,01     butt whippins' he normally got from me, like everyone else!
15,01     Now he's too scared to play me in any other modem game too!
15,01     -TafkaSk the Unbeatable.]

15,01     2) Second off, People leaving us! Our parting tribesmen are...

15,01     NONEXISTENT! Wowee! Imagine that, when you have people who
15,01     love what they're doing, love who they're working with, and
15,01     are undoubtedly kicking ass and taking names..why would they
15,01     want to leave? B) Go read INSTINCT.TXT.

15,01     2.31495) This just in. . . Panama Jack will be taking a hiatus
15,01     from the scene as he is without possession of a device
15,01     that can MODulate and dEModulate digital signals for
15,01     transmission over phone lines. Yep, he doesn't have
15,01     a modem at the moment. We're waiting for ya, Jack!

15,01     [2.76851) This juster in. . . Chaos Breed blew a power supply
15,01     on his computer, and is waiting to get another one.  Thus he
15,01     can't get us his finished .RIP's in time for this pack.
15,01     - TafkaSk]

15,01     3) Doesn't this look like a NFO file? Bleah...
15,01     [Yer own damn fault bitch! - TafkaSk]

15,01     4) We welcome back, with open arms, to love and to hold,
15,01     Quazar and Asriel. They were on vacation, now they're back.
15,01     Asriel comes back from working on PowerPCs, FAQs, women
15,01     that tower over him, and Anarchy (the model, not the
15,01     catastrophe). Quazar comes with a freshly vacationed frame
15,01     of mind, and a new-found affection for TRiBEBot on IRC.

15,01     4.5) Speaking of FAQ's, I was going to go into a long tirade
15,01     on how I thought Asriel's FAQ's were faulty, due to a misconception
15,01     on my part.  That namely being that FAQ not only delt with them
15,01     questions, but "FAQ" sounded alot like "FACT" and that the answers
15,01     had to be more than base opinion.  I did some research, and most
15,01     FAQ's are in fact base opinion, and as such, Asriel's is ok.  Still,
15,01     the majority of answers were almost completely wrong.  - TafkaSk.

15,01     5) Cavalier has run out of things to number.
