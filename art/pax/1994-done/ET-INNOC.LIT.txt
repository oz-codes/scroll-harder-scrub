15,01Innocence Lost

15,01There was a day
15,01When joy was boundless
15,01And troubles were limited
15,01To band-aids and bruises.

15,01There was a day
15,01When laughter was free
15,01And friends would last
15,01Forever.

15,01There was a day
15,01When the world was within my grasp
15,01And anything I wanted
15,01Was mine.

15,01Those days are gone,
15,01Washed away along
15,01With my innocence.
15,01Troubles lap at my feet
15,01Like the unending waves,
15,01Friends are gone in the
15,01Wink of an eye,
15,01And there are things this soul
15,01shall never touch.
