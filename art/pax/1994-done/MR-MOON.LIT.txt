15,01                           08I have nothing to say
15,01                          08I think I am turning gay
15,01                         08I am starting to feel as one
15,01                        08I'm still reaching for the sun
15,01                       08As we watch the broad moon above
15,01                       08It is a symbol of the sacred dove
15,01                        08The moon repesents a great pride
15,01                         08Tourists always refuse a guide
15,01                          08As I sit on a very tall dune
15,01                           08I see the huge Havest Moon
