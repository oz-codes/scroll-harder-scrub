00,01I'm sick of hearing you say goodbye
00,01I'm tired of you turning your back on me
00,01I might as well shrivel up and die
00,01Your words sting me like a bee

00,01Just go away, I can't take it anymore
00,01You always leave to find someone new
00,01Yet you always come back to explore
00,01Your hatred and misloving stick to me like dew

00,01Please go away, I don't want to see you now
00,01Go away and forget about us
00,01But someway and somehow
00,01I know we'll make it again without fuss

00,01me and you
