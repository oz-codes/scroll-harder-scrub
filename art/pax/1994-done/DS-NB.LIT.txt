15,01           14The boy in the grown body stands above the rest.
15,01     14His 04pa08in03te04d b08oo03ts 14lace up tight reaching his olive gr03ee14n cut-offs.
15,01           14The shorts, big and baggy, hang limp around his hips.
15,01            14He wears a 02s00t02r00i02p00e02d 14shirt layerd over a few others,
15,01              14comfortably draped over his broad shoulders.
15,01                  14Long slender fingers reach for me,
15,01                14and I look up to the face of an angel.
15,01       14His jawbone, strict and defined, is speckled with stubble
15,01                   14and on his chin grows a gotie.
15,01                 14The room brightens with his 13s00mil13e14,
15,01        14and above his sp15ar00k15li14ng eyes, the lashes go on forever.
15,01      14Reaching his jaw, his striking gr03ee14n hair attracks all eyes,
15,01                          14including mine,
15,01                     14for he is my work of art.
