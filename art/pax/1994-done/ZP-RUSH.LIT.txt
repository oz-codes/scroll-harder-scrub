15,01"Ode to Rush"
15,01You pompus ass!
15,01How dare you tell me how to live,
15,01What's right and wrong?!
15,01Your ego gets larger
15,01With each passing day.
15,01The truth is what you tell
15,01Or so that's what you say.
15,01You make me sick 
15,01With each word you speak
15,01Condoms and gangs
15,01That shoot to kill,
15,01Related?
15,01I think now.
15,01How so?
15,01Do tell.
15,01ALternative lifestyles;
15,01And freedom of choice;
15,01Teens with babies
15,01And people with voice;
15,01All those that think-
15,01Your worst enemies
15,01Hey Rush!
15,01You stink!
