15,01             00The Revolt Newsletter #01 Completed on May 31st, 1994
00,01 04.
15,01                            Section 1 o The Founding

15,01      14As of 05/04/94, at approximately 9:30 PST, the literary group Revolt
14,01was founded...
15,01      14Woohoo.
15,01      14As far as organization is concerned, Liquidator and I have been
14,01up all night trying to initiate the group, and Liquidator is getting
14,01the sites and handling the member recruiting...
15,01      14The World Headquarters is Dimension X, and that is where most of the
14,01activity will take place as far as discussions / compilation / releases.
14,01In the future we may have a Couriering Headquarters, but that is not needed
14,01at this time.
15,01      14One thing I am trying to avoid in the formation of this new lit group
14,01is a pack delayal.. The packs will be out on the 1st of the month, whether I
14,01or anybody else likes it or not. That is the set date, and thats the way things
14,01are gonna go.
15,01      14Right now we need more poets and sites. All applications should go to
14,01Dimension X at (805)499-6865... Send 3 or more lits in a zipfile once you
14,01are validated and your name and number or VMB, and I'll look over the lits
14,01and tell you whats up with the decision...  Personally I'm looking for poetry
14,01that portrays and image, or a meaning, and projects a feeling or emotion.
14,01Those are the poems that will catch my attention. Rhyme, rhythm, and general
14,01sound of the poem is not as important to me as meaning.

15,01                             Section 2 o The Group

15,01      14Resident members, start writing.. Short stories, essays, and articles
14,01will also be accepted for submission.
15,01      14Thanks go out to Gnome for making me an awesome revolt font. I really
14,01appreciate it... and to Psyber for accepting an article about Revolt in the
14,01upcoming DAMAJ magazine.
15,01      14Great poets to look for this month: Liquidator, The Fugitive, and Faust
14,01(although his stuff is a bit morbid, its good)...
15,01      14Of course, that doesn't mean you should skim by the others.. The poets
14,01I listed up there are currently the ones who gave me the best submissions and
14,01are also new..(except for The Fugitive, but he's not really in the scene anyways
14,01save for a few random calls here and there. Nevertheless, It's great to have
14,01him in the group)
15,01      14Good lit's to look for this month: AR-DEATH.REV, AR-TWIL1.REV (if you
14,01got like an hour to read it), TF-SYSTX.REV, ALL of Liquidator's lits, and
14,01all of Faust's lits...
15,01      14Yay! I just finished the review for Blur Magazine issue #2... I hope it
14,01gets submitted..
15,01      14Argh.. I'm droning on and on.. Well, if you got this far without falling
14,01half-dead asleep (hell im falling asleep too..) I just wanted to say that all
14,01in all, we hope this literature gets spread all around the nation/world/universe
14,01and I personally hope all the members in Revolt get the credit adue to them
14,01for their submission of ALL of this great literature, and remember guyz that
14,01poetry is poetry, and there is no real rating for it...latuh!

15,01                             Section 3 o The Greetz

15,01      14I just had to do it didn't I... Aren't I a little devious tonight...

14,01section in the newsletter, its Ash.. <g> nah you guessed it.. yours truly..
