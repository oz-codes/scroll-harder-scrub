15,01Welp..
15,01        I heard alot of people bithcin' and moanin' about not having an
15,01ascii menu set (in color, but ascii..  umm, yeah), so i decided to take a
15,01quick whack at it :)  Hopefully by next pack I'll have my OBV/2 ascii
15,01menu set done (in color, but ascii..  umm, yeah) =)  you can edit the
15,01commands and stuff, i don't care, and change the colors to fit the color
15,01scheme of your board, just so you keep the RENEGADE logo thing there and,
15,01of course, my sig =)  anyhow, it's pretty nifty.

15,01oh yeah, I did one full set with commands and all, based on template.1  If
15,01you don't like template.1, you can use template.2 for all the menus, it's
15,01just that I didn't wanna go and do a 2nd menu set.  But, I included both
15,01in this zip so you can choose which one you wanna use.
