15,01                       Ode to Spot

15,01Felus Catus.  Is your taxonomic nomenclature
15,01an endothermic quadruped, carnivorous by nature?
15,01Your visual, olfactory, and auditory senses
15,01contribute to your hunting skills and natural defenses.

15,01I find myself intrigued by your sub vocal oscillations.
15,01A singular development of cat communications
15,01that obviates your basic hedonistic predilection
15,01for a rhythmic stroking of your fur to demonstrate affection.

15,01A tail is quite essential for your acrobatic talents.
15,01You would not be so agile if you lacked its counterbalance.
15,01And when not being utilized to aid in locomotion,
15,01it often serves to illustrate the state of your emotions.

15,01Oh Spot, the complex levels of behaviour you display
15,01connote a fairly well developed cognitive array.
15,01And though you are not sentient, Spot, and do not comprehend,
15,01I none the less consider you a true and valued friend.
