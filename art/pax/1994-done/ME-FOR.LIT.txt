00,01Forms

00,01In the shadows
00,01Of what used to be...
00,01There is a memory,
00,01Some bit of lingering fate,
00,01That I hold onto,
00,01With all my insanity, fresh,
00,01Life is long-

00,01Beyond these walls,
00,01Built by the suffering,
00,01There is freedom,
00,01There is hope,
00,01There is the dream...
00,01An American Dream,
00,01Never fulfilled-

00,01In these late hours,
00,01In the last retreats of my lost soul,
00,01I sit...
00,01Pulling myself up from tears,
00,01And self pity,
00,01Only to realize that I alone is all
00,01  that I have,
00,01Everything can turn into nothing with
00,01  a second's passing-

00,01Into,
00,01Out of...
00,01The shadows of the Plutonic "form",
00,01In everything we do,
00,01It's time...
00,01To create something new-
