15,01If one man whispers a nothing into the air, will any lifeform receive it?

15,01I pose that question in awe of silence.

15,01The last stand began 2000 years ago, the beginning ends...

15,01All that is left, is your coat, a bottle of pills that the pusher left behind
15,01saying 'Th really know how to pack those poppers' in grumbled, over boozed,
15,01over smoked voice, that crackled like the dust under rice paper.

15,01The window was getting bare, and your reflection brought you no more pleasure
15,01as you gazed endlessly at the person staring at you from the other side.

15,01You mind preferred the green now... So you decided to be it...

15,01You walked into the hall not caring about the hooker that lay unconcious beside
15,01your seedy neighbour's door...
15,01"The guy should be shot", you muttered under your breath, yet you somehow, in
15,01your own sick way, prayed that he heard it, so he could flutter about in a rage
15,01of sorrow, but you knew it wouldn't be...

15,01Red was your colour now, and you preferred that over the yellow...

15,01It flowed through your veins when it was good, so Why can't it work for the
15,01rest of you?
15,01Alas, your forgetting that the blue is also a product of the life fluid.
15,01So now your colour was blue, and you felt that way....
15,01'Whay does this happen to me' ,you thought as you stood at the top of the
15,01staircase feeling like you're on the edge of hell, when all it really was, was
15,01a two flight walk to the front desk, where the man named Razerek worked...
15,01He never let you down...
15,01He always had the stuff that made the blue go away...
15,01But this time you failed to see that the test proved it was too pure...
15,01You already melted it in your spoon, and pierced your LIFE walls to let the
15,01liquid do it's magic... the magic of black....
15,01YOUR world was now black...
15,01YOU had no more red... no more blue... no more green...
15,01GOD... even yellow would be better now....
15,01BUT you took the wrong turn on the rainbow highway, tried for the fast ride,
15,01you want to age fast, but you die young...

15,01WHO said it was fair....

15,01YOU did...

15,01Not I, not the chinese store owner, not the dog who wanted to fuck your leg.

15,01NO, it was only you....
15,01You left the gate open, and in came the death...
15,01If you could see before hadn the black that follows ever so close to you, you
15,01would know where the lighted door was, for now you have a reference...

15,01Forget it not, for in a time of great need, YOU will remember, and rewish to
15,01take that turn over... Yet your turn will not continue, it is over...
15,01plesant dreams and thoughts...
15,01Sleep well in your grey miss...
15,01Fear not the end but the beginning...
15,01For it is harder to climb than to fall...
