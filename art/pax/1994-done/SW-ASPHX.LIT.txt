15,01Asphyxiation



15,01Reflected in a looking glass,
15,01I peer through the eye of time.
15,01A stone gathering the moss of eons
15,01Until even it is swallowed by waves
15,01     breaking on the shore,
15,01Asphyxiating life - evermore.

15,01I stare, lost,
15,01Into that eternity.
15,01Time slows to a crawl
15,01As each grain of sand dies
15,01     in the arms of vacated dreams,
15,01Asphyxiated hopes - ever devoid of meaning.

15,01Images fade to ebony threads,
15,01And reality again asserts is control.
15,01Thoughts, like spectres, flee illumination
15,01As the doldrums of sanity are returned
15,01     by messengers traveling on wings of night,
15,01Asphyxiated - second sight.
