15,01REM Monthly.

15,01                Well hey third release for REM Inc.  I hope you 
15,01noticed the change in the name.  "REM Inc."  Yeah we have several
15,01subdivisions: QC = Quality Control <DiskMag] / SP = Silent Partners
15,01<Couriers] / STCNET = Static Msg Network ... and hopefully we can
15,01get into the demo scene as well.  So that's why I added (Inc.)
15,01INCORPORATED for people who don't know what that meant.  Well a
15,01little slow this month, everyone has been very busy.  But you 
15,01don't really want to hear that.  So one change of Central HQ's..
15,01Journey's End is know the Central Hq.  Sorry for that last pack.
15,01It was terribly huge.  We will choose more carefully on what we put
15,01in the pack.  BTW: I think most of you commented on the music in that
15,01loader.  It was done by MC MACE...  A friend of Skull Leader's...
15,01We will ask him to do some rap for REM..  I think you all liked it?
15,01Those into RAP.  Well shots out to all the new members of REM..
15,01Well this is one of those boring fucking nights when I really don't
15,01have anything to say. UGH!...  I might be in a better mood on the 
15,01March release.  

15,01                Guidelines:
15,01                REM will set guidelines this month
15,01                for people applying for sites.
15,01                New REM member applicants will be on
15,01                a one month trial basis.
15,01                Headquarters must contribute in some
15,01                shape or form.
15,01                I will get into more details on the
15,01                next release.

15,01                                                Bad Mood,
15,01                                                 Night Breed
