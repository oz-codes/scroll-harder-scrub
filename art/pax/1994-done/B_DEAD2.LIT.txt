15,01                                 Part Two

15,01        Memories linger like moths, appearing and disappearing into the
15,01darkness that envelopes the electric glows of Einsteins imagination.  The
15,01good ones, the bad ones, the moth knows no difference.  The shimmering of
15,01the lights, the electric hum of modern computerized public transportation.
15,01Step out onto the platform, a sweaty August night. The moon in the sky
15,01laughing through the clouds.  A light drizzle, spotted tears stain the old
15,01grey sidewalk.  Through the hustle bustle of the market, too many people.
15,01Duck into a dark alley.  Faces in the walls stare through the darkness.
15,01Too many people.  Into the square, crack of thunder, the down pour starts.
15,01Everyone is leaving, don't want to get wet.  Thank the storm.  See the cat,
15,01cleaning herself in the rain.  Take the pistol from the pocket.  Feel the
15,01Weight, the weight of so many things.  Heavy on the cart, too hard to pull.
15,01Feel the trigger, the release.  Seconds tick by and back again.  See the
15,01cat.  My witness.  Drop the weights.
