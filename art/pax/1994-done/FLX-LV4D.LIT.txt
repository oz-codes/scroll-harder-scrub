15,01                      12Now, in the dead season
15,01                      12of words & ideas, things,
15,01                      12I come back to your letters
15,01                      12like a scientist; disassembling,

15,01                      12passionless, a speculator
15,01                      12with little eyes. Your notes
15,01                      12like "an axe for the frozen
15,01                      12sea within" cannot coax

15,01                      12me from this letter, Anne.
15,01                      12This year, in the time the dead
15,01                      12have made, I've considered
15,01                      12your many little Christs. You said

15,01                      12that he wept, broke his fast,
15,01                      12died & was put in a cave,
15,01                      12woke into the dark
15,01                      12company of rats, forgave

15,01                      12everyone...then he was gone.
15,01                      12Deep within your Christ-days,
15,01                      12I find the emaciated
15,01                      12dying God to whom you pray;

15,01                      12A stone tower, a yellow star,
15,01                      12A hothouse flower shrouded by night.
