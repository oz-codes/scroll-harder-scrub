15,01        ::sigh:: Well, what to say? Due to the fact that GenoCide is out of
15,01    town at the moment, the spot of nfo writing and pack organizing falls
15,01    to Neurotic. It's 3:08pm, 52 minutes before the assigned deadline for
15,01    the pack, and Hound and I are have almost finished completing the final
15,01    ansi submission for this month. I feel somewhat 'iffy' about what
15,01    people's response will be to the pack this month.

15,01        Included in the pack is HD-RIP.ZIP, a little pack Hound put
15,01    together when he discovered someone had accused him of ripping one of
15,01    the ansis he drew last month. Included in this mini-pack is Hound's
15,01    ansi, the ansi he is accused of ripping, a scanned picture of the
15,01    comic book page that both the ansis are taken from, and a nfo file
15,01    by Hound that shoots down all the points that were made in STOLEN!.ZIP

15,01        If you have already skipped on to the member listings this month,
15,01    you will notice that there are a LOT of new faces this month. The first
15,01    person to formally join Union this month was PennyWise, who will still
15,01    remain with his demo group, Apex, but will also work hard on coding
15,01    loaders and modifying the viewer. Unfortunately, PennyWise changed
15,01    residency during the last week of June, and we have been unable to
15,01    track him down as of yet. The result of this is that the viewer this
15,01    month is the same as last month's. Please bare with it.

15,01        The first addition to the ansi department this month is DarkForce,
15,01    formerly of Imperial. I am quite impressed with his work so far, and
15,01    hope to see him continue to improve under the Union name. Einstien
15,01    rejoins Union's ansi department, and hopefully we will see some of his
15,01    work next month. Twisted Mind, formerly Grey of Rage, joins Union's
15,01    ansi department as our first member from overseas. He is from Israel,
15,01    and we should see some stuff by him next month.

15,01        This month's rips were supplied to us by K-Spiff, a new member
15,01    formerly from a short-lived 713 group called Suicide. I find his
15,01    cartoony style of rips pretty cool, a step away from the usual comic
15,01    book character art.

15,01        For those of you who complained about the lack of vga artwork last
15,01    month, complain no longer! Three new vga artists join this month,
15,01    Quisling, formerly of Crime, Spleef and Vandal. They all managed to
15,01    turn out a few pictures this month and will hopefully continue to do
15,01    so in the future.

15,01        The only s3m in this pack comes from our newest musician, Pinion.
15,01    All I can say is listen to it, it is rather cool.

15,01        The greatest inflow of members this month comes from our couriering
15,01    department. Now all we have to do is organize them. :). The new dudes
15,01    who you should see spreading around the pack are Taz, Ipstar, Mephisto,
15,01    Lord Exile, Rav and Abover.

15,01        In spite of all the new members, Union encountered several problems
15,01    this month. Sole Assassin's computer broke, and there is a noticable
15,01    lack of ansis from him. Streaker's arm broke, and there is a noticable
15,01    lack of ansis from him. Satanic Goldfish has been busy with his band,
15,01    and hasn't had time to write music. Future Assassin has been busy
15,01    juggling three girlfriends (and playing muds and ufo :), so there is a
15,01    noticable lack of tunes from him. Hound has been working double shifts,
15,01    so he was only able to make one last minute (literally) submission. The
15,01    loss of contact with PennyWise has already been mentioned, and will
15,01    hopefully be rectified within the next week. GenoCide is away so I've
15,01    been forced to put the pack together this month, if you find any
15,01    faults, point in my direction. At least there isn't any menu sets for
15,01    me to forget to include again. ::grin::

15,01        Union Net is currently unoperational due to the fact that I put
15,01    down my board, Programmed Illusion, the main Union Net hub. The net
15,01    will be going back up circa as soon as Qur'an returns from vacation.

15,01        For some totally UNKNOWN reason sauce fucked up Vandal's pcxs.
15,01    I tried converting them to gifs, but my conversion program didn't
15,01    recognize them. This delayed the pack for about half an hour as I
15,01    discovered the error only a few minutes before I intended to release
15,01    it. The only solution I could find was to not sauce Vandal's artwork.

15,01        A strange bug called laziness and procrastination has hit the Union
15,01    team this month, but thanks to the new additions to the group we didn't
