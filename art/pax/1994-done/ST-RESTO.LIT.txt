15,01The Restoration

15,01She lives on 
15,01Inside of me,
15,01From her soul
15,01I will never be free.
15,01I see her beauty
15,01Flowing within,
15,01The child she bore
15,01Through original sin.
15,01The magical touch
15,01Of her hand,
15,01Lives on in the babe
15,01Of earthly land.
15,01For God hath taken
15,01The one I adore,
15,01In place of another
15,01To love even more.
