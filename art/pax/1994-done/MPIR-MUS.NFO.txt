15,01     In this month's pack, I bring you a classical piece in 669 format.
15,01'Unattained Dreams in C major.'  I suggest that you use external speakers,
15,01rather than headphones.  If you do use headphones, and you have a stereo
15,01soundcard, be sure to select the option to play it in mono, rather than stereo.
15,01Stereo works great with external speakers, but it sounds awkward with
15,01headphones for some reason or another.

15,01     Anyways, EMPiRE is still looking for more musicians.  If you think that
15,01you would like to join us, please fill out an application and send us a song or
15,01two.

15,01     Greets go out to musicians everywhere, especially Mosaic, C.C.Catch, 
15,01NECROS and all those fine musicians out there who make it great to own a 
15,01soundcard!
