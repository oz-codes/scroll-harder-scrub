15,01            Domination From Above

15,01Many years ago, where there was unbearable heat,
15,01people witnessed an unimaginable feat.
15,01They had all they needed, lead pleasant lives,
15,01glowing faces of men, children and wives.
15,01The meaning of 'slavery' they did not know,
15,01angry and hateful, they could never feel so.
15,01They enjoyed and cherished what they had,
15,01perhaps it was this that made them go mad.
15,01Unprovoked, things changed for the worse,
15,01small thefts committed, un-rehearsed.
15,01People turned against one another,
15,01finally, from the abbey, stepped out a brother.
15,01Cross in hand, he held it high,
15,01from the skies, soon came a cry.
15,01Fell from high above, a giant beast,
15,01ripped the brother appart, he lay deceased.

15,01The citizens could not believe the horrible sight,
15,01their brother dead, the beast to bring fright.
15,01The cries, the screams, could have been heard for miles,
15,01they've never done so before, it wipped off their smiles.
15,01Who was this devil? This beast that fell from above?
15,01He hadn't come for peace, and surely not love.
15,01He began by calling upon his father, the almighty sin,
15,01the sky soon turned to blood, pure hatred within.

15,01The people grieved for many weeks,
15,01prayed to God, their souls for keeps.
15,01Father and son, continued their calling,
15,01demons upon demons simply kept falling.
15,01No one could stop what had occured,
15,01the final judgement? Court is ajourned?

15,01The final calling brought most dismay,
15,01Jesus our savior had nothing to say.
15,01They pushed him around as if nothing strong,
15,01soon came a light, chants, and harmonic songs.
15,01This force broke through the blood above,
15,01the sky became clearer, here comes a dove.
15,01A sign of goodness, the evil beasts could not bear,
15,01God came to help the people, in times of dispair.

15,01With a bolt of lightning, God whipped them to oblivion,
15,01no one survived his power, not one in a million.

15,01The trans was over, the people could see,
15,01the darkness was over, there was nothing to be.
15,01Total destruction in this town of peace,
15,01time to start the clean up, the fighting had ceased.
15,01All of a sudden, a human stood high,
15,01their brother was alive now, did he not die?

15,01"Our savior has brought me back to existance",
15,01"let's thank him with praises, begin this instance."
15,01And so it went on, everything anew,
15,01their brother came back, much thanking to do.

15,01Follow the steps of our Lord, our Master,
15,01evil grows fast, but good grows faster.
15,01                                            Domination From Above
