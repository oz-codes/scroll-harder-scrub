15,01Intracacies of Johnson

15,01Fake brutes, fake gods
15,01I spit down and bite your claws.
15,01Rip down and take out, 
15,01with the fallacies that you shout.

15,01Bareback and with soul,
15,01you will say grace and turn old
15,01but not without that tiger at your tail
15,01the leader of LIFE, dragged by a snail.

15,01Stop shouting, and open your eyes.

15,01desalvo... dark.  1994.  spaced out and cryptical.
