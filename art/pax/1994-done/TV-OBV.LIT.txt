15,01        Oblivion is calling,
15,01        Ever faster falling,
15,01        Descending in to madness.

15,01        Tempest winds are blowing,       
15,01        Urgency is growing,
15,01        Descending in to madness.

15,01        Blinded by the pain,
15,01        Wandering in the rain,
15,01        The foul winds they blow,
15,01        My sense of evil grows,
15,01        As I descend in to madness.

15,01        Beasts lust for my flesh,
15,01        Demons for my soul,
15,01        My time is nearly here, now I shall soon perish,
15,01        Enter it I shall, Satan's reeking hole.
15,01        As I descend in to madness.

15,01        Then she came, a light in the dark,
15,01        With her soothing words, she left a holy mark,
15,01        My was to be saved, my life was not lost,
15,01        Foilded was Satan, his wicked plans were tempest tossed,
15,01        Now I transcend the madness.

15,01        Realities lines grow firmer, my mind it does grow stronger,
15,01        Twisted shapes in darkness my soul will bear no longer,
15,01        Now my tale is done, my work is left yet still,
15,01        Attack he may yet do, but I will win by strength of will,
15,01        I see no more the madness.
