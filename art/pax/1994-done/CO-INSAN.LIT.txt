15,01Through a tumbling mist
15,01I reach the enigmatic conclusion

15,01                         A title, a name
15,01                        A position or rank
15,01                      Nothing is given to me
15,01                        Nothing is sacred

15,01                                            I want KUDOS!  And FAME!
15,01                               And lots and lots and lots of friends
15,01                           And most of all, I want everybody to know
15,01                                              I've reached Insanicon

15,01              The penultimate mental accomplishment
15,01              Nothing comes close, ignore the others
15,01          I think, therefore I think, therefore I think
15,01                But thinking will be our downfall
15,01                Spare yourself and stop attempting
15,01          To locate a niche for your pathetic existence

15,01Realize that Chicago is burning
15,01Los Angeles is the land of the dead
15,01New York is becoming another planet
15,01America is lost, it has been for so long
15,01It's too late, no turning around
15,01Come one come all
15,01To the Insanicon

15,01              A place where your ambitions, initiatives are replaced
15,01                                          By those of Digital Master
15,01                                 And your will is no longer your own
15,01                     Your mind is just another rusting, rotting pawn
15,01                        In the long struggle between terminal brains
15,01                              And you'll give in... you WILL give in
15,01                                 Because you know you really want to

15,01                  A horde of lifeless electrons
15,01            Spinning and twirling through a thin wire
15,01       (Single line, folks... one behind you, one in front)
15,01                 They're much more than they seem
15,01               Say 'goodbye, friend' to your brain
15,01                   Your eyes, maybe your tongue
15,01           And submit to the guidance of Digital Master
15,01                   Because everyone is doing it
15,01                  And because it's a lot of fun
