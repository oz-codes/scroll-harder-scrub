15,01i am trapped in a vortex of space and time.
15,01ideas and philosophies whirl around me and caress my scarred and swollen body.
15,01the light is blinding my eyes and burning my lips.
15,01the heat is burning my nostrils and throat.
15,01wisps of thought spin around, caught in endless eddies of time.

15,01it is beautiful.
15,01space and reality are now one.
15,01i see myself in relation to it all.
15,01i am everything.
15,01images flash before my eyes.
15,01childhood.
15,01puberty.
15,01first kiss.
15,01prom.
15,01sex.
15,01my job.
15,01my wife.
15,01my children.
15,01seconds tick by and back again.

15,01was it all worth it?

15,01it is warm and i am tired.
15,01i want to go to sleep.
15,01but i really must wait for the firemen to put
15,01out the fire.

15,01         and i want to go home."
