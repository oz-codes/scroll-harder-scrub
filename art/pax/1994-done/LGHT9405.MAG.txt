08,01Introduction:

15,01     00We decided to make this magazine as sort of a place where we could
00,01things that the general pubic needed to know about LiGHT.  This will only be
00,01usefull if you care about the underlyings of the group, or if you want to know
00,01about what kind of stuf was going on in the scene.  Have phun.


08,01Where'd We Go?:

15,01     00Well, LiGHT has gone through a pretty bad month as far as everything goes.
00,01Towards the end of April, The CyberRock BBS, the World Headquarters, went down
00,01due to several reasons personal to me, the former sysop. In a search for a new
00,01WHQ, Stussy, decided to put up a board that had been setup and ready to go for
00,01several months.  Probably about two weeks after the opening of the Freeside
00,01Matrix (Stussy's board).  He came home and found his mother board was fried.
00,01Hence, the second WHQ was down.  We needed to find a place where all the
00,01members of LiGHT could congregate, and where all the files for the packet would
00,01be handled.  A personal friend of mine, TimberWulf, said that he'd be willing
00,01have his board act as the WHQ until Stussy could fix his mother board.  The
00,01Wulf's Den, a well established board in the 303 area code, then took over the
00,01responsibilities of WHQ.  As you can probably see, the members of LiGHT were
00,01shuffled back and forth a fair amount.  The last member to get on Wulf's Den
00,01called there on about the 25th of April.  There was a definate communication
00,01breakdown there.  Anyways, LiGHT has regrouped and is ready to go!


08,01LANDSnet:   (Light Artist 'N Distrobution Network)

15,01     00During the process of shuffling WHQ's, a new idea sprung up.  We decided
00,01to form a net to link all of the Distrobution sites and Affiliated boards
00,01together so that, in the case of another problem, all LiGHT members could be
00,01located and told what was going on.  Since then, the net has expaned to all
00,01Headquarters, Distros, and Affiliates.  So if you are interested in joining,
00,01and your area code is devoid of LiGHT boards, then give me a call at the Wulf's
00,01Den, and we will check you out.

08,01Case of the Dissapearing Distros:

15,01     00At one point in time, there were about 6 LiGHT Distrobution sites in the
00,01303 area code and beyond.  Among these lurked Chemical Overdose (Ansiman) and
00,01Virtual Utopia (Pluto).  Well, as it turned out, someone in 303 decided to get
00,01back at the sysops of all the Vision/X boards (of which, COD and VU were the
00,01only two).  So they used a unknown hack or back door, and deleted 90% of both
00,01HD's.  Due to this, and other incidents, Ansiman has decided to take down COD
00,01indefinately.  Pluto, in the true spirit of the Phreak, decided to switch
00,01software to a less hackable brand, and keeps thoughts of revenge deep in his
00,01mind.  Not necessisarily due to these events, we will be limiting the number of
00,01distrobution sites in each area code to three.


08,01Where'd THEY Go?:

15,01     00With everyone going down or changing or what not, its pretty hard to
00,01figure out what the hell is going on.  As far as we know, two groups besides
00,01LiGHT have gone through several drastic changes.  Below are captures of things
00,01that I heard about TRiBE and GOTHiC:

15,01     08GOTHiC:

15,01     00Not much has come our way concerning GOTHiC, but from what we understand,
00,01GOTHiC is no more.  The group kind of fell apart, and no one is currently
00,01trying to revive it.  One member went to ACiD, and within hours, several more
00,01had followed.  SiDS has been invited to TRiBE, and he accepted the invitation.
00,01Several other members were invited to TRiBE, and I am unaware of what their
00,01responces were.  So, Gothic is no more.
