15,01      (18 U.S.C. 2510 et seq.), notice is hereby given that there are no

15,01      private or confidential electronic communications.

15,01The System Operator can, and often will, read all messages left on this
15,01system, including "Private" messages addressed to persons other than the
15,01system operator, not normally available to other users.  The system operator
15,01reserves the right to delete any message, regardless of whether such message
15,01has been received by its intended recipient(s).  The system operator also
15,01reserves the right to change the status of a message designated "Private"
15,01so that such message is public and available to all callers.  The status
15,01of a message may be changed whenever, in the sole discretion of the system
15,01operator, it is believed appropriate to do so.  Your continued use of this
15,01BBS constitutes acceptance of the system operator's discretion in this
15,01regard.  Your Sysop will exercise the utmost discretion in this regard; I
15,01generally change status of a message only when it is an informational message,
15,01of value to other users, and really should not be "private".
