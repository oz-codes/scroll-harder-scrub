15,01                                                  RAGE!!!
15,01     The darkness was a over whelming force in the night,
15,01          there was a disconcerning feeling of ill right.         by Frost Byte
15,01               I know not where this harsh emotion hails,                   CiA
15,01                but without it, I feear that I will fail.                 10GND

15,01I feel as though I am alone, an outcast among the masses.
15,01 Forced to be constantly supressed in all social classes.
15,01           Lost aimlessly in the sure numbers, depressed.
15,01My idividual creativity destroyed, effectively supressed.

15,01        Who am I?  Am I my own person or am I a creation?
15,01              A singular mind, dreaminf gor emancipation?
15,01    Shall I ever be free from this prison that I am held?
15,01         Or am I stuck to play the hadn that I was dealt.

15,01               "Release me from this Hell," my only plea,
15,01                     a emotional cry, a dream to be free.
15,01    Am I to forever to be trapped aimlessly in this cage?
15,01            Exiled, to feel nothing but the Soul's Rage??
