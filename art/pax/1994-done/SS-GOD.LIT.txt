15,01I'm so alone tonight, the stars my only friend.
15,01This is my personal fight, of which may never end.
15,01Are you watching me from the sky, so I cannot see?
15,01Have you told me nothing but lies, do you not care for me?

15,01Once I was walking through a park, and I thought I heard a sound.
15,01I spun and peered through the dark, but no one was around.
15,01Yet I felt your eyes upon me, glaring sharp with hate.
15,01For I have never felt true glee, my pain does not abate.

15,01From this pain I swiftly run, consumed I'm afraid to be.
15,01But I can not find the fun, that's supposed to be for me.
15,01All I see is fearful hate, boredom and sorrow plague my mind.
15,01Mine is a pain that does not abate, the evil of mankind.

15,01But is there more than just man, something lurking in the sky?
15,01Someone with a higher plan, who's greater than you and I?
15,01Perhaps you must prove your worth, keep me from being bored?
15,01For my short time on earth, shall I reap an eternal reward?

15,01It's almost like you are there, but you only bring a frown.
15,01It's almost like you may care, but I'll only be let down.
15,01Perhaps because my hope's so high, that it can never be.
15,01Have you told me nothing but lies, do you not care for me?
15,01
