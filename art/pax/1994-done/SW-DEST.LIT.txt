15,01- Destiny -


15,01Ships are sailing on forever
15,01Searching for a destiny
15,01Upon the shore they find me
15,01With my brow upon my knee.

15,01My head I bow in prayer
15,01As I seek to find my maker,
15,01Look up and see the ships
15,01That sail across the breakers.

15,01Wild thril leaps through my soul
15,01Like a bolt of electricity
15,01As it appears to me
15,01That I may have found my destiny.

15,01God forgotten, I rush to the sands
15,01Waving my hands to the waves beyond,
15,01Praying now to the waves,
15,01That the sailors will release my bonds.

15,01Ships draw closer and I begin
15,01To see the people that draw near to me
15,01With fear in my heart and trepidation,
15,01It is tribal warriors that I see.

15,01Turn to run, but all to late,
15,01The hands of time have sealed my fate,
15,01Rock glances off my brow,
15,01And I fall to the ground to die and wait.

15,01Again I pray, but now for life,
15,01Rather than pagan death in the night.
15,01My utmost prayer is not to be
15,01Main course in a cannibal dinner rite.

15,01But not to be, I fall in death
15,01As my maker condescends,
15,01Says to me that my fatal mistake
15,01Was to place him below my fears of men.

15,01I cry as I fall into the pit,
15,01In my heart, my soul rebounds,
15,01For some reason, maybe mercy,
15,01I see clouds instead of ground.

15,01Somehow in my last gasping breath
15,01My maker heard my dying call,
15,01And with purified mercy,
15,01I revel in the heaven that forgives us all.
