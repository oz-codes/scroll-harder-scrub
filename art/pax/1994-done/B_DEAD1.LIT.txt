15,01     He walks down the street through the crowded market. Hands in pockets.
15,01Past the carts full of fruits and trinkets of a million worlds.  People
15,01bustle around carrying their purchases and wears.  A small 13o08range 13c08at 15sits
15,01on the top of a nearby cart laden with 04tomatoes15.  Her Stomach growls, it has
15,01been six days since she has eaten.  She stares at him as he walks by.  He
15,01weaves his way through the market, the birds weave their way through the 14dark
15,01clouds overhead.  The 13c08at 15jumps from the cart, she follows him in the 14shadows15.

15,01He turns into a 14dark 15alley.  Faces in the 14dark 15walls watch him as he walks
15,01by.  The alley opens up into the square.  People of every kind are gathered
15,01in the square.  Thousands of words in thousands of languages drift through,
15,01waiting for an ear to land in.  He walks to the middle of the square.  The
13,01c08at 15climbs to a nearby windowsill, sits in the potted lillies.  A 00white
00,01flash15.  A deafening crash shatters the square.  It echoes out to the street.
15,01The people run into doors and through alleys.  The downpour starts.  He
15,01carresses the 00r15evolver in his pocket.  The 13o08range cat 15jumps to a porch.
15,01The echoes of distant footprints and voices drift away somewhere dry.  He is
15,01alone with the shadows and the 12rain 15in the square.  The 13c08at 15licks her paws
15,01and starts to clean her whiskers.  Slowly he pulls the weapon from it's
15,01hiding place.  A 00bright flash15, a 00thunderous crack15.  A single 08brass shell
15,01falls through the smoke to the ground.  The puddles run dark with marroon.
15,01Memories melt away like 13pink cotton candy 15in the 12rain15.  The 12rain 15cascading
15,01off the roofs, washing away the red.  The small 13o08range 13c08at 15leaps off the
15,01porch and leaves down the alley to find some breakfast.
