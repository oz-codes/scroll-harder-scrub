15,01broken wood.

15,01enter this land of twisted turns
15,01this land of hidden snares
15,01where the rich lay their poisoned ferns
15,01and where we pay their fares

15,01a herd of cattle in the end run
15,01different only because of our shape
15,01to be stuffed inside a baking bun
15,01which they let rot under their cape

15,01so your the king and country all
15,01how do you do i am mister tree
15,01better known to you as mister small
15,01or how about mister soon to be obscurity

15,01no we will not last forever
15,01we will not be the last living cells
15,01we will rot together
15,01for without us you'll hear hells bells

15,01grateful dead.cia
