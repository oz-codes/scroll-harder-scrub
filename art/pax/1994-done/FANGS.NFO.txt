15,01  So what have we gained by using FANGS instead of SAUCE?

15,01  1) With the use of an unique seconds value in the DOS time stamp  
15,01     useless disk access and CPU work is reduced without majorly
15,01     hacking DOS (seconds field isn't shown via the DIR command.)chitecture
15,01for Universal Comment Extensions.)  Unfortunatly, their format was far from  
15,01  2) A more efficent base record format that has more expansive file types 
15,01     and has more room for additions (34 bytes vs 23 bytes.)r this format.

15,01  3) A flexable, commpact comment area (up to 65,533 characters vs up to
15,01     256 lines 64 charactors wide for a max of 16,384 characters) thatrmat.  
15,01     is capable of supporting an MCi system in the future. myself and should 
15,01be avaible shortly.  We also plan to release source code in assist other 
15,01       In addition because the two formats are parelell in many aspects, it  
15,01  shouldn't be hard to write a conversion utility.ormat, just because a large 
15,01group supports it.

15,01        GOTHiC - Like what you see? sitting there for 5 minutes.  Another
15,01problem is an unflexable and limited comment format that could never support

15,01        However, SAUCE did introduce some ingenious concepts that should be

15,01        SiDSthe basic 128 byte record as the last 128 bytes and their format
15,01for recording file formats and file format information.  I have used their 
15,01better ideas, but have improved, revised and added enough to justify a 
15,01different name.  Tasmaniac, still deserves praise for what he did right, it 
15,01just needed to be made more functional.


15,01The FANGS tagging system

15,01        A file is tagged as having FANGS by having a seconds value in its 
15,01time stamp of 62.  Since the seconds field of the DOS time stamp supports 
15,01values from 0..31 x 2 (0..62), this is a valid yet unused value.  Because 
15,01files are tagged in this manor, programs that support FANGS will not open a 
15,01ton of files that don't have FANGS.  This dramiticly reduces the amout of 
15,01disk access and CPU use.

15,01The Basic FANGS Record and Layout

15,01        An EOF marker is used seperate the FANGS from the rest of the file 
15,01(ASCII #26.)  After the EOF is the comment section (to be explained later.)  
15,01Then the last 128 bits is the basic FANGS record. 
15,01 
15,01Here is the basic layout:

15,01     |               |
15,01     |   FILE DATA   |  Regular file data.

15,01     | COMMENT BLOCK |  Optional Comment area.
