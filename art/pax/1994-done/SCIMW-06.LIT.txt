15,01Grafted mask on the eyes of a fool.
15,01an innocent face is his deceitful guise
15,01somewhere within, truth is burried
15,01the mask is worn to hide the lies.

15,01Crafted veil on the mind of a fool.
15,01inner troubles threaten to tear him apart
15,01life beneath the veil is a nightmare
15,01the struggle burns deep inside his heart.

15,01Crumbling wall around the soul of a fool.
15,01ragged war seems ready to let truth run free
15,01escaping from the walls, truth stares
15,01and in the mirror, I gaze at a reflection of me.

15,01die trying. . . there is hope. . . time
15,01will dissolve the walls. . . h o p e . . .
