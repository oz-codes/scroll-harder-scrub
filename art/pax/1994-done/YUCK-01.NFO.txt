15,01    Well this is the first issue of YUCK in a RAiD Rendition.  RAiD's version
15,01of YUCK is the same as NATiON's version was, we take some of our best artists
15,01first work and display it for you.  You can either get a good laugh at it or
15,01get inspired, because what you see shows how much one can improve.

15,01    00T15his months YUCK pak includes work from Misery(Grateful Dead)& Napalm
15,01(Prophet).  Misery's work you may notice is all signed with the affil RAiD.
15,01This is because about a year ago I tried to get this group going but due to lack

15,01of experience and support we sputtered and died.  Napalm is our great fontist
15,01Prophet, you wont recognize him from the work you see here and no he doesnt do
15,01anymore pics..:)
