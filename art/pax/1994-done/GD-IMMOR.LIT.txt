15,01Immortal Child

15,01formed a hedge from nothing
15,01saw evolution wasn't something
15,01told my ma i was coming
15,01but i ran and kept on running

15,01chose my path without deciding
15,01walked on boldly without thinking
15,01i am immortal while others are dying
15,01untouchable but still i'm bleeding

15,01clapping my hands for inspiration
15,01lost in the lapse of persperation
15,01mind's clogged as Tetly Station
15,01called in by my citation
