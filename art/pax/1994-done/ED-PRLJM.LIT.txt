00,01        6:45 Am.. BEEEEPPP... "And as I said Robin, this new flavor of
00,01my favorite Ice Tea Drink, Snapple, is outrageous!  Pink-Tropical
00,01Fruit-Kiwi-Cherry Diet Iced Tea.. Lets have my favorite band, Pearl Jam,
00,01take us out to another commercial break.. This is Howard Stern, and this
00,01is the Howard Stern Show."

00,01        Hmm.. Pearl Jam?  Just like last week I coulda sworn he said the
00,01Meat Puppets were his favorite... But ah well... I could care less,
00,01everyone's entitled to their own opinions.  So I went upstairs and took
00,01a shower.

00,01        Less then an hour later, I was standing next to my locker, still
00,01half dazed.  One of my good friends walks up, and we start talking.
00,01Bells ring... Periods fly by.. And before I know it, I'm sitting in
00,01sixth period Literature Class... Urg.. What a drag..

00,01        My teacher gets pissed at one of my friends, yells at him and
00,01says "Thats it!  You've annoyed me enough, you can't listen to Pearl Jam
00,01for a week in this school.."..

00,01        "WHAT?!" I shout to myself.. Pearl Jam in this school?  Huh?  I
00,01mean, I was sleeping through my first five periods, and lunch, but how'd
00,01I miss something like this?  Something was definatly wrong here..

00,01        "THOMAS!", snaps my teacher, "Wake up and tell me what point of
00,01view the story `The Split Cherry Tree' is in."

00,01        "God damnit" I thought to myself "I knew I should start doing
00,01homework.. "  Still tring to think of a decent answer, the PA speaker
00,01starts to rock... "Thank god ", I thought to myself... 

00,01        "As of 1:19 PM, EST" my principle starts to explain, "Our
00,01president, William Jefferson Clinton, has resigned his position, and
00,01Edward Vedder has been unaimously elected to the position in special
00,01elections held in Seattle."

00,01        "Uhh.. What the fuck is going on here?  What the hell kind of
00,01dream is this?  Uh, if this is `The Twilight Zone', y'all can take off
00,01the human masks and show me your pig faces..." I quietly mumbled to
00,01myself...

00,01        Cheers erupted as I heard my principle continue.. "Mr. Vedder
00,01has no declared that all schools should close, and everyone gets free
00,01tickets from TicketMaster to any concert they desire.."

00,01        "Am I the last sane person on this planet?", I thought.  I mean,
00,01I love the ideas of no school and free tickets just as much as the next
00,01guy, but Eddie Vedder as president? Wow, something is going wrong here.

00,01        All the kiddies start to run out.  I causally make my way past
00,01the meek, lockers being torn apart by the deliquents, the geeks being
00,01thrown into trashcans, hell, I think I saw one or two of my teachers
00,01getting shoved into lockers.

00,01        There was a riot at the West Coast Video... Shrewn pieces of
00,01tickets getting flung around... REM sold out in 9 minutes.. Green Day
00,01sold out in 3... The Wiz couldn't handle the amount of people coming to
00,01buy Pearl Jam Tapes and CD's, that they just torched the place, killing
00,013...

00,01        I flick on the news... "And to recap our top stories," Dan
00,01Rather goes on, "Eddie Veder is now the President of the United States..
00,01He has also been named head of the United Nations in New York, head of
00,01the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and has been awarded the Noble
00,01Prizes for Peace, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Being the Coolest Guy
00,01on This Planet, thus, making him the first person to win five Noble
00,01Prizes in one day.." Whoa.. Back up.  Did Dan Rather just say "Coolest"?
00,01Uh.. Now something is wrong...

00,01        A week passed.. Eddie Veder was still President, he was also
00,01elected president of 148 other Countries, while their lead guitarist was
00,01elected to president of 32 other Countries.. And the rest of the
00,01countries that didn't elect either of them, are small Third World
