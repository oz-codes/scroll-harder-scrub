15,01Harvest Moon

15,01'Free me Lord, leave me be,
15,01I cannot pay you, that you can surely see,
15,01The rains do not come, the crops die out,
15,01I'd rather not be another body, lying about.'

15,01Instead of sympathy, I recieved a smile,
15,01I turned back, ready to walk that mile,
15,01I must have misunderstood, he asked me to return,
15,01He slapped me hard, his face quite stern.

15,01I returned home, gathered what I should,
15,01I had to give much more than I could,
15,01What was I to do, go hungry once more?
15,01Or feed my children and feel quite sore?

15,01My little boy asked, 'How did it go?'
15,01I tried to smile and replied, 'I do not know',
15,01As he shrank away, I knew what needed to be done,
15,01I would do it all, for the sake of my son.

15,01We gathered allies, we would not pay,
15,01We would have our rightful say,
15,01'We have nothing to give, we do not need more pain,
15,01Give us some time, all we need is rain'.

15,01Our Lord stood up, with an evil grin,
15,01'Tis not my concern what could have been,
15,01In exchange for this minor task,
15,01I give you protection, of me, this you ask?'

15,01We shrank away, he was right,
15,01We did not have any more will to fight,
15,01Time to turn back, to our so called 'home'
15,01All the way, my mind seemed to roam.

15,01I lay that night, wondering 'Where is the rain,
15,01My children and I cannot bear any more pain',
15,01A voice carried in the wind, 'Worry not, the rains will come soon'
15,01I stared into the eyes of the Harvest Moon.
