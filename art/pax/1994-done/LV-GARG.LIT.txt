15,01My Short But Exciting Life as a Mutant Gargoyle
15,01by Lord Valgamon

15,01As I awoke that fateful morning,
15,01I could feel something was wrong.
15,01The events that quickly followed
15,01inspired me to write this song.
15,01My hands had grown distorted,
15,01I now had lengthy claws.
15,01My face was all contorted,
15,01Fangs protruded from my jaws.
15,01Wings had sprouted from my shoulders,
15,01leathery and black as night.
15,01And the reddish color of my eyes
15,01told me something wasn't right.
15,01As I looked at myself in the mirror,
15,01I saw something I couldn't believe.
15,01Not even in my wildest nightmares
15,01such a beast could I conceive.
15,01In a howling fit of pent-up rage,
15,01I smashed a wall and knocked it out!
15,01Then, flying above the tree tops,
15,01fiery breath from my mouth did spout!
15,01It wasn't long before I heard
15,01the wailing sirens closing in.
15,01I could barely hear myself roar
15,01above the awful, noisy din.
15,01Policemen ran forth from their cars,
15,01aiming their guns at my hide.
15,01And though bullets bounced right off my skin,
15,01not a single one penetrated inside.
15,01In triumphant glory I torched them all,
15,01ripping apart their nets of mesh!
15,01The sizzling could be heard beneath
15,01the screams of roasting, burning flesh!
15,01This continued on for several days,
15,01and I began to be amused.
15,01My flaming attacks on city hall
15,01were headlined on the evening news.
15,01After laying waste to the entire town,
15,01and collecting all the loot I could hoard,
15,01A startling realization came...
15,01and I discovered... that I was bored.
15,01The army was no challenge for me,
15,01the national guard was a piece of cake!
15,01Any plane that flew my way
15,01was guaranteed to crash-land, baked.
15,01They tried and tried to bring me down,
15,01always trying to cut a deal.
15,01But nothing they could offer me
15,01held the slightest bit of long-term appeal.
15,01I cried, "I want a Pentium!"
15,01"With lots of apps to run!"
15,01The computer science guys at Yale
15,01made sure that this was quickly done.
15,01So they gave me this computer
15,01at 100 megahertz it really cooked
15,01but unfortunately I forgot
15,01and left one detail overlooked.
15,01My claws weren't fit for typing
15,01I couldn't read the tiny screen.
15,01So I began to roar and torch things
15,01and yell out phrases most obscene.
15,01It was at this time, however,
15,01that my guard I did let down
15,01they were able to subdue me
15,01and secured me to the ground.
15,01And while I was captive
15,01they injected me in my throat
15,01with what I came to realize
15,01was Mutation Antidote!
15,01As I began the shrinking process
15,01my powers quickly faded
15,01and when it was finally over
15,01I was left feeling quite jaded.
15,01So as they hauled me off to prison
15,01I could only contemplate
15,01why I gave in to computers
15,01when I could have ruled the state.
