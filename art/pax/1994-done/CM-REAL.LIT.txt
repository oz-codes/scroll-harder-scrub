15,01                                 Reality

15,01When people hold a racial grudge
15,01When they're close-minded, and will not budge
15,01When their reasons just make no sense
15,01I wonder how they can be so dense

15,01When one is beaten, like Rodney King
15,01When civil rights don't mean a thing
15,01When one is judged by his race
15,01He's made to feel out of place

15,01What's a black guys who's white, or a white guy who's black?
15,01One's race doesn't determine how a person should act
15,01When you're prejudice, it can be seen in your gaze
15,01It's not just whites, it goes both ways

15,01When one gets blamed for his ancestor's sins
15,01When racism reigns, and nobody wins
15,01When people take that sort of mentality
15,01It's time to wake up... to Reality

15,01                  "Nope.. no cool colors this time..."
