15,01            12There was an unexpected wind14,
15,01            12a low whistle through the tower where we stood
15,01            12overlooking downtown among used rubbers14,
15,01            12the bitter glass of beer bottles14...
15,01            14& 12there were the dirty needles
15,01            12that give Worcester some metropolitan flavor14.

15,01            12You told me stories of this place14,
15,01            14& 12I was incredulous14. 12A lone tower on a hill14,
15,01            12someone14'12s dream materialized
15,01            12in the oddest contrapostal of place & time14.

15,01            12the kind of place that other people become obsessed with14;
15,01            12the kind of place that one person builds14,
15,01            12and we only visit after they die14.
