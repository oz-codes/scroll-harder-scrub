15,01Grace

15,01I saw your face, in the crowd
15,01with Mr. Mace, carrying a smile
15,01doesn't leave a trace, it ain't that loud
15,01so you've set your pace, you'll stay awhile

15,01you start to cry, for a long long while
15,01river flowing from an eye, you waste away
15,01soon to die, your life set on trial
15,01so start to lie, you'll stop the spray

15,01see this hand, on the edge of the ledge
15,01merging with the land, so very far below
15,01only in demand, by those who stuff the wedge
15,01on goes the sand, showing life what she'll know

15,01your name you sign, a dream now dried
15,01ready to serve a fine, for what who knows
15,01but I said it's mine, watch the sunnied blood
15,01a silent machine, slowly slowly it grows
