15,01no friction to stop it
15,01it justs keeps going and going

15,01people are outside my window
15,01and they are fighting
15,01over who has the right to fuck who
15,01and who can drink the most alcohol.

15,01people outside of my window
15,01and they are running around like rats
15,01in a maze of product trying to purchase the best
15,01while wasting their entire life in the process
