15,01                 13"I looked, and there was a pale green horse.
15,01                   13Its rider was named Death, and Hades
15,01                   13accompanied him. They were given authority
15,01                   13over the earth, to kill with sword, famine
15,01                   13and plague, and by all means of the beasts of
15,01                   13the earth."

15,01                    14Washed white in the blood of the innocent
15,01                      14The lost souls are crying in pain...
15,01                       14The vengeance of the lord is sent,
15,01               14The inhabitants of the earth are called by number,
15,01                                  14by name-

15,01                  14One by one the lamb breaks the seven seals,
15,01                14To judge the fate of mankind drowning in blood
15,01                                 14and tears,
15,01                      1424 elders before the lamb kneel,
15,01               14The rising dead, rivers blood red... what's left
15,01                              14for us to fear?-

15,01                 14Yet I say to you... the faithful sacrifice,
15,01                                 14Let's go...
15,01                 14To the throneroom, the endless banquet hall,
15,01                          14the promise is to suffice,
15,01                               14To end every woe-

15,01                        14Every Apocalypse is not an end,
15,01                            14It's a vision of hope...
15,01                      14For that tolling bell, do not send,
15,01                           14There isn't enough rope!-
