15,01                                 Changes To REM

15,01         Alright I hope that everyone took to the new change of REM iNC.
15,01       This month XGA has merged with the group.  Now we have some healthy
15,01     support down in the East Coast.  No more sites are wanted at this time,
15,01    unless you are a 100% grade A artboard and can provide your own courier.
15,01      We are now accepting donations of $10.00 or more, when requesting for
15,01      any type of artwork we currently support.  It is up to each artist to
15,01      give out their information to the requestee to get their hard earned
15,01      money.  As all members know, we will be regulating artwork.  We want
15,01       more recognition, attention, and quality artwork to get the public
15,01                       to notice us as a Top-Notch group.


15,01                              New Proposals To REM

15,01     For Static Net, Can anyone come up with a new ancronym and meaning to
15,01    replace Static Net, The reason why is because there is already a Static
15,01   Net around.  If it is not possible to come up with one, then we will just
15,01                              stick with STC Net.
15,01     All coders please report in so we can talk about this summers project.
15,01    Artists that did not contribute their artwork, or did not make the cut,
15,01                   your name will not be on the artists list.
15,01     A new revised version of the multi-viewer will be out next month.
15,01                   Talks of a bulletin board system for REM.
15,01     Damage Volume #1 is our music disk.  Separate from the art packet.
15,01                           Will be released bi-monthly.
