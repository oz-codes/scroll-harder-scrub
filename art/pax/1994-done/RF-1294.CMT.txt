15,01     Well, once again, our music totally rules this month.  Lapse
15,01is quickly becoming one of the premier music producers in the
15,01entire scene (ansi, music, demo, whatever!).  Be sure to catch
15,01all of the amazing yields of this month's musicians!  Game and
15,01Ghent have some impressive stuff, and Fizban joins us this month
15,01as a new musician.
15,01     Less ANSI than I had hoped this month, but what we do have
15,01rules.  My thanks go to DT, Waxman, Tae, and Ghent for helping us
15,01have something good to show for in this category.
15,01     VGA was, not surprisingly, slim this month with one AGSE
15,01from Pyro Maniac.  I personally would like to see a lot more VGA
15,01being produced (in Lapse and the whole scene), but I am very glad
15,01Pyro was able to get this creation in the pack.
15,01     As usual LapseView can be used to enjoy EVERY piece of
15,01artwork present in the Lapse packs and the latest version can be
15,01DCC'd from the bot inside the #Lapse channel or else FTP'd from
15,01xmission.com inside my directory /pub/users/redflame.
15,01     One last note: Tae left us for Shiver this month, but then
15,01fortunately came back to us.  *phew*  Welcome back, Tae!
