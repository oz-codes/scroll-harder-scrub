15,01                     Lapse August 1994 Information
15,01                     -----------------------------

15,01Another month has passed, and Lapse is chugging along at a respectable pace.
15,01As always, a few members have been gained and lost.  We were sorry to see
15,01Hellspawn and his expert ansi-drawing skills leave us; he is now a member of
15,01Tribe.  Good Luck, Hellspawn!

15,01One of the members we acquired this month is T/+E, and he'll be helping us out
15,01in the ansi department.  As you will notice, he is very productive, and has
15,01improved drastically just in the past month.  You should expect great things
15,01from him in the future.

15,01The viewer is faster and smoother than ever this month.  The Red Flame
15,01implemented hardware scrolling into it, and also added virus protection.
15,01As before, LapseView views ANSI in all screen modes up to 1024x768 with VESA,
15,01and also views AGSE, The Red Flame's own graphic standard.  AGSE emulates
15,01real graphics with binary codes, much like ANSI, providing for extremely fast,
15,01hi-resolution terminal emulation.  Unfortunately, our VGA department was weak
15,01this month, and you won't get to see much AGSE.  Look out for it in the
15,01future.

15,01Any way, there is some quality artwork in the pack from our artists, and
15,01Insanitor continues to pump out nice tunes in .S3M format.  Word has it that
15,01The Red Flame's next big addition to LapseView will be music-playing
15,01capabilities, but until then, I recommend PSI's Scream Tracker 3.01B to
15,01listen to Insanitor's and Game's music.

15,01One thing that needs to be clarified: Lapse is NOT accepting any more sites
15,01inside the continental-USA.  Until further notice, we'll be sticking with
15,01the sites and HQ's we have now.  We ARE, however, looking for talented,
15,01productive artists and musicians, so feel free to apply via our application
15,01generator.

15,01Things to look for in the near future of Lapse: First, a literature
15,01department.  We will probably be releasing separate bi-monthly lit packs
15,01hopefully starting with September.  Also, we have considered creating a
15,01small group of coders who will be coding PPE's for PCBoard BBS Software.
15,01Expect the final word on that next month. Ansi's using ExtendedColor a.k.a
15,01iCEColor will most likely be in the next pack..

15,01Until next month...

15,01  Well, as Delirium Tremens said.. we're sorry to see HellSpawn leave.. even
15,01for Tribe.. heh.. Anyway, we picked up T/+E and DeathWish.. both very 
15,01talented artists.. this month Phaser-X actually did something.. heh.. two
15,01logo's is all.. but still..
15,01  Also, since I'm mostly in charge of sites.. I'd like to re-emphasize that
15,01we are *not* taking anymore sites in the Continental US.. Meaning, if you're
15,01not in another country.. or in Hawaii or Alaska.. don't fucking bother.. heh.
15,01Not to mention, we hardly have any couriers.. (one.. and that's all) so, most
15,01of the distribution will be done through internet.. which is ten thousands
15,01times more effective in my opinion.. =)
15,01  Anyway, it's just been another one of those hectic months.. I did weed out
15,01the site list to all of my ability.. if you were taken from the site list the
15,01reasons are either..
15,01  a) You're position/hq was not needed.. and only cluttered up the site lists
15,01  b) I have not heard from you for quite some time
15,01If you've got a problem, or need to contact me.. I'm usually on irc in #ansi
15,01or #lapse.. or you can mail me at tkiller@xmission.com or even call my board
15,01Deadly Intoxication (801)553-8644..
15,01  This pack, I included the slime-net pack (Lapse's official net) so that 
15,01anyone who wishes to apply can fill out the application generator.. any 
15,01questions, comments, or requests can be sent to the address above..

15,01----------------------------------------------------------------------------

15,01  Well, we continue to go at it.. This month, we've improved the viewer,
15,01or more precisely, The Red Flame has improved the viewer.. We have a lot of
15,01new ANSI's, and a few new tunes.. Unfortunatly, our VGA department was weak
15,01this month, but you've already heard all that.. <g>
15,01  Since I'm mainly involved with the music, I'll concentrate on that.
