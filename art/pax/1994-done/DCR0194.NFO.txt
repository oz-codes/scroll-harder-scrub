15,01    
15,01Well, here it is: The very first (very small) -DcR- PACK!  This release has
15,01been promised now for 6 months, and it is FINALLY here.  Though it is small,
15,01I think it's a start.  When we come up with a few new VGA/ANSi artists, we
15,01can give you all some decent releases that can actually keep you busy for 
15,01more than five minutes.  

15,01We have a World Head Quarters (WHQ) now.  It will carry the newest releases
15,01and all earlier releases from -DcR-, so that currently will be the main
15,01distribution site as well.  The number for Alternative Nation, the WHQ, is
15,01at the bottom of this file.

15,01We have decided to draw ANSi for any BBS in need for a small fee.  We 
15,01guarentee satisfaction of quality ORIGINAL ANSi drawn specifically for your
15,01board.  We can draw multi-page logos, menu sets, or whatever else you need
15,01to make your board a more creative place.  If you are interested in -DcR-
15,01drawing your board ANSi, call Gatekeeper voice at 901-377-3471.  We can 
15,01talk price at that time.

15,01If you are interested in becoming a member of -DcR-, an artist of some type
15,01or a distribution site/courier, call the above number and we'll work out
15,01details.  

15,01Welp, looks like that's it!  Thanks for reading and remember:
