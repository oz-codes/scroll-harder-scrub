00,011: Lack of Viewer

00,01    Ok we said over and over again that we were waiting on the viewer and thats
00,01why the pack isn't out yet and now it comes out without a viewer. Seems like we
00,01were making excuses eh? Well heres the story. We had someone working on the
00,01viewer but due to circumstances he could not finish it. Now we could have had
00,01someone else make a viewer but it would have taken too long and it would have
00,01not been until Novemember until we released a pack. So we decided to release the
00,01pack without a viewer and see our response. The Second Wave of Pandemonium
00,01will have a viewer in it.

00,012: New Members

00,01    As you can tell by looking at our member list we do not have very many
00,01members. We are looking for new artists,writers,and coders. Just fill out the
00,01application generator and follow the directions it makes in the final
00,01application.

00,013: A Note From The Prez

00,01    Alright dudes, we are here to make art and though we've had several setbacks
00,01trying to get this first pack out, we have pulled through and done it. I would
00,01like to think the members of VOR who supported ROC and everyone else also.
00,01Everyone has been cool and made us feel welcome in the art scene. Look for some
00,01suprises in the next pack, like a viewer <g>. Well I guess thats it for this
00,01.NFO file. Maybe once we get goping a little stronger we'll have more to talk
00,01about.
