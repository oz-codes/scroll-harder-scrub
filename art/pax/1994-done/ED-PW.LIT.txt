15,01Unknown to you
15,01The power is within me
15,01The life is out
15,01But the rest is here

15,01I will come back
15,01And rise again
15,01Without you I am nothing
15,01With you I am no more

15,01I don't look for answers
15,01Just a smile and a hello
15,01I need that no more
15,01I can survive on my own
