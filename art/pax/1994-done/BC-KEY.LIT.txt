15,01have you ever unlocked a door just because of what it represented ?
15,01look at the door.. and think to yourself.. why should I let this barrier stand
15,01here ? what right do I have to use my authority (ownership of a key) to keep
15,01someone else from enjoying the space behind the door ?
15,01will they abuse my gift ?

15,01Jim Morrison named his band The Doors.

15,01The Doors of Perception.

15,01doors are quite an obvious metaphor you know and yet they don't seem too
15,01cliche. weird thought eh ?

15,01yeah.. I like keys. Keys are small metal pointy objects that I carry around and
15,01they are all different. In ghostbusters there was quite the sexual reference
15,01barrage when a man was deemed 'keymaster' and a woman was christened
15,01'gatekeeper'. If you look closely at keys you will notice that they are all
15,01different. Tiny locksmith's works of art really...  keys are like penises.. you
15,01can stick em all kinds of places and they'll fit but only in 1 lock will you be
15,01able to turn it and something special happens.
15,01right now I'm looking for one of those rare locks that I fit.

15,01I guess there are more people that you can fall in love with than locks a key
15,01will unlock. So the odds of finding someone who fits me are better than
15,01unlocking someone else's car with my key.

15,01Weird thought eh ?

15,01tiny locksmith's art pieces.
15,01totally underappreciated.
15,01subtle ringing sounds when they hit each other.
15,01babies like keys.
15,01they play with them..
15,01parents don't like keys.
15,01they lose them..

15,01computers have keys too you know..
15,01by phoning 241-8165 with your modem you are unlocking a door.
15,01notice the log on screen.

15,01weird how things all cycle.

15,01keys and meat's meaninglessness.
