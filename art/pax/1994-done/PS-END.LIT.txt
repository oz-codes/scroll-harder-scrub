15,01        Dancing in the darkness
15,01drenched in blood
15,01moonlight enveloping me
15,01invoking the sacred wrath
15,01observing all that is evil

15,01        Observe the end of time
15,01come rule with me
15,01selling your soul for death
15,01cruciform hills--beckon thee
15,01call upon your inner strength

15,01        Strength unknown grips me        
15,01growing into God        
15,01feeling power beyond human life
15,01sate the beast of time forgotten
15,01bring me my sacrifice
15,01save yourself from eternal damnation

15,01       Damntion is the future
15,01cry not for the dead
15,01of them you shall soon be one
15,01listen to my lies and hear the truth
15,01the end has almost come
15,01i will give you life beyond life

15,01       Life fades away
15,01mountains of bodies
15,01littering fields with human trash
15,01your deity attempts to stop me
15,01universe dies when powers clash
15,01the end is nigh

15,01       End comes and planets crumble
15,01no lord passes my hate
15,01looking over the barren lands
15,01laughing at the death and destruction
15,01that was caused by my hands       
15,01the end has come


15,01The End Has Come
