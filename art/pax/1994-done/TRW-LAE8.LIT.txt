15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        Golgotha drew an over-sized period on the paper and slammed his pencil
15,01down on the table triumphantly.
15,01        "Whew!" he said and smiled broadly. He flipped through the small stack
15,01of paper that he had just finished writing on and grabbed an unopened can of
15,01beer before slouching back in his chair. He popped the tab with his thumb,
15,01took a swig and said "Gentlemen, I think we can do this."
15,01        Dennis looked over the list of equipment that he had compiled according
15,01to the NEB's plan. "It may take a few days to find all this stuff, you
15,01know."
15,01        Golgotha paused in his chugging and replied "If Steve's still alive
15,01right now, he should still be alive in a few days or even a week. You see,
15,01if Aurora wants him to narc, they'd have to match his info with what they
15,01already know and then devise a plan of their own to hit us. If they want
15,01some of his designs, likewise, they'd have to make sure that it works before
15,01they kill him. If they're going to do experiments on him, then he'd
15,01definitely still be alive by the time we get there. I've never heard of any
15,01experiments that didn't take at least a month to complete, especially one
15,01that had a specific guinea pig."
15,01        Dennis gave a little shrug and nodded.
15,01        "But we should get in there within the next three days," Golgotha
15,01added. "After that, there's no telling what they would have done to him. He
15,01may not be worth saving." 
15,01        Forbidden Image stared off into space through a small cloud of multi-
15,01coloured sparks of his own creation which buzzed about his head like
15,01fireflies from out of a hippie nightmare. "Not worth saving..." he muttered
15,01and shook his head.
15,01        Golgotha cast a glance over and casually finished off his beer. "Okay,
15,01let's get the fuck out of here and get all our shit together." He picked up
15,01all his empty beer cans and got up to throw them out.
15,01        As the last one dropped into the aluminum trash can, a sound made
15,01Golgotha freeze. The lock on the front door began to turn.
15,01        The four exchanged glances between them and they all drew out their
15,01weapons and stared intently at the door.
15,01        It unlocked and swung open and Karen stood in the doorway with her eyes
15,01wide and her mouth gaping. Her purse dropped to the floor.
15,01        Golgotha gave an exasperated sigh and shoved his gun back into its
15,01holster. "Christ, Karen, what are you doing here?"
15,01        She retrieved her purse and shuffled into the lighthouse, looking
15,01desperate and angry. "What am I doing here?" she repeated with her eyebrows
15,01knitted. "What YOU GUYS doing here?! And where's Steve? He didn't call me
15,01last night."
15,01        No one answered her question which made her even more nervous than she
15,01was originally. She shouted Elminster's name but was met with nothing but
15,01the hollow echo of her voice as her call bounced off the thick cement walls.
15,01        "You should go home," Golgotha said softly. "You and Steve might both
15,01still be in danger."
15,01        She looked at him and tears began to creep into her eyes. "Jay
15,01Golgotha, you're a lying son of a bitch," she scolded and fought back a
15,01series of sobs.
15,01        He looked back at her calmly but remained silent.
15,01        "They got him didn't they?" she asked in a rasping whisper. A tear ran
15,01down from the corner of her eye, past her nose and settled at the corner of
15,01her mouth where it stayed, quivering like a wet puppy.
15,01        Golgotha opened his mouth ready to say something but Karen stopped him.
15,01        "Don't try to lie to me, Jay," she warned him. "I think I've already
15,01figured out pretty much what's going on. In a nutshell, they've got him and
15,01you guys are going to bust him out, right?"
15,01        Golgotha considered denying her assumption for a second but decided
15,01against it. "Pretty much," he said. "How'd you know?"
15,01        "Look at yourselves!" she exclaimed. "It doesn't take a genius to
15,01figure out why you guys are so goddam tense."
15,01        Golgotha saw the look in Karen's eyes change from a weepy frightened
15,01one to one that was passionate and full of rage and fury. He recognized it;
15,01it was the infant stage of a mad mind. People who had that gleam in their
15,01eyes more often than not went off soon after and did something drastic,
15,01something that they wouldn't usually DREAM of doing. And in her case, he had
15,01a pretty good idea what that something would be.
15,01        "If you're thinking of getting in on the rescue, forget it," he said
15,01firmly. "The bust is far too risky. Steve's in the RDC on the lake. If we
15,01let you come with us, he'd shoot all of us dead as soon as his feet touched
15,01shore."
15,01        "Are you insane?" Karen asked, taken aback. "Or do you think I'M
15,01insane? I've never fired a gun in my life, let alone kill someone. What good
15,01would I be to you guys other than to be a human shield? I just want to see
