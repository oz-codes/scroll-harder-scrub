02,01E12m15p00ire Monthly News Update for the date of 01/0115/129024 00-----13-00-13--00--13-00-13---06-13-06-13--06-13-06--13-06--

06,01   14Okay... Time for the Monthly News Flash. Here's what's happening in Empire...

00,01#    11Having taken our internal restructuring efforts into the month of December,
11,01  our group has now taken a turn toward  the  better . This month, we acquired a
11,01  few new members, including new positions  for   West Coast, the United States,
11,01  and the World Coordinators.  Their efforts make the politics of the group more
11,01  stable and secure,  as well as spread the group's packs into Australia, Europe
11,01  and any number of  other  places as  well.  We see  European  sites,  HQs, and
11,01  artists in our future... and we have already expanded into  Australia, picking
11,01  up Flick as an artist, and Violent Crimes as our Australian HQ  along the  way
11,01  I truly believe that within 3  months,  this  group  will  be  a  considerable
11,01  alternative to ACiD or iCE, without as much of the  competition  and pressure.
11,01  This was one of my major long term  goals  in the creation of Empire, and  I'm
11,01  proud to say that soon that goal may be achieved. I'd like to take this  space
11,01  to thank Dark Vision, Shadow Hawk, Night Crawler, Flick, and Sudden Death  for
11,01  their contributions in this matter.

00,01#    11With the crippling retirement of Killraven, and the end of the year, come
11,01  the end of the short age or Empire's birth. This event has saddened us all,
11,01  but we continue on into the next year. With the death of our first age (I call
11,01  it this because I cannot call it a year, and this year having passed marks a
11,01  turn in Empire's history... therefore I refer to it as an 'age'), comes the
11,01  beginning of our next 'age', ushering in a relative prosperity in the group.
11,01  In October of '93, we set out with big plans to become a respected group, but
11,01  without becoming media slaves in the process. We have taken a large step in
11,01  that direction with the first three months of our existence, and ahead of us
11,01  seems to lie a stable future, filled with much more prosperity. With the
11,01  retirement of Killraven we have the recruitment of many great artists. There
11,01  are so many artists now in Empire, I can not and will not name them all. I
11,01  don't put any of them above the other, so I never express my favorite...
11,01  besides... they know. ;)

00,01#    11EmpireNet was a codename for the net which was to be born hosting Empire.
11,01  That name has now been officially set to ConquestNet. However, ConquestNet is
11,01  now no longer ready for applicants from the United States. We are in a testing
11,01  stage and plan to carry boards in Australia and Europe, and are accepting only
11,01  their applications at this time. Sorry if it disappoints you.

00,01#    11Premier Magazine continues production. Artists and coders are hard at work
11,01  getting the interface together, but we are not accepting articles or writers
11,01  until we have finished the coding and art for the magazine. We were unable to
11,01  release a demo this month, due to the Christmas Events eating up our time.
11,01  We predict a release sometime in March, but we still refuse to set a hard
11,01  date.


11,01   14That's the news for January 1st, 1994... Stay tuned: more news at eleven...
