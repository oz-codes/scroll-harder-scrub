15,01Beauty To The Beholder

15,01        The eternal deepness of your eyes, represent to me the skies;
15,01        Skies of blues, ambers, violets, fires and jades.
15,01        The vast expansive endless skies, in which the eagle soars and flies
15,01--Soars up high and never dies

15,01The infinite flowing of your hair, forbodes a warning that I dare-
15,01Dare not ever touch your hair;
15,01The threads of gold that wave in air; waving slowly, yet so fair.
15,01--Wave throughout in ways so rare

15,01        The subtle revelance of your smile, suggests a love that can't defile;
15,01        Rendering, returning, rare radiant renditions of love.
15,01        A smile that chills me all the while,
15,01--Makes me glad I am Virile

15,01One thought of you words cannot write, although I try with all my might
15,01Tripping through trials not many mortal men have trod before.
15,01Eagerly I wish for light, and in vain I'll fight the fight
15,01--To win your heart is only right

15,01        There alone I see you sitting; Alone! Alone! It is not fitting!
15,01        As if there ought to be a need to be with someone-
15,01        With someone else to be there sitting, to sit by you in love emitting
15,01--I'll sit with you! All submitting.
