15,01         Hey, mr. corruption here.. and I got some shit I need to say..
15,01First off, I wanna give some info on why i quit Havok Enterprizes after the
15,01month of May.. There were deffinetly some mis-understandings about the
15,01iLLUSiON - Havok Merger.. and all iLLUSiON members were made to think that
15,01Havok was coming to us.. which, in fact, they were.. but after a few weeks,
15,01Havok made it obvious that they had other plans in mind the whole time.. and
15,01instead of Myself and Azrael being in charge.. it was obvious that Lars Ulrich
15,01had decided to just take us in as regular artists.. which WASNT what was agreed
15,01to.. well after a few more "unreasonable" occurances, I decided to get Azrael,
15,01and the rest of the iLLUSiON members back together, and start off where we were
15,01in the beginning of may.. iLLUSiON changing our name to FURY, and going from
15,01there.. and we picked up some more coders.. and an artist, then one of our
15,01ansi artists switched to coding.. and well *WAS* working on the application, but

15,01his father decided that they should all go to poland.. <shrug> oh well, look for

15,01the FURY App Gen in the month of August.. anyway, there are some people I would
15,01like to greet, thank, mumble senseless shit to, so here it goes..

15,01Azrael: May I please have a rip? its all I ask for in life..
15,01Wiz: Hey, get in this line.. theres that chick..
15,01blurr: 139.78.33.63   You figure it out..
15,01DeathMonger: Where are those pictures of your 14 Year old sister taking a
15,01         shower, that you promised me?
15,01Typhoon: Wow, you are only what? 10 hours late?
15,01Jello: Uh.. Hi.. I am still not on Programmed illusion, or chasm of doom! :)
15,01Flood: I owe you $20.. please finish my ansi..
15,01ACiD VMB d0oDz: Hey, this is illie kahmahl, and one of your boys touched me on
15,01         my pants, where no man should be touching me.. (hope you liked that)
15,01ECLiPSE: Uh, you guys make PtK/TEC look DAMN good..
