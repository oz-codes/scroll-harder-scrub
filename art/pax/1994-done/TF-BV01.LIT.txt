14,01  A land surpast sight, A land beyond Life. Where the Blind are respected and
15,01                    14cherished without eyes, without sight...
15,01            14To Achive this Destiny we must voyage far and then some.
15,01                 14Past the speed of light; As acute as it sounds
15,01        14The sounds fade as we move past mach 1, then mach 4 and mach 5.
14,01   Going faster and fa00ster the light dims away till i14t vanishes from around;
14,01 Yet he does not no00tice in the state he is in without si14ght he is lost, whether
14,01 it exists or n00o more. At thi02s speed all is fin00e, but for how14long we know not.

15,01      14No voices no nois00es, just the silence above we a14re lost beyond hope.
14,01But it is peaceful and quite non-the-less.  No visions to disrupt us, no sights
