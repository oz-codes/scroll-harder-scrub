15,01This is the first thing I've ever done for Breed.
15,01It's Red and it plays a MOD that we didn't write.

15,01If it doesn't work on your computer, well, you probably don't have a very good
15,01computer now do you.... That or I suck.. Either is possible..

15,01The whole thing is really just a horrible palette trick. If you don't have
15,01a fast VGA card, you're not going to really experience the true redness of it
15,01all.
