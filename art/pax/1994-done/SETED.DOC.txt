15,01INTRODUCTION
15,01------------
15,01The Docs for version 3.0 Beta where kinda thrown together cause I wanted
15,01to get it out to the public by January 1st. If you have ever installed
15,01a PPE before you shouldn't have a problem..

15,01DESCRIPTION
15,01-----------
15,01SETED.PPE was developed in order to make it a little less confusing when a
15,01user wants to change any of his settings with the W command. SETED displays
15,01a Menu of the options to the user instead of prompting him through a dozen
15,01or so questions.

15,01FEATURES
15,01--------
15,01SETED can now be fully customized by the Sysop. All Colors, Prompts,
15,01Questions and Screens can be edited by the sysop via configuration files.

15,01Auto Detection of ALIAS and ADDRESS Psa's.

15,01Support for Multi Language versions of the Prompt and Question Data files.
