15,01                                 WHO'S  THE  STUPID  ONE??

15,01        "This is so fake!" complained the student as the small books were
15,01distributed to the other classmates. She sighed heavily, to let everyone know
15,01just how stupid she thought the books were. The girl next to her, old
15,01Star-Dreamer, accepted her book as if it were a precious artifact.

15,01        "All you read here is fake, Star-Dreamer!" she hissed. Maybe the girl
15,01liked being called Star-Dreamer, maybe she didn't, but she accepted the name
15,01without arguing.

15,01        "All I ask is that you leave me to immerse myself in the truth,
15,01Land-Queen."

15,01        Land-Queen scoffed at her nickname. "Land-Queen, indeed. I do not
15,01believe silly fantasies of our future."

15,01        "All is probable, all is possible. By closing your mind to space, you
15,01chain yourself here. Yours is a closed future." Star-Dreamer always spoke in
15,01riddles.

15,01        Land-Queen was about to reply, but the teacher interrupted by asking
15,01them all to turn to page one. Silently, each student read the short story to
15,01themselves. Land-Queen heard the gasps as the climax was introduced, gasps from
15,01all but Star-Dreamer, whose eyes sparkled with an untold secret. Only
15,01Star-Dreamer could enjoy these... these... hasteful, suspicious, phoney
15,01stories.

15,01        The teacher was waiting. Land-Queen surveyed the room; everyone had
15,01finished reading. "What did you think?" she asked. Land-Queen and Star-Dreamer
15,01were the first to stick their hands up. The class shifted restlessly; the
15,01debate between the two happened every class. They would not get a chance to
15,01speak. "Lizzie?" asked the teacher. Land-Queen smirked at Star-Dreamer. 

15,01        "I thought the story was dumb," she said. There was a murmer of
15,01agreement and some nodding of heads. Star-Dreamer didn't look upset. "I mean,"
15,01continued Lizzie, "let's consider our planet's history. We were a small,
15,01backwater planet, before the Revolution. They saved us. They took our little
15,01planet, and They helped us all evolve. Without Them, we'd be lost sheep,
15,01unimportant and alone."

15,01        "I think we all agree with you there," said the teacher, ignoring
15,01Star-Dreamer's frown. "So how does this tie in with the story?"

15,01        "Well, the story was making Them out to be the bad ones. It was as if
15,01They stole our planet, instead of helping us revolutionize it. I think the
15,01author was a foolish one, to write this. They wouldn't be pleased with him. We
15,01should be thankful for Them, and never turn against Them. They know best; Their
15,01race is older and wiser than us. And They can travel through the stars!" The
15,01impact of that last sentence reminded everyone of the power of the
15,01Revolutionizers. They could travel in space. The class was silent, marvelling
15,01at the idea.

15,01        "Dlakora?" sighed the teacher. Star-Dreamer accpeted the teacher's
15,01disdainful pronunciation of her name. She stood and addressed the class with
15,01an air of calm reserved only for those with understanding.

15,01        "The story was correct. " She said it factually, as if there could be
15,01no doubt. "My name is of our people, not Them. They stole our planet, and
15,01forced us to be like Them. Why couldn't we keep the Old Ways? We dress as They
15,01do, we speak as They do; in all ways save one we are the same. The difference
15,01is not in looks, as many of you think, but in respect. We view Them as gods;
15,01They view us as peasants. They have invaded our world, stolen our culture, and
15,01replaced it with Their own. I know the Old Ways," she said, in a moment of
15,01strength. The teacher looked sick.

15,01        "Dlakora, the Old Ways are forbidden. They said that they would ruin
15,01our civilization."

15,01        "They don't let us know our own world!" said Dlakoa, passionately. She
15,01looked rather desparately around the class, but was met only with blank stares.
15,01"They came here a century ago, and brought Their cultures with them. They stole
15,01our books, taking them back to Their world as treasures. They changed us, to
15,01be like them. We are Their grateful slaves; a whole world of willing slaves!
15,01Just because They have more technology, we bow to Them. They say they are our
15,01friends, yet forbid us to read of our world, or learn their technology. We are
15,01not even allowed to say Their name!"

15,01        "That's enough, Dlakora. We are not slaves, we are free servers,
15,01assistants. We help them revolutionize our world," spurted the teacher.
