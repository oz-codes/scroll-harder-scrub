15,01                12A tear makes it's way down her cheek.
15,01                12The only evidence of her pain.
15,01                12Her heart beats loud and steady
15,01                12With the rythm of the rain.
15,01                12His words echo ring and echo
15,01                12Like the pounding in her head.
15,01                12When he said goodbye,
15,01                12She suddenly wished that she was dead.

15,01                02The tear strikes lightly
15,01                02As it falls upon her hand.
15,01                02Her life has grown so empty
15,01                02Like an hourglass without sand.
15,01                02The ache is eminating
15,01                02Fron the hollowness of her soul.
15,01                02She walks the road to nowhere,
15,01                02And her heart has paid the toll.

15,01                14She wipes away all traces
15,01                14Of the solitary tear.
15,01                14She will not let anyone
15,01                14Know that it was here.
15,01                14She hides away the pain
15,01                14Down in the recesses of her heart.
15,01                14Where it will burn and fester,
15,01                14Slowly tearing her apart.
