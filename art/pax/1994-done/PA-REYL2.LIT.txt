15,01     The Great Emmissary sat shivering inside his meager living
15,01space.  It bothered hom little though.  As a boy Gregory Tramme
15,01had sat through weeks of hunger and years without heat.  At least
15,01now what his situation was lacking in life's physical nessecities
15,01it was more then plentiful with the supreme commandive power that
15,01he craved.  
15,01     The Reylerian cult was now based out of a small bulding in
15,01northern Colorado.  It was the least liely sight for a religious
15,01shrine.  The wood of the stairs was rotting; the dull gray stone
15,01walls were chipped away at, leaving a layer of jagged points that
15,01would cut anyone who dared to lean on them.  Compared to the rest
15,01of the space the Emmissary's room, little more then a stone box
15,01with a door and one small widow, was a paradise.  The only
15,01remarkable thing about the place was that above every door was
15,01the symbol of the cult, a black circle with a fanged, red grin.
15,01     The Emmissary had spent several months attempting to find a
15,01more permanent base of operations the the mobile wagons that the
15,01group had used before.  This was for two reasons.  The first
15,01being that the group had grown more rapidly then he could have
15,01hoped ofr, and thus there was no more real need to travel around
15,01and gain members.  The second was so as to appear to the other
15,01members that the cult had taken a step toward true religious
15,01organization, something that would make him look more powerful in
15,01their eyes.  
15,01     As Great Emmisary he performed his duties always without
15,01failure.  He knew that anything but perfect praticing of the
15,01cult's customs would endanger his position.  He allowed no
15,01apprentices, remebering what he had done to the fool who had let
15,01him be one.   He knew that now that the group was setteld though
15,01that simply perfoming the necessayr actions of the cult's
15,01religion would not be enough.  He had to make it seem as if he
15,01was being a very productive leader.  
15,01     He became so  engrossed in his position that he even started
15,01dreaming of Reyler.  The odd being's form, both demonic and
15,01divine simultaneously, was an amazing sight.  Reyler spoke to him
15,01and told him of a great High Council that dictated the fate of
15,01multiple universes.  He spoke of his attempts to rise to power in
15,01the council, and of how he would lead mankind (or what was left
15,01of it once he was done), with Tramme at his side, to the conquer
15,01an infinite number of universes.  
15,01     He once spoke of these odd dreams, which he thought to be
15,01nothng more then a result of his work with such religious
15,01fanatics, to one of his followers.  Of course this man, whose
15,01name was Brian Drelman, took this to be a true sign form his god. 
15,01He encouraged the Emmisarry to write them down as the holy
15,01scriptures of Reyler.  Realizing that this may be the
15,01productivity that his poeple desired Tramme began to spend hours
15,01writing down the words that came to him in dreams form a god who
15,01he did not really believe in.  It did not matter to Tramme.  All
15,01that he cared about was that he was getting more and more control
15,01over more and more followers, the exact thing that the god he
15,01claimed to be the voice of wanted.

15,01                                    V.

15,01     Reyler's position had gone up in his time on the council. 
15,01His speech on behalf of Trillyw had brought the two closer
15,01together then he had hoped.  The sly ex-demon knew he gave the
15,01feelings that dictated Trillyw's actions a logical base,
15,01something that the old god found indispensible.  From the moment
15,01of the speech on Trillyw would not atend any sort of Council
15,01function without the presecnce of Reyler. 
15,01     Reyler was still watched carefully by other Council members
15,01though.  While his support had gone up with tose who were
15,01traditional freinds with Trillyw he was still lacking athe
15,01backing of the most important Council member, Querom.  
15,01     Querom was a middle aged council member who had risen from
15,01mortal status, the most impressive rise in the history of the
15,01universes.  It was said that even without omniscience he was able
15,01to outsmart the ecil old god of his universe into giving up the
15,01position and naming him the heir.  Querom prized nothing more
15,01then ability.  He was considered by most the most adept god in
15,01any situation.  He never lied, never cheated and never did
15,01anything concealed from the others.  It was this quality that
15,01scared Reyler.  
15,01     Reyler's life as a demon was filled with trickery and
15,01deciet. It was the only way to gain power.  Those who could keep
