00,01you've sat around
00,01high on yourself
00,01one day i'll knock you the fuck down
00,01feeding on the grief of others
00,01don't deny it
00,01cower in fear, 
00,01try to run,
00,01your hatred grows
00,01penetration.
00,01near-death
00,01and then you heal, 
00,01in some jail 
00,01i've felt it for eternity  
00,01foreign substance enters,
00,01intermingles,
00,01makeshift fantasies can't heal you now
00,01taste agony
00,01roll around in it.
00,01let your skin absorb it
00,01mercy?
00,01nah,
00,01i'll fuck with your mind
00,01then, let you die like a bitch
00,01former images of yourself,
00,01fade
00,01only hollow images of the past
00,01remain
00,01how does it feel?
