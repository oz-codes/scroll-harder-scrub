00,01Try to find hope in despair
00,01Look for a savior in the next man
00,01I plead you pass my stair
00,01Lay no ill finger on my land
00,01You come to seek your king
00,01Yet will choose what you find
00,01I will watch you choose anything
00,01And weep as your land is laid behind
00,01A new day has come
00,01But not glorious in it's midst
00,01Find your own, I stay lonesome
00,01Happy in my listlessness
00,01Find you all to be ill of health
00,01He turns on you and you pray
00,01Yet you are blind to yourself
00,01And then you call my mind of heresay
00,01Yet you cannot hope to see what I do
00,01Nor see what I see in life
00,01For found in me is lost in you
00,01You will find eternal strife
00,01I tire quickly of your rules
00,01I will not play your game
00,01There is no life in your pools
00,01Your useless minds stay the same...
