15,01Brain Rot.

15,01in a snap I broke in two
15,01mindless waste a part of you
15,01trapped inside i'm scared of you
15,01demon child born by who

15,01mother gone yet found again
15,01sinner of sins commited when
15,01droubt caused by a demonic hen
15,01ironic a little but lost again

15,01a verse or two lost then found
15,01caught by the voidless ground
15,01never a word never a sound
15,01when i drop then pin on the mound

15,01so little to late not near enough
15,01all i heard was this sad sad bluff
15,01until reality showed me enough
15,01i was a king but had no stuff

15,01a leader among leaders climber ontop
15,01one of a kind nothing like a cop
15,01i fed you this sludge-like slop
15,01you wouldnt even touch it with a mop

15,01so in your mind you feel the rot
15,01deep inside your brains empty lot
15,01vacant unfilled waiting spot
15,01yearning for knowledge not pot
