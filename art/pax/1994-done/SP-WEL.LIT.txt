15,01A single mother and her son go off to the
15,01        local welfare service
15,01They stand behind many others with
15,01        many other problems
15,01Some alike, some not, yet all are in trouble
15,01        Or are they?
15,01Look ahead, just a few spots, at that woman
15,01        Is that a leather jacket?
15,01And further up the line - a man jumping in line
15,01        but with no proof of deserving it
15,01Not this poor mother and her son
15,01        They are truly in trouble
15,01Her husband died a few months back
15,01        leaving them with no income
15,01Putting them on the streets, homeless
15,01        with no help except the local shelters
15,01And as her son looks ahead, he sees the people
15,01        who are stealing from the system
15,01A young boy of only 8, yet he asks
15,01        "Mom, why do they steal?"
15,01And she can not help but respond, with a look of sorrow on her face
15,01        "Because nobody will stop them."
