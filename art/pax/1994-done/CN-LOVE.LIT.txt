15,01worship, before the one you love,
15,01as her voice comes down, from above.
15,01she has never really spoken to you,
15,01and still you know your love is true.
15,01her looks, her acts, her voice, her words,
15,01life you higher, than any birds.
15,01yet she has a boyfriend, the jock little prick,
15,01how can he worship with a skull so thick?
15,01you call her, for her 'hello',
15,01and light breath as you burn below.
15,01and still, how can, she not see,
15,01the love that burns inside of me?
