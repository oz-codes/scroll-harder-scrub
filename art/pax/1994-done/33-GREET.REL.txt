15,01killer greets. december 1994. merry christmas. happy new year. bitch.

15,01"relish, onion, the scene is like a big hot-dog"

15,01i love how there's a real significance in "union productions". at first 
15,01what i thought was that "production" didn't mean a thing. it's not true. 
15,01you want to know why union kick so much ass these days? that's becuz it's 
15,01run like a machine. you thought it was a myth, it's not. i'm sure ice and 
15,01acid is less "machine-like" than union.

15,01that's ok, tho'. i've no problem with machines. actually i have one 
15,01machine, i'm using it to write this. machines are fun, they never make any 
15,01mistakes.

15,01actually there's one thing where it's buggin. remember the union newsletter 
15,01in the 12/94 pack, where neurotic says that it's stupid that groups rag on 
15,01the dual-grouping artist cuz he didn't give them his best pic of the month, 
15,01or because he doesn't produce zillions of pics a month, etc. i agree 100% 
15,01with that nc dude. but now, there's still a problem.

15,01(for those who dunno, i joined union, btw. as a 2nd group. just for the 
15,01fuck of it. thankchew.)

15,01ok, so. i was on irc the other day, telling md that i would stay in relic 
15,01but i'd still wish to do stuff for union. he said it's ok, as long as union 
15,01gets the first pick. huh? i asked him some explanations, he said something 
15,01like "we'll look at your work every month and choose what we want in 
15,01union."

15,01AAAAAARGH. at first i didn't react. i said i would give them pics of equal 
15,01quality as relic pics anyway, so they don't have to choose. (kinda 
15,01obvious.. i'd do this wether asked or not, really..) he said okay. but he 
15,01really sounded like i give THE best to union, and keep the shit for relic. 
15,01i dunno what to think now. maybe i misinterpreted what he said.

15,01but don't worry, i won't give shit to relic. i'm still a relic dude before 
15,01being a union gearing.

15,01bah, who cares.

15,01oh, the greets.

15,01err.. i dunno. merry christmas to everyone. and happy new year, and all the 
15,01stuff you say so you don't look too weird.

15,01if you want an ansi, call my board, sarcastic toaster 418 849 0121. price 
15,01is 15 bucks. or if you are half-decent in ansi we can maybe trade. if you 
15,01can courier packs to my board too, i'd be glad to do an ansi. etc, etc, 
15,01etc. sorry for charging, it's the only way i can pay my 300$ ld bill. 
15,01thankchew.

15,01(oh. you can also find me on eye are see. yea, that foolio _33, thats ME!)
