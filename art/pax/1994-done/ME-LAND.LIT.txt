00,01Shadows gather round her a14s 00she wanders in the night
00,01As she hears a sound, she cannot help but fright
00,01And to her l14e00ft she turns afraid of what she'll see
00,01But nothing is there to gr14e00et her, just a lonely tree
00,01Another st14e00p, another noise
00,01She cries out and hears ano14t00her voice
00,01It could be 14a00n illusion and it could be mirror
00,01She touches herself a14n00d the pain sears
00,01B14l00ood runs over her arm, self-inflicated pain
00,01No more touching, she thinks shes gone ins14a00ne
00,01Stan14d 00still young lady and don't make a move
00,01Or you'll get yourself o14u00t of your own l14i00ttle cove
00,01Another s14t00ep, yet another noise
00,01Different than the first yet not with14o00ut its joys
00,01Agonizingly l14o00ud and the eardrums have broken
00,01What a beautif14u00l last note to hear unspoken
00,01She reaches for her ear and feels it fall off in her hand
00,01As she st14a00nds and crys a14c00id tears, s14h00e's reached a promised land
