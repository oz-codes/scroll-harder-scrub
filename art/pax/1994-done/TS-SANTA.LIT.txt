15,01                           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

15,01Blood-red suit and black leather boots,
15,01Jolly St. Nick dons his cap,
15,01Climbs aboard his magic slay,
15,01And gives that whip a crack.

15,01They say the old man's lost his mind,
15,01They say he's lost his head,
15,01But two thousand years'll do that to ya,
15,01If yer not already dead.

15,01With an evil grin and a 'Ho! Ho! Hell!',
15,01He tears across the sky,
15,01A streak of fire follows in his path,
15,01Yet onward his paindeer fly.

15,01The sled is loaded down with toys,
15,01And Santa's favorite kind,
15,01They all say 'Battery Included',
15,01He'll beat those fuckers blind.

15,01Below there lays a sleepy town,
15,01The evil slay descends,
15,01And crashes through a snow-covered roof,
15,01'Fuck this chimney shit' he says.

15,01Over to the stockings now,
15,01As quiet as can be,
15,01'Two worms for Jimmy, snails for Sally,
15,01And an ice-cold Bud for me!'

15,01When from behind there comes a voice,
15,01'Santa, is it you?'
15,01'Yes, Jimmy, but hmmm... you're on the bad-boy's list'
15,01And he tore that kid in two.

15,01Carefully he tiptoes now,
15,01And leaves the presents by the tree,
15,01Slowly, gently, without a sound,
15,01Dynamite's dangerous, you see.

15,01Now onward to the next victims,
15,01Er... "family", I mean,
15,01And so the jolly man goes on,
15,01Giving presents, getting screams.

15,01Perhaps his childhood was a little rough,
15,01He needs a bit of help,
15,01Or maybe he's just a fucking nut,
15,01Who's gonna burn in hell.

15,01Either way -- Christmas passed,
15,01With fewer problems than it would seem,
15,01Although Mrs. Jones could swear she fucked Santa Claus,
15,01But it must have been a dream.
