15,01affairs of life

15,01this is the land of hidden snares
15,01traps laid by my despair
15,01but all i can say is who fucking cares
15,01my life is an inner city affair

15,01i've been trapped and i've been scared
15,01asked a stranger why'd i think he care
15,01for the things i've wished and dared
15,01i'm still in my silent affair

15,01found myself in a dream
15,01couldn't find myself anywhere
15,01this is saner than is does seem
15,01but all i could grasp was empty air

15,01the darkness surrounds choking me
15,01fallen through the open tear
15,01floating into my self made obscurity
15,01maybe just maybe i'll see you there

15,01cause we all gotta be what we gotta be
15,01and we all gotta how that we can take this dare
15,01for if ya cant you've faked the insanity
15,01of my personal inner-city affair

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
