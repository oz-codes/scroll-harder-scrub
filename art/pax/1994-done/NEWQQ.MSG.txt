15,01            *9I understand fully that no mail is truly "Private", and
15,01            *9the sysop is legally allowed to read all private E-Mail
15,01            *9at his leisure.  I understand that the most likely, the
15,01            *9only reason he will read private E-Mail is if he recieves
15,01            *9a racial/sexual harassment complaint between two other
15,01            *9users.

15,01            *9I understand that no file on this system is guaranteed to

15,01            *9drive is damaged because of a file recieved on this BBS,
15,01            *9the sysop is in no way liable, even though he goes
15,01            *9through great pains to be sure that each file is virus-
15,01            *9free and not corrupted.
