15,01        "Who's the new player?" buzzed Bottle Rocket through the radio.
15,01        Sifton IDed the driver of the Lexus in his helmet and read off what was
15,01printed across the visor:

15,01        "Dennis Sanderson eh?" said Bottle Rocket and laughed an amused laugh.
15,01"A live-fast-die-a-sinned-soul type of guy. Sounds like he and I could be
15,01friends."
15,01        "Should we try to take him too?" Sifton asked. "The suits would
15,01probably boost our pay if we can take him back breathing. He must have a
15,01RoloDex full of underground connections."
15,01        Bottle Rocket considered it for a moment then answered "If the targets
15,01stay together, then you nail Sanderson. We'll take the other two. If they
15,01split up, we'll go with the original plan and then get him if it's
15,01convenient." 
15,01        "Affirmative," Sifton said and set the radio receiver down.
15,01        Another man got out of the Lexus carrying ordinance and armour which he
15,01handed to Elminster.
15,01        "Oh shit," Kosk muttered and shifted the Coda in his lap.
15,01        Picking up the radio again, Sifton announced "I don't know if the rest
15,01of you guys saw that but Primary's armed."
15,01        Both Bottle Rocket and Fire Wheel responded promptly, saying that they
15,01did see but it didn't matter.
15,01        After a brief shouting conversation between Karen and Elminster, the
15,01former climbed into the car as did Sanderson.
15,01        "This is Bottle Rocket. Modifications to plan B: Black Cat, follow them
15,01and bring James back alive at all costs. Also, capture Sanderson if
15,01possible, kill him if necessary."
15,01        "Wilco," replied Sifton and started the engine and drove off, seven
15,01car-lengths behind his quarry.

15,01        Michael Raines sat astride the black Yamaha Genesis 12, a newly
15,01designed motorcycle built with corporate Manhunters in mind.
15,01        Aurora bought three dozen of the bikes from Mirai Technologies, one of
15,01the three dominant companies in Japan. In total, the bill came to a cool $72
15,01million, each Genesis costing an even $2 mill and, in the minds of those
15,01paying, worth every penny. A few of the features that the bikes had which
15,01constituted such a high price included a new and improved race engine with a
15,01secondary booster to give it an incredible rate of acceleration; magnetized
15,01steering so that the driver could release the handle bars and drive with no
15,01hands for a few minutes; and hardened steel body with 48-layer Kevlar
15,01overlay that made the Genesis invulnerable to all but the biggest, meanest
15,01rounds on the market. There were many other little features that filled the
15,01600 page user's manual, but the aforementioned were the main topics of
15,01conversation.
15,01        The Fire Wheel unit consisted of four of the local division's best
15,01marksmen, two per bike. Raines drove lead with John Wilkens, Fire Wheel unit
15,01leader riding with him.
15,01        "Fire Wheel, eliminate Elminster's escort and sheepdog him towards the
15,01target zone."
15,01        "Will do," Wilkens replied, turned and gave the other two fellows on
