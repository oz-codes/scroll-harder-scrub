15,01Short Story (number 2)
15,01Characterization Episode
15,01Jesse Jackson


15,01--It was quiet.  It was hot.  It was quiet and hot.  The dogs were barking 
15,01outside, perhaps in preparation for something that we couldn't see.  The 
15,01canine prophet.  What a disgusting image of perpetual sacrilege?--

15,01'Fuck!'

15,01Jacob ripped another page of paper out of his typewriter, and in one motion 
15,01carried his arm in a arc, to let loose the ball and send it sailing into 
15,01overtime.  Buzzer.  Garbage can.  It's all over.  Another game, lost by one 
15,01thing.  It's always only one thing.  Blame.  Be blind to what's been building up
15,01 to the point you're at.  Find the scapegoat and dance.
15,01Inspiration was all that he needed, what a cliche.  The suffering student, 
15,01with writers block.  Perhaps he was asking for more that he bargained for.

15,01'Knock - Knock,' said the door.

15,01He looked down, and up again.  Without a verbal response, he arose and walked 
15,01over to the door, with the original intention of opening it.  How ironic.  
15,01That was the action he ended up with.

15,01'Yes, mom?'  He over-accentuated the yes, with the sarcasm fully implied.  
15,01And yet it went without obvious notice from the other party.

15,01'I wanted to see how your paper was coming, and to ask if you wanted a bowl 
15,01of soup?'

15,01'As of now, the paper isn't coming.  I'm so stuck. Everything that I writ
15,01e sticks out, and doesn't flow.  Soup?  No.  I really don't have time for 
15,01that.  This assignment is due tomorrow.'

15,01'It's a real shame (shame / embarrass / humiliate / bother / pester / annoy 
15,01/ get-the-hell-away-from-me) about your homework honey, but try to eat 
15,01something.  I'll leave a bowl right outside your door.'

15,01'Okay, okay, whatever.  I need to get back to work now.  Goodnight.'  And 
15,01with that, the door was closed.

15,01His clothes were wool now.  They didn't fit right either.  There was a string 
15,01on the inside, and it went all around his body.  Could he breathe?  Did it 
15,01matter?  After all, plants were able to utilize light energy and create food.  
15,01Lived off the refuse of the living.  Could he not be the same?  Then again, 
15,01plants don't write papers either.  At least not for Mr. Dratsab.

15,01Back to the typewriter.

15,01--Cold night.  Warm soup.  And you.  My mother, dying in the seas of saran 
15,01wrap.  The end of the world is close to the end of the table.  That's how 
15,01gravity works.  A huge ball of  sand, poured out on the beach. 110 percent.  
15,01Make the team.  Give your all.  Do your best.  The microphone can only make 
15,01you so important.  But not more of a man.  This would be the purpose of 
15,01television, bastard child of vision and sound.--

15,01'Damn.'  Colin was still clueless in where his story was going.  Even though 
15,01his name wasn't Colin, it didn't really matter.  (Huge Fucking Pants.)  What 
15,01people called him was no longer relevant.  The paper was relevant.

15,01The room wasn't 'normal'.  The posters were gone.  The bed was gone.  Only a 
15,01typewriter, and a child, growing younger in his inability.  Naked, womb 
15,01seeking worm.  Furious, overturning that which was not there.  Hair pulling, 
15,01nail biting, on the edge of your seat.  Pull down, final blow, rest in peace.

15,01The man was there.  He was still tired.  And his attempts still as futile as 
15,01the child so many years before.  Weak, car driving, 9 to 6, functional 
15,01illiterate in his tendency to constipate thoughts.  That is, an inability 
15,01to transpose / transpire onto ledgers.  Darkness, English teacher, broken 
15,01bottles, spanked children.

15,01'Marge (whatever the hell your name is, doesn't matter.  you're still bitch 
15,01to me),  I'm home [cheerful voice], how's dinner coming?'

15,01'Oh!  You're home... the children are spending the night at friends houses.  
15,01So I wasn't planning on really making dinner.  I think there some frozen 
15,01dinners in the freezer, you can cook one of those up, if you want...'  She 
15,01trails off, he couldn't hear her anything.
