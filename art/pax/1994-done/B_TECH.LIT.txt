15,01# the technicolor yawn

15,01one night while i was walking down the streets of New Orleans,
15,01i had just consumed a hot dog, four beers and some beans.
15,01when suddenly from my insides a rumbling began to start.
15,01i shrugged it off and thought to myself, "it's prolly juss a fart."
15,01what i hadn't realized, was my stomach, it was a churning.
15,01i hadn't realized yet, but my heart, it too was a burning.
15,01this amazing event that i had shrugged off with such malice,
15,01was commonly known as the wonder of peristalsis.
15,01my mouth it flew wide open,so i wouldn't choke.
15,01the sick warm sticky fluid shot out of my throat.
15,01it flew across the street, some landed in a gutter.
15,01it flew over a little boy but landed on his mother.
15,01well, just like some unruly terrorist Israeli faction,
15,01the verb i'd conjugated caused a chain reaction.
15,01i ran and i ran, i had to get out of there.
15,01i knew that before soon, bile would be everywhere.
15,01people in windows, shops and street corners,
15,01little boys and girls, dogs and shop owners,
15,01all began to vomit, barf upchuck and spew.
15,01all because of that stuff that out of me did flew.
15,01i looked down at the colourful bile-coated street.
15,01i gazed down at the sickly chunks that laid upon my feet
15,01i pondered upon a small chunk that was semi-round and flat.
15,01but for some strange reason, i didn't recall eating that.
15,01i gazed up at the sky, it was light, there was dawn.
15,01then suddenly it hit me! the Technicolor Yawn!
15,01i spewed out all my insides, it was a sickly sight.
15,01i just hoped when it was over, i would be alright.
15,01i lay there with my eyes closed my spine it was a shiver.
15,01beside me i knew there lay my intestine and my liver.
15,01the life it dribbled out of me like the bile on the ground.
15,01it dribbled from my sticky mouth, frozen in a frown.

15,01if you go to New Orleans, please leave before the dawn.
15,01Or you may be attacked by the Technicolor Yawn.
