15,01                                  BUGS & SUCH

15,01       Well, the viewer is pretty much bug-free, except for a few things.
15,01     The GIF/PCX viewing code did not function properly so the VGA viewing
15,01     does not work in this version. We have included a quick and easy GIF
15,01     viewer called VIEWGIF.EXE with the viewer. We apologize for any in-
15,01     convenience. On certain computer systems (like my shitty BSR 386SuX/16) 
15,01     the MOD files will not play just because your computer sucks :) When 
15,01     listening to a MOD we advise against viewing an ansi.

15,01        If you have suggestions/comments about the viewer or any other CiA
15,01      work, contact any CiA member on a board near you. Feedback is always
15,01      welcome. If you wish to contact myself or PeaCe Keeper you can call
15,01      up my board, /+POCALYPSE at 201-934-5613 and E-mail either one of us.
15,01      Look for a great new viewer next month with many new features! We hope
15,01      you enjoy the January 1994 CiA pack, see you next month.
