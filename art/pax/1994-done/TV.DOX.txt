15,01 Artists have always pissed and moaned about the limitations of ANSi.  One of
15,01 these limitations has been only 80 columns worth of width.  Between ANSIM's
15,01 advent of VGA Viewing, with it's wrap mode, and TheDraw's 160 width support,
15,01 I've been wanting to push this boundry.  Unfortunately, no other coder of no
15,01 other viewer from no other group has been able to or BOTHERED to explore the
15,01 possibilities of the .BIN format.  With THIS version of TV we *NOW* have a
15,01 fully functional .BIN Viewer, in both text and graphics modes.

15,01 You can use .BIN as easily as you .ANS, really.  Simply go into TheDraw, the
15,01 ONLY ANSi Editor currently with 160/.BIN support, under the Options submenu,
15,01 select Setup Options.  The very FIRST option is "Worksheet Width", which you
15,01 want to toggle from 80 to 160.  You will see the second option, "Worksheet
15,01 Depth" go from 100 to 50, which is the current maximum per Page in 160 Mode.
15,01 You then draw your ANSi, now with 160 columns.  When you're ready to save it
15,01 all you do is select (B)inary.  If your finished ANSi is going to be longer
15,01 than 50 lines, and it probably will be, simply use the same "COPY" Method
15,01 you do with .ANS files.  (IE: C:\THEDRAW>COPY 1.BIN + 2.BIN 3.BIN)

15,01 To do .BIN's wider than 160, use the utility BINCPY to copy like length
15,01 segments horizontaly.  If the ANSi is longer than the drawing program can
15,01 support, you can then use the copy command, as above, to copy like width
15,01 segements together.  Kind of like virtual building blocks.

15,01 I've been playing with ANSi to VGA interputation for a couple months
15,01 now and have talked to a few artists and here's what I've come up with.
15,01 When ANSi is drawn there are two distinct looks/aspect ratios, 25 and
15,01 50 row modes. In 25 row mode, each charactor is about twice as tall as
15,01 it is wide, whereas in 50 row mode, each charactor is about as tall as
15,01 it is wide.  Thus, an ANSi can look distorted if interpreted wrong. 25
15,01 row mode ANSis look squished in 50 row mode and 50 row mode ANSis look
15,01 stretched in 25 row mode.  The technical term for this is ASPECT RATIO,
15,01 the ratio of X:Y for the pixels to form a perfect square.  ACiD has
15,01 always avoided this issue by supporting just one aspect ratio or an
15,01 aspect ratio that is half way between the two.  Thus many ANSis look
15,01 distorted.  Until now, iCE has been the only group to deal with this
15,01 issue with any success.  I also have heard a lot of compliments about
15,01 the wide mode in old ACiDViEWs, so I have included wide modes that
15,01 still maintain the correct aspect ratios.

15,01 I did not put in the multiple fonts like I had in viewers I've done in
15,01 the past, because not only is this somewhat confusing, most fonts cause
15,01 distortion upon the ratio.  I belive that artists should have control
15,01 over the way their work is viewed.  Now the fonts are built into the
15,01 modes, and the artist has regained complete control.
