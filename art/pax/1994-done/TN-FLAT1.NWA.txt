00,01    14His wife is 15in waiting 00in the hall,
00,01    14Crying, hop15ing, prayin00g,
00,01    14Praying to 15god that he00r husband won't die.

00,01    14The blood i15s barely fl00owing through his veins,
00,01    14He is fight15ing to stay 00alive.
00,01    14I'm fightin15g to keep h00im alive.
