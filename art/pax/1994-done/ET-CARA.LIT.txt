15,01wispy whI know that some of the people that just read this story have
15,01met me in person and know that I, like Cara, am in a wheelchair. she'd
15,01Reading this, one might make false judgements about my life and
15,01my emotional state at the moment. The fact that both Cara (theht
15,01FICTIONAL character) and I are in a wheelchair is where the to
15,01similarities in us end. I didn't get thrown down a hill when I was young,
15,01I have supportive parents and I'm not suicidal... if one must, imagine my
15,01life to be the setting or stage, with Cara wandering in and manipulating it
15,01with her own personality... e warm sunshine coming through the
15,01window. I just wanted to clear that up...ng metal table by the
15,01window. A dirty spoon clattered to the floor. It didn't matter,
15,01there was no way she could have caught i-Etana*MiST->SAUCE00Cara

15,01                     from the window, it was easier to see her bent
15,01body. Her back sagged forward and keeping her head up was a
15,01constant effort. Scrawny, pathetically thin legs hung to the
15,01metal footrests, legs whose only exercise was to be moved by the
15,01therapist.
15,01        She gazed out the window into the park outside the hospital.
15,01There were many children there, laughing, playing... running.
15,01Yes, they were running everywhere, and so very quickly. It would
15,01take them seconds to travel a distance that took her minutes.
15,01The doctors had told her that she could never walk, her legs
15,01were much too weak. Sometimes she wondered why they allowed the
15,01children to come and torture the forlorn occupants of the
15,01hospital with their laughter and play.
15,01        She was 16 now, really too old to stay in the Children's
15,01Hospital. There had been a time when she too was a child, young
15,01and happy. When the effort it took to smile or laugh was worth
15,01the while...


15,01        "Cara? Cara! C'mon! Let's go out and play!" the young girl
15,01said, her blonde pony tails bouncing with delight.
15,01        "All right," Cara said, but the words came out drawled and
15,01slurred. This did not deter her happy companion, and she pushed
15,01Cara's wheelchair toward the ramp.
15,01        It was windy outside and the red-orange leaves were rolling
15,01merrily along the playground. The wind tugged at their hair and
15,01the other girl's pony tails began to wave wildly. Cara laughed.
15,01        "Do you want to play ball?" her friend asked.
15,01        Cara nodded, and her friend ran off to get a ball. She returned
15,01with a small bouncy red one and Cara smiled approvingly.
15,01        "Okay now," the girl said. "I'm going to throw it to you and
15,01you must catch it!"
15,01        Cara nodded again, too excited to speak.
15,01        The girl threw the ball and it bounced off Cara's unresponding
15,01hands. The girl fetched the ball, "That's okay, we'll try again!"
15,01        But neither "trying again" or the girl's enthusiasm seemed to
15,01help Cara catch the elusive rubber ball. The girl looked
15,01thoughtfully at Cara and Cara looked very frustrated. This was
15,01not turning out to be as much fun as she had originally thought.
15,01        "I have an idea," the girl smiled broadly. "Put your arms out
15,01like this.." The girl demonstrated her idea, "and catch it by
15,01pulling your arms to your chest, okay?"
15,01        Cara nodded, she was ready to try anything just to catch that
15,01red ball.
15,01        The girl threw the ball lightly and carefully to Cara and its
15,01gentle arc placed it right between Cara's forearms. Cara
15,01carefully drew her arms and the ball the her chest, she had
15,01caught it! The other girl clapped wildly and Cara grinned back.


15,01        "Yes," the older Cara by the window thought. "Those were good
15,01days." But, like the saying goes, all good things must come to
15,01an end. It was not long before the novelty of playing with her
15,01wore off and the young blonde found better things to do with her
15,01time. Oh, they still played when she asked, but pity was
15,01transparent through those young blue eyes.
15,01        It wasn't long till her classmates began to see her differences
15,01as threatening, drawing the grownups attention away from them.
15,01Cara was something to be feared and mocked. She was no longer
15,01special, but a freak. At first their new moves were harmless,
15,01notes in her pencil box calling her a "Freak" and a "Cripple".
15,01This grew into taunting and insults, knowing all to well she
