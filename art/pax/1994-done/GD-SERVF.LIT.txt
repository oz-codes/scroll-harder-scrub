15,01servants friend.

15,01was caught there once before
15,01yet i escaped through my magic door
15,01not all was lost cause i aint poor
15,01bought my ticket through the door

15,01though the light blinded me
15,01i fought forward so i could see
15,01the thoughts of a deads mans obscurity
15,01lost in the waves of sanity

15,01underneath the sites of time
15,01wanders a talking mime
15,01asking what next to chime
15,01saying fuck its only partime

15,01being sucked in by it all
15,01preparing for my last fall
15,01one gentle step to my final call
15,01prisoner in a boardless stall

15,01irony is yet to sweet
15,01cost me more than i dare greet
15,01a magic bundle of overgrown wheat
15,01ready for an overwhelming feat

15,01so on i climb to my despair
15,01ready to slip through the air
15,01without a peep without a care
15,01through lifes self-made tear.

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
