06,01I return again to this place of worship,
06,01Though no altar there may be.
06,01I gaze up, and lo, the gothic arch,
06,01Formed from bow and tree.
06,01This, truly, I say must be the cathedral of God,
06,01For no pillar man has made,
06,01To match the trunk of this fair glade,
06,01No marble compares to this silken sod.

06,01I return again to this place of worship,
06,01That my soul may be free.
06,01My spirit lifts up and flies as an eagle,
06,01From my body finally free.
06,01Though many have come and gone,
06,01Most leave ne'er to return.

06,01To me you truly gave birth.

15,01Hope you all enjoy this one... I think it is one of my finest efforts thusfar.
15,01I wonder if anyone will know what it is about?
15,01If you do gimme a ring on Straight No Chaser(901) or Falling Fast(601)
