15,01                      ***** THE BASICS *****

15,01Q.  What's this group all about, anyways?
15,01A.  We are a newsgroup dedicated to stopping a quiet and hostile takeover
15,01    of the Earth by the incredibly powerful, unimaginable evil, disgustingly
15,01    cute DevilBunnies.  As Bunnyhunters, we are the only thing that stands
15,01    between a disbelieving human race and horrible, inescapable fluffy
15,01    doom.

15,01Q.  You've got to be kidding.
15,01A.  Yeah, I am.  Sure.  Just wait until that cute grey bunny that lives 
15,01    under the pine tree in your backyard carries off your grandmother for
15,01    some unholy feast.  Then you'll say to yourself, "Oh, I should have
15,01    listened," but it'll be too late.  We warned you.

15,01Q.  OK, I'm convinced.  How do I get involved in this war?
15,01A.  It's customary to post an introductory message to the group, but that
15,01    isn't necessary.  If you really want to get involved, start watching
15,01    your neighborhood for signs of Bunny incursion (nibbled lettuce in your
15,01    garden, littly bunny pellets outside of your windows, ect.)  Report
15,01    any suspicious activity to the nearest Army of Fudd High Command (AFHC).
15,01    Do not, I repeat, *DO NOT* attempt to confront DevilBunnies by yourself.
15,01    Your local AFHC provides weaponry, training, and professional help.

15,01Q.  What is a DevilBunny?
15,01A.  "Think of the most powerful thing you can (I mean like a black hole
15,01    or a supernova, not a Chevy).  Double it.  Add sharp things.  Remove
15,01    all goodness.  Wrap it in a cute, cuddly bunny costume."  -- John
15,01    Chaffey.

15,01Q.  What do they look like?
15,01A.  DevilBunnies look exactly like regular bunny rabbits.

15,01Q.  How can you tell if it's a DevilBunny and not a regular bunny?
15,01A.  You can't, at least without years of highly specialized training.
15,01    To be on the safe side, all bunnies are considered suspect, and are
15,01    terminated with extreme prejudice.

15,01Q.  What makes DevilBunnies so dangerous?
15,01A.  Well, apart from the fact that they can rip whole towns apart, they
15,01    are incredibly cute.  Just think of how insidious this war is.  The
15,01    DBs can move around the countryside with relative impunity.  They are
15,01    mistaken for harmless and sweet animals.  Using their cuteness as
15,01    cover, they can infiltrate our communities, seduce our loved ones, and
15,01    take over the world.

15,01Q.  Where do DevilBunnies come from?
15,01A.  This is unknown right now.  Current research indicates that they may
15,01    be from another planet, or possibly another dimension.

15,01Q.  What is the scientific designation for DevilBunnies?
15,01A.  Lagomorph Demonicus.

15,01Q.  What is the Bunnyhunter's motto?
15,01A.  "Sic semper tyrannis et culiculis daemoniacis!"  (Thus ever to tyrants
15,01    and DevilBunnies!)

15,01Q.  What do DevilBunnies eat?
15,01A.  Oh, the usual.  Carrots, lettuce, grass.  They seem to be fond of
15,01    parsley and spinach as well.  Oh yeah, and they love human toes...

15,01Q.  Why do they write things like "Fluffy wiggle" in their posts?
