15,01Point of No Return  * Death *

15,01        A glint of a blade and the sweat on the skin.
15,01        Nervous tension fills her head as she prepares.
15,01        Never wanted and never loved in her life,
15,01        She sits alone, lonely and sheltered from the world.

15,01        Abandoned at the age of four by the world around her
15,01        Now she plans to abandon that world that brought her aches.
15,01        Trapped by the empty skin of life and the chasm of pain
15,01        Dumped on her soul by things she has no control over.

15,01        She waits, pondering what she has and what she wants.
15,01        The walls of her room is decorated with torn wallpaper         
15,01        When nobody is there to listen to her last lament.
15,01        Her decision comes much too easily to her mind.

15,01        The edge flashes as it hits the light
15,01        Her blood erupts as the blade pierces the wrist.
15,01        Her life slowly ebbs from within along with her blood
15,01        No one hears her cries that shatter the still of the night
15,01        
15,01        And then there is nothing.
15,01        No pain, no sound, no life, no nothing.
15,01        She did what she felt she had to do
15,01        And passed the point of no return.
