15,01                        Men march in the slumber of war,
15,01                       Zombie-like in mindless submission;
15,01                     And destruction becomes a form of art,
15,01                    For that's all they have - no decisions.

15,01                      Age upon age descends into darkness
15,01                 And the hour grows later as the moon turns red;
15,01                 And all that is seen are maimed bodies in ruin;
15,01                And all that is smelt is the stench of the dead.

15,01                     War upon war as the clock turns faster.
15,01                    The date of apocalypse draws into sight.
15,01                  And the men march in haste, so not to be late
15,01                     For the final fight to end all fights.

15,01                       The morning dawns cold and somber.
15,01                 The sky is black with marbled patterns of gray,
15,01                 For the sun won't shine on the eve of disaster
15,01                   And all the world readies to fall to decay.

15,01                     Row upon row, the armies stand ready -
15,01                 Millions of millitant men in their war-stance;
15,01                   And line upon line of tanks stand prepared
15,01                   As do thousands of other hellish armaments.

15,01                      The crow calls, harsh and unyielding,
15,01                 Signaling that battle has found place to begin.
15,01             And all the armies attack with their half-hearted cries
15,01                 For they know it's a war that no one will win.

15,01                     The hours pass as the lightning flashes
15,01                And all the demons of hell seem to join the fray.
15,01                   It is almost like Pandora's Box reopened -
15,01                     Seems like humanity is all washed away.

15,01                     As the evening draws to quiet silence,
15,01                The chapter of death waits for the page to turn;
15,01                  All know that hell will reopen with morning,
15,01                    But night is a time to listen and learn.

15,01                  Then, as the red globe of the moon is rising,
15,01                       Something seems to stir in the air;
15,01                    And a ghastly apparition of Satan appears
15,01                   As the few living warriors gape and stare.

15,01                    The Devil laughs across the battleground,
15,01               "This has been your death; this will be your tomb.
15,01                    And only then do the men awaken to truth,
15,01                And realize they have entered the Chasm of Doom.
