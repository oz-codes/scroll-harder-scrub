15,01         by White Power 

15,01I can't escape this liquid hell
15,01I can't break out of this drunken cell

15,01When I close my eyes the world seems to spin
15,01I am trying to stop but I will never win

15,01I go to work but it stays on my mind
15,01no matter how far I run I'm always confined

15,01Straight back to my house is where I go 
15,01I tell my self I won't do it but yet I know

15,01I lock myself in, I tie myself down
15,01In a place having no light or no sound

15,01As I feel my brain beginning to crack
15,01I cut the ropes and head right back

15,01I can't wait to taste that foamy, gold malt
15,01It is my God but its not my fault

15,01I'm broke, without it I huddle in fear
15,01trying to remember a place that serves Free Beer.
