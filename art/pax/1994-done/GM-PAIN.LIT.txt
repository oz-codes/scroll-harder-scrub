15,01                                     ..G.M.

15,01                               What's in a word?
15,01                                       I,
15,01             can't think of any word that can explain the feelings,
15,01                              I have inside of me.
15,01                                     Pain,
15,01                                      joy,
15,01                                     anger,
15,01                                     lust,
15,01                                    jelousy,
15,01                                     bliss.
15,01                                Maybe it's love.
15,01  The 'L' stands for the lonliness and longing deep down in every corner of my
15,01                          heart when she is not near.
15,01            The 'O' represents how many times a day I think of her,
15,01            over and over and over and over and over and over again.
15,01                  The 'V' stands for how very much I love her.
15,01                And the 'E' is for the emptieness I feel inside,
15,01                             everytime she's away.
15,01                                    Oh god,
15,01                                   it hurts.
15,01                                 I don't know.
15,01                  The jelousy comes so fast and stays so long.
15,01                                   At night,
15,01                                    in bed,
15,01                                thinking of her.
15,01                       With a tear running down my cheek.
15,01                                   It hurts,
15,01                      it hurts so bad I wish I could die.
15,01                                 The wondering,
15,01                                  the hoping,
15,01                                  the praying.
15,01                All the things I wish I could do and say to her.
15,01                          It hurts to keep it inside.
15,01                          I wish I could talk to her.
15,01                             I wish it didn't hurt.
15,01                                    Longing,
15,01                                 for her touch,
15,01                                   her voice,
15,01                                   anything.
15,01                                I wish I could.
15,01      The anger when I see someone when I see somebody even bump into her.
15,01                                      God,
15,01                                 I could kill,
15,01                        her scars will hurt me forever.
15,01              Longer and more than they ever did or will hurt her.
15,01                           Her voice makes me tingle.
15,01                        Her touch brings me to my knees.
15,01                                   Her hair,
15,01                      it bounces and plays about her face,
15,01                             in a carefree manner.
15,01                              I long to touch her,
15,01                                  to feel her,
15,01                              to know all of her.
15,01                                    Oh god,
15,01                                   the pain.
15,01                          What's been done to my life?
15,01                     I never would have it differnt though.
15,01                          Not in a billion life times.
15,01                                Always with her.
15,01                                 I don't know,
15,01                     I think I could get to like this pain.
15,01                                   But only,
15,01                                    for her.

15,01                                     'End'
