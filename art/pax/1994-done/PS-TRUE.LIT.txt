15,01                                 True Love

15,01Eaten by fire, consumed by lust,
15,01I search for you..
15,01Deny me again,
15,01And I will show you my fury..
15,01For You have denied me your love one too many times..
15,01I come with the anger of a generation and the power of a god..
15,01Searching through the streets, travelling at night,
15,01I watch you through your bedroom window..
15,01I follow you to work..
15,01I'm right behind you when you jog in the morning..
15,01I will have you this time..
15,01The police could not stop me,
15,01You cannot stop me,
15,01I want you so bad..
15,01I ache at night, throb in the day..
15,01Tonight, I shall have you..
15,01I follow you to your door, right behind you..
15,01You can't hear me, I've waited so long..
15,01My hand over your mouth, my knife at your throat..
15,01Cutting deeper, smoother, blood runs like water..
15,01Taking you to the bedroom, I will be sated at last..
15,01Shredding your clothes, ripping your jeans..
15,01Driving in harder, faster, deeper..
15,01Consumed by unholy lust..
15,01Cutting you open, tasting your fluids..
15,01Death fresh on my breath, I hunger more..
15,01Faster, harder, deeper..
15,01Thunder roars, seas part, another life has past through my hands..
