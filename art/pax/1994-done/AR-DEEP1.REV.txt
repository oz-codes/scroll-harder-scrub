15,01the rest so deep

15,01Mother Earth shall shed her tears
15,01mourning for forgotten years
15,01weak and shattered; there she lies
15,01weeping softly 'till she dies.

15,01our mankind needs blood to shed
15,01blood for blood; 'till all are dead
15,01wrong and right, can't be perceived
15,01nor will values be believed.

15,01refuse, repent, revolt within
15,01break the chains that cage you in!
15,01let in turn, the Earth's embrace
15,01take you from your heart's deface.

15,01drift into the rest so deep
15,01cold and everlasting sleep
15,01close your weary eyes sublime
15,01let the wars resolve in time.
