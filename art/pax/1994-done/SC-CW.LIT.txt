15,01                           09As you step up the way,
15,01                             08A 09green 08glowing ooze,
15,01                          00And some old smelly shoes.
15,01                             03That's all you see,
15,01                            09But the waste and such
15,01                           08Some soil here and there,
15,01                            00But there is not much.
15,01                             03A slew of chemicals,
15,01                            09Thrown left and right,
15,01                          08A hand grabs your shoulder,
15,01                          00You turn with great fright.
15,01                               03No need to fear,
15,01                               09I am a kind soul,
15,01                              08My name is Hammer,
15,01                            00And I've paid the toll.
15,01                           03I entered here long ago,
15,01                            09When I was once young,
15,01                         08I've been trapped here since,
15,01                          00To this land I have clung.
15,01                            03The land you see here,
15,01                          09Was once filled with power,
15,01                          08Now it's just a wasteland,
15,01                            00And you start to cowar.
15,01                                 03You, my son,
15,01                            09A once wise young man,
15,01                         08You're trapped here forever,
15,01                          00In the Chemical Wasteland.
