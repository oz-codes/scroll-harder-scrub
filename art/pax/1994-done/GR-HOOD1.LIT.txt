00,01Issue 0

00,01Welcome to issue 0 of The Rook's Cyberhood. In this issue I will be writing
00,01about shit I think is cool. In future issues I will be giving out some good
00,01revenge tactics as well as ways for newer users to get onto better boards.
00,01(well, at least those are my plans.) this first issue is for AnonyMous's
00,01magazine and I will be putting future issues in it as well as distributing 
00,01some of my golden gems of writing though another group called iCS. To contact
00,01me you can call my bulletin board and leave the sysop matrix feedback, or 
00,01logon as new. Throbbing Gristle (817)551-5404.

00,01-Issue 0 - Cool stuff.



00,01  OK, the first thing I want to talk about in my 'cool stuff' article is blue
00,01toilet water. I recently moved into my own appartment (another adventure)
00,01and cam to the big conclusion that blue toilet water looks cool. Right away
00,01I hopped into my pimping ride and hauled my fat ass to Target to buy some
00,01blue toilet shit. When I got there I found 2 products that would make my shit-
00,01water turn blue -- Vanish Drop-ins and 2000 Flushes. I bought a couple of the
00,01Vanish ones in the blue flavor - they also come in green but I can piss into
00,01the blue water and turn it green so that one was out- and headed home. I 
00,01followed the instructions to the letter and waited....and waited. After
00,012 pisses and a shit I finally got my blueness to come out. it lasted about 
00,013 weeks. That sucked. Next time I was at Target I got 2000 Flushes and tried
00,01it out. SHAZAM! it worked the first flush! I've had the 200 Flushes in the
00,01tank for what seems forever and I am still getting the lovely blueness I so
00,01require to make my life whole. I know by now you are saying to yourself - WHY
00,01DOES THIS ASSHOLE WANT BLUE WATER? well, fuckface it's because when you are
00,01drunk as hell and you take a piss Yellow and blue make green.


00,01  Next thing on my agenda is Japamation (or whatever those oriental movies are
00,01called.) I've recently gotten hooked on these movies because I think that gore
00,01and cartoon characters saying "SHIT!" is cool. this is how I review them:

00,011. Gore content - I L-O-V-E to see heads explode and arms being ripped off.
00,01   this is a BIG plus for me. 
00,012. Art qualitiy - I am very impressed with good animation and feel more 'into
00,01   it' if the artowork is good. Who wants to see some guy get his arms ripped
00,01   off if all it looks like is a red fucking crayola.
00,013. The Plot - I'm kinda stupid so, keep it simple and VIOLENT.


00,01Ok, so in no particular order here are some flics....

00,01.FIST OF THE NORTH STAR:
00,01  Possibly the BEST one of all time. The movie is based in the future where the15 
00,01 world is pretty much a driued out husk. The main character is *The Northstar*
00,01 a guy that pretty much kicks ass -except for at the beginning of the movie
00,01 when the Southstar kicks his ass and then he gets thrown over a cliff. After
00,01 that, he whips some tail. His powers are kind like Bruce Lee's fast punching
00,01 except for Bruce didn't make their heads explode. The most memorable scene is
00,01 when one of the good guys is being attact by a bad guy and the good guy (Ray)
00,01 ripps off the bad guys arms....very bloody...
00,01 The dialogue is corny as hell but that only seems to add to the coolness of
00,01 the video. The artwork isn't the best but the gore rating makes this one of my15 
00,01 favorites.

00,01.The Tank Police (pt. 1 and 2)
00,01   This video is -OK- not the best but I think that most fans of animation will15 
00,01 enjoy watching it. Gore rating is small... Animation is good...The plot is
