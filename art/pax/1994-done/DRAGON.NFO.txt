15,01How to draw a lamo PE pic:
15,01-------------------------

15,01Goal: To draw two dragons in the sky like fighting or fucking, I haven't 
15,01decided yet. fubar.

15,01Okay...

15,01This guide is mainly for Asriel because for some reason, I think he 
15,01thinks I'm like good at this for some reason. Anyways, but this also for 
15,01Dr. Death or any one else who asked me for tips. If ya'll can't take a 
15,01hint, this file is for you. It should answer your questions. Now, leave 
15,01me alone! (j/k)

15,01Any gay old program should be able to this gay picture, because instead 
15,01of using my usually Photoshop for this pic I used a gay PD paint program. 
15,01Why? Because, I'm sleepy and Photoshop is too slow.

15,01Well, this pictures isn't the best in the world (acually.. I sorta like 
15,01the black and white, it just that the colouring is gay. Hopefully 
15,01somebody better than me, like Shockwave (or so Shihear says.. I still 
15,01haven't seen any from him) will make up maybe a ACiD GUiDE to help ME 
15,01colour. Anyways, this will give you the general idea on how I do my VGAs. 

15,01Anyways... on with the show...

15,011) Well, there really aren't any definate order of shit you do, but I'll 
15,01attempt to put some order into this. Anyways, step one, brainstorm. I 
15,01know.. I know... this sounds gay. I agree, but I do it anyways. ("You're 
15,01like... pretty gay sometimes.."-- Dr. Death) VGA is both probably the 
15,01hardest and the easiest thing to do. Its easy because if you a a tiny bit 
15,01a talent you can do a vga. It is the hardest thing to do, because, 
15,01unlike ansi, if you do damn same thing over and over and over and over 
15,01again, people think you suck (come on.. how much talent does it take to 
15,01draw a blue face or a green face). Anyways, brainstorm. Hmm... didn't I 
15,01saw at the top we were doing dragons? 

15,012) Okay, now we get to the meat. I always say, starting is the hardest 
15,01part of any VGA. (" You dumbass, drawing it is the hardest part. Jesus, 
15,01I'm surrounded by dumbasses..."-- Shihear Kallizad) So draw a small part 
15,01of the picture somewhere around the middle. If you just work left or 
15,01right, you'll start forgeting the poportions and stuff (when you are 
15,01working with pictures bigger than your screen that is...I'm not..but if 
15,01you were...:). So draw a head. See drag01.gif. You'll get what I mean.

15,013) Okay, now that you got that done, sorta make an outline of the rest of 
15,01the body. Not to complex, not even good, just so you know the poportions 
15,01and stuff. You will probably have to go over that part anyways. The cool 
15,01thing about VGAs is it is like drawing with a pen except you can erase a 
15,01zillion times and never wear a hole in your paper. That is really a 
15,01relief when you are a real paper drawer. On paper if you make a mistake, 
15,01live with it. You really can't erase because even if you are using a 
15,01pencil, dark art pencils don't erase completely. So when you work with a 
15,01vga, you mess up, and you say to yourself, "You're pretty gay sometimes 
15,01and stuff...". Then you erase it. Cool. Don't get frustrated at this 
15,01stage if your drawings look gay. Just make an outline now. We'll make it 
15,01not so faggish a little later.

15,014) Did you do that? Cool. Now, draw where you want the hands to be. I 
15,01found it much easier to draw the hands and then the arm, than to draw the 
15,01arms then the hands. I dunno why. Maybe I'm just gay. But that why I'm in 
15,01Corp, eh? (Corp SS buddy, booya..) So, in this case we want aggressive 
15,01hostile hands. Just draw the claws and draw the hands around the claws. 
15,01Like the arms based on the hands, draw the rest of the hand depending on 
15,01how the claws are arranged. Unless your like good at hand or something 
15,01(..and we all know why YOU are so familiar with your hand...), it much 
15,01harder for a hand to not look gay if you draw fingers and then claws on 
15,01top of them. Anyways... where was I?

15,015) Okay, gayboy. Shade. I know we haven't started colouring yet. This is 
15,01like a primer you apply to minitures when you colour miniture (you do 
15,01paint minitures don't you?). Add a few black areas. Doesn't even have to 
15,01make sense. God knows mine don't. People aren't smart enough to figure 
15,01out that the shadows are in the wrong place. Just make it look cool. 
15,01Realistic is second to Coolness. Even if you are really a talentless 
15,01bastard like I am, if the pic is cool, it'll take a little bit of the
