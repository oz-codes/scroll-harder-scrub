15,01                  Chaos smothered the city in her nauseous breath,
15,01                            Like smoke from industry
15,01                    Coming down, acid rain, breeding only death-

15,01                               To see what stood...
15,01                    On the remains of a broken people's hostility,
15,01                              A unity of force could
15,01                          Break open the Illegal Embassy-

15,01                               A piece of what is,
15,01                          A man, far from home, exiled...
15,01                 The ambassdor took out the only gun that was his,
15,01                         Into his head a bullet was fired-

15,01                        So, they thought themselves worthy,
15,01                              To take over this land,
15,01                              Hostility is the key...
15,01                              Armageddon is at hand-

15,01                           Breaking through the brigades,
15,01                         Blood, sweat and tears flow free...
15,01                                  This land fades,
15,01                       Under the visage of the Illegal Embassy.
