15,01                                 00Say Bye To 10NB

10,01   00Well it is time for 10Night Breed 00to move on, he is retiring this month and
00,01   left me (10ic00) to be the new president, he has alot of school (college) and
00,01   hardly no time for the fun stuff like being president and drawing, he will
00,01however do some art here and there and will be silent in the background helping
00,01  me out a little10.  00Yes it is happening, Theater Of Pain (10nb00's board) is going
00,01  down, he is getting tired of the sysop scene (wonder why=)) but here is the
00,01point where I come in, my board is going to be the new WHQ for Rem so all of ya
00,01   Rem artists come and apply at my board and ask me questions, the number is
00,01 707-643-8827 and you'll find out the NUP some other time (like when ya logon)
15,01                 00I hope this is not to traumatic for ya'll =).

10,01 00Well 10Brainz 00has also stated that he is not going to be in Rem anymore, he also
00,01  has a job and college to worry about (which I understand how he feels) it is
00,01  hard when ya got no time to do the fun stuff in life, he is like 10Night Breed
10,01  00going to be doing some vga's and ansi for the pack here and there so expect
