15,01            02Come floating 06in a yellow sk13y
15,01            02Beyond the cl06ouds so very hi13gh.
15,01            02Until the Lan06d seems far awa13y
15,01            02The Earth tur06ns 'Round, Nigh13t turns to day.
15,01            02The Dawn sets 06on her misty d13eed
15,01            02The Wind, he 06blows in on his 13Steed.
15,01            02The Wind Play06s On His Brazen 13Horn
15,01            02From Curving 06Bell a Sound is 13Born.
15,01            02The Hounds of 06Night come run13ning Forth
15,01            02Behind their 06Master, heading 13North.
15,01            02The Wind goes 06North, Hounds 13close behind
15,01            02The Chase is 06On, to Hunt the 13Hind.
15,01            02As White as S06now, the Hind t13hen Fled
15,01            02Up to the Yel06low Sky, now Re13d.
15,01            02The Wind had 06hunted Wolves a13nd Boar
15,01            02Come Dusk the 06Hind would be 13no More.
15,01            02The Wind he s06wore he'd have 13its head
15,01            02By Sun-set it 06would be stone 13Dead.
15,01            02The Blood-Red 06sky moves swif13tly Back
15,01            02It turns to C06ool White, then 13to Black.
15,01            02The Hind, hor06ns pointing to 13the Sky
15,01            02Leaps to the 06Night, a desper13ate try.
15,01            02The Wind draw06s back his glin13ting Bow
15,01            02He pulls it t06aut, and then l13ets go.
15,01            02The spinning 06shaft, with awe13some might
15,01            02Flies Past th06e Hind, into th13e Night.
15,01            02The Wind then 06drew the Spear 13of Stone
15,01            02As it was lau06nched, the Hind 13did moan.
15,01            02For in the fl06ank the Hind wa13s struck
15,01            02The Hounds dr06ew near, the Hi13nd did buck.
15,01            02But all that 06was to no avail13,
15,01            02The Hunt drew 06on, through da13rkened dale.
15,01            02The Hind hid 06midst a shrubbe13r's Maze
15,01            02Wind followed 06through, got s13tuck for days.
15,01            02The Hind came 06through the ot13her end
15,01            02Though Night-06bred Hounds wer13e back a bend.
15,01            02They all came 06loose, the Hin13d was free
15,01            02And veered pa06st Wind, behind 13a tree.
15,01            02The Wind did 06Curse, and drew 13his Knife
15,01            02And vowed the 06Hind would los13e his Life.
15,01            02But as the Ho06unds and Wind d13rew near,
15,01            02The Hind slow06ed down, eyes f13ull of Fear.
15,01            02It lay down n06ear a mossy bro13ok,
15,01            02Gazed on the 06Wind, and then 13it shook.
15,01            02It took a dri06nk, looked up a13nd sighed,
15,01            02then closed i06ts eyes and the13re it died.
15,01            02Wind sheathed 06his knife, got 13on his steed,
15,01            02and contempla06ted Death and G13reed.
15,01            02He parted Hom06e, far to the E13ast
15,01            02and left the 06Great and Noble 13Beast.
