00,01              For Now............

00,01Slowly the sun begins to set
00,01Darkness moves in and smothers the day's last breath
00,01until, finally, it has killed it off
00,01for now
00,01But alas, Darkness does not come alone
00,01for it brings fear and hatred with it
00,01a fear that is not easily overcome
00,01a hatred so great that day dares not shed it's light
00,01for now
00,01Darkness lives as daylight dies
00,01this ageless struggle never ceases
00,01light has once again lost to darkness
00,01for now......
