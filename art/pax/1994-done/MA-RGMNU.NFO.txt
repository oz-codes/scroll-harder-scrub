15,01   Whats up kiddies, it's me again. I don't know whats up with me and doing
15,01 menu sets lately. Anyway, you know the story. Don't change my name or any
15,01 part of the ansis except the commands. Those you can change to better suit
15,01 your BBS setup. I only did the main menus. The rest you'll have to do you
15,01 lazy bastards. Us them wisely, they're the only Maestro menus you'll ever
15,01 get for free.
