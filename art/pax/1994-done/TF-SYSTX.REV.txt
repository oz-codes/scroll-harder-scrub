15,01Systematic Destruction

15,01Take me down to the other side,
15,01Where laws are not known and doves cry.
15,01I must go through this inspiring door,
15,01To see what lies ahead to explore.
15,01I cannot find this magical land,
15,01I must reach out and be lent a hand.
15,01Someone please, if you hear my screams,
15,01Do not hesitate and do not deem.
15,01Travel far to find my room,
15,01Before I lose and meet my doom.
15,01Ride quick through heavens gates,
15,01Rescue me from these evil states.
15,01You will come upon visions so real,
15,01Do not reach out, it is not yours to steal.
15,01Commit no crimes on your uncharted ride,
15,01Follow the rules you must abide.
15,01If you are caught doing unright,
15,01Then you are gaurenteed an unfair fight.
15,01The heavens will turn dark with skies of grey.
15,01And the devil's den will be here to stay.
15,01A digital wasteland will become of the earth,
15,01And Systematic Destruction will be given it's birth.

15,01The Fugitive [Revolt]
