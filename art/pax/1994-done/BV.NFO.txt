15,01Hey, i just have a few things to say about the bladevu.. first of all,
15,01i added in a 640x480x256 pcx viewer.  Uhh, just a few more things about the
15,01viewer that were never really told.  It has 25/50 line modes, ascii+grey
15,01scales.  It has full sauce support, and can load over 200 files.  Im working
15,01on a gif viewer, a rip viewer, scrollback [almost completed], and extended
15,01vga modes, i.e. 320x200, etc. If you have any comments or suggestions on the
15,01viewer, or think you can help on what im working on, email on the internet
15,01at "rzack@wariat.org".  Or call my board, Cybernetic Holocaust,

15,01to say that ;)] and everyone that knows me ;).........

15,01Note from MC - The viewer now contains RiP support. Its still in testing
15,01               stages, but generally works fine. If you notice any extra
15,01               lines or anything that makes it look screwed, please use
15,01               acidview or the likes to view the rip's in this pak.
