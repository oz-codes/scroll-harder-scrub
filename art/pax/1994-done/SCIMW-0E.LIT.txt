15,01Last Act



15,01Purple clouds of shot viscosity
15,01Seems my thoughts are loosing velocity.
15,01Everything one paint-ball blur;
15,01A tendril of coherency is all I can infer.

15,01I'm loosing all control;
15,01Got a shotgun in my soul;
15,01With my spirit on the trigger;
15,01It's my last chance, I figure
15,01To make sense of the insanity
15,01that always seems to beckon me;
15,01Please, oh please set me free;
15,01It's my last chance to BE.

15,01White-hot knife of my life;
15,01A mirror image of this strife.
15,01This raging martial muse in my soul
15,01That steals my thoughts and all I hold.

15,01Who are you?
15,01Are yoy dear to me?
15,01Things are slipping
15,01From my memory. . .

15,01Are you for me?
15,01Are you a foe?
15,01Without my sanity,
15,01I'll never know.

15,01I'm slipping away
15,01slipping away
15,01It's fading to gray
15,01fading to gray
15,01It's fading to black
15,01fading to black
15,01The curtain closes;
15,01I was the last act.

15,01fade
