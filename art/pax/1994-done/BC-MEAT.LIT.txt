15,01heya heya.
15,01meat's meaninglessness.
15,01someone dies and it kinda makes sense eh ?
15,01meat. alpo. cow. human.
15,01meat.
15,01what difference does it make ?
15,01meat always gets eaten.. either by other meat or by bugs and bacteria.
15,01destined.
15,01you know.. you're meat.
15,01and sad but true.. we're all meaningless.
15,01I think.
15,01life makes no sense.
15,01why bother ?
15,01nothing on the other side ?
15,01why is it so weird when others end up dead.
15,01like life changes so strongly.
15,01guess the rippples in the life/death dimension are strong enough when someone
15,01near you gets ripped to the other side that you feel them.
15,01you feel the ripples of the fabric.
15,01and it affects you..
15,01like lillies with candles in a pond.
15,01the ripples will dislodge you slightly in life.
15,01things are the same but you've moved slightly.
15,01and one of the candles is now out.
