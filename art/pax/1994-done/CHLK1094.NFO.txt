02,01The First Pack.  Finally Chalk squeezes out it's first pack after two months
02,01of complete chaos.  Chalk was started in August of `94 by me, Fenric, and my
02,01buddy Cypher Creed.  Quite Honestly, the reason I started the group was because
02,01two of the groups I applied to slam dunked me back into "Independent Artist
02,01Land."  Oh well, what could I do? Nothing.  So I just whipped up a group that
02,01ended up looking not-so-shabby.  Cypher Creed did a fabulous job getting us
02,01support and we picked up a few HQ's real quick, as well as members.  Everything
02,01was looking good for Chalk in early September, we were all lined up to release
02,01our debut pack, when a combination of tragedies struck our Senior Staff.
02,01Cypher Creeds modem went kaput, and my HD went on fire...Not good to say the
02,01least. But what could I do? Virtually nothing.  I lost a shitload o' ansi's,
02,01the complete source code to CHALKVU v1.0, which I had written for this pack,
02,01and I was completely lost without Cypher's Creed's help. Well, enough about
02,01that shit no one cares...The point is that this pack is real late, and it's
02,01been a bitch. ok?

02,01Shortly after chaos struck Chalk, my old friend Blazing Shadow gave me a ring,
02,01he had been heading a primarily VGA group call UC F/X, and to make a long story
02,01short, we merged, or rather absorbed UC F/X, bringing in Blazing Shadow and
02,01another VGA Artist named SPLaT (aka El Diablo of WTU). Cable also joined our
02,01ranks in September, adding a RiP and Music Department to Chalk, as well as being
02,01an Ascii, Ansi, and VGA Artist. A well-rounded guy to say the least.  Another
02,01Ansi Artist by the name of New School also joined up with us coming from a local
02,01Long Island group called sOUP.

02,01Ok, I'm dying to masturbate so lemme get this overwith.  I just put up The
02,01Abode (201)509-0384, and I haven't set up any nets yet, so that pretty much the
02,01only way you can contact me at the present time.  If you have any questions
02,01like "wait, I thought I was a member/site/blowjob queen/whatever for chalk"
02,01then talk to me.  I lost contact with alot of people, sorry.  I am going to
02,01whip up an application generator sometime soon, til then you'll have to contact
02,01me on my board. How cheesy.

15,01               02Thats it.
