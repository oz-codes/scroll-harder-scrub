15,01so
15,01here I am.
15,01angry.

15,01Immersing myself.
15,01         drowning in the past.

15,01so.
15,01                    why am I so mad.
15,01                    will I ever experience the same feelings ?
15,01                    I honestly doubt it.
15,01 i have too much contempt for others.
15,01i hate judging people.
15,01      but lately I can't help it.

15,01everyone dissapoints
15,01 even myself.

15,01you see..
15,01I am a corner piece in the puzzle.
15,01on the edge.
15,01and only 1 kind of  other piece
15,01will fit me.

15,01I once was part of
15,01 the most awesome.
15,01          awe inspiring
15,01   art ever.

15,01on both sides.

15,01now

15,01I seemed to have been ripped when the art was destroyed.
15,01and will never find another piece
15,01 to be with
15,01  to connect to
15,01   to be art with.

15,01so I sit here.
15,01  thinking.
15,01     drowning in my tears
15,01     and memories

15,01and the past.

15,01and even my drum can't save me.

15,01why.
15,01why ?
15,01why!


15,01                          

15,01arg.
15,01you know.
15,01most people suffer heart ache
15,01but there are many flavours.

15,01and I picked the one that makes you feel crazy in the head.
15,01and the heart.

15,01and you cry,
15,01 cry,

15,01but not like when you were a kid.
15,01back then your mother would cuddle you against her breast.

15,01no.
15,01this is a new cry.
15,01a new pain.

15,01out in loveland
15,01   no one can hear you scream


15,01I love the smell of
