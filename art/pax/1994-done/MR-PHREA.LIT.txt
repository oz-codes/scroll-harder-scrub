02,01It's always childish when pretending
02,01It's like god killing and asending.

02,01I'm worse at what I do best
02,01I'm never really sure so I usually guess.

02,01I come as I are, as I were, As I always been
02,01I've been here for so long sitting here drinking some gin.

02,01As I walk I think where the fuck am I going?
02,01I am just so wasted I fall and always wake up moaning.

02,01Don't tell me what I want to hear
02,01Always afraid of knowing fear.

02,01It's hard, hard to find
02,01but all I can say is never, nevermind.

02,01I'm so sad it had to end this way
02,01but I just couldn't stay.

02,01I'm so fucked up I would just screwup
02,01I just have that bad feeling in my gut.

02,01I'm so sorry but this is the way it has to be
02,01I am tired of and I don't want to flee.

02,01I am sick of all this brutaility
02,01I am tired of being the 04Phreak of Reality02.
