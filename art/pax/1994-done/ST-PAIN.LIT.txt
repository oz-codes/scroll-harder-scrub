15,01The Pain

15,01The hours that sweep the pain before my eyes
15,01Do test the bounds that mortal minds endure
15,01When time's slow hand doth give not hope, but ties
15,01The youthful heart that ought run free and pure

15,01Tis pain that youthful hearts do fear to love
15,01Though oft has time no other choice to give
15,01When time and hate resolve to push and shove
15,01Lovers can see no better way to live.

15,01But time and hate's dark hand can never hold
15,01The timeless love that springs from you and I
15,01The pain that glides across the earth so bold
15,01Recoils when love's soft wings do touch the sky.

15,01Though hate and pain may
15,01prove to last through time
15,01E'er more will I be yours and you be mine.
