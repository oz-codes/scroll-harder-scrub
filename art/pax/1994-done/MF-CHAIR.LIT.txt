15,01The Empty Chair

15,01The Chair sets cold, barren, bleak,
15,01gloomy, and lifeless, in a room
15,01where nothing of such nature 
15,01ought to be.  Al and I turn
15,01to each other nodding at
15,01the realization that
15,01perhaps our greatest fear is
15,01unfolding before our very
15,01eyes.  The beat will not instill
15,01purpose, nor the music evoke
15,01emotion.  Life grows meaningless
15,01as we contemplate what is 
15,01happening.  Attitudes become
15,01nonchalant; smiles are wiped away,
15,01and laughter and fun cease
15,01existence.  All eyes focus on 
15,01the site where Colleen, bearer
15,01of life's riches, ought to be.
15,01There is nothing, however, 
15,01except a vacant
15,01Empty Chair.
