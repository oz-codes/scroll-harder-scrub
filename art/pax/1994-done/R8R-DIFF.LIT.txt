15,01"DIFFERENCES?"

15,01Last Night, on the TV, I saw a man.
15,01A Murderer. A Killer.
15,01I looked at him. I studied him.
15,01What did I see?

15,01I saw a man, not unlike myself.
15,01He had 2 ears and 2 eyes, a mouth and a nose.
15,012 arms, legs and 10 fingers and toes.
15,01He was, on the outside, a man. A human being like me.

15,01Yes, we have similar bodies,
15,01THAT I have already stated.
15,01But do the similarities end there?
15,01What about the people INSIDE of us.

15,01Being men, HUMAN men, we MUST share similar feelings.
15,01We Hate some people.  We love some people.
15,01We can be frightened and we can be brave.
15,01We both have goals and desires.

15,01The only difference I could see?
15,01HE KILLED ANOTHER MAN, ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
15,01For a reason or not, he took a life.
15,01And THAT is what scares me MOST.

15,01How can we be so simliar,
15,01yet so different at the same tim?
15,01Could something have caused him to act that way?
15,01Could something cause ME to act that way?

15,01Some people beleive that there is a line
15,01between normal and abnormal. 
15,01Sanity and Insanity.
15,01Or IS there?

15,01What could push that man across this so called line?
15,01What could ME across this co called line?
15,01What could push ANYONE, be it man, woman,
15,01or child across this so called line?

15,01Is there a difference between one person and another?
15,01I pray there is.
15,01For the world's sake.
15,01NO...  for MY sake.
