15,01Welcome to another edition of REM INC. Monthly.

15,01Another month another packet.  This pack has a little more
15,01ansi's.  Why?  We have several new REM TRIALS this month.
15,01Like to give my shots out to them.  Another new REM INC.
15,01Central Headquarters.  "Exodus" also the Central Hq. For
15,01STATICNET.  He will be here to stay.  The sysop Dotar Sojat,
15,01SPAZM member and REM Affil. will head the REM/SP Couriers.
15,01Starting this month.  This course will help REM INC. get
15,01stronger as a group.  And he is also looking over STATICNET.

15,01A loss of a US Headquarters.  The rumor that Dark Atlantis
15,01is staying down for good, might be true.  I haven't been
15,01able to reach Cesspool at all.  We'll find out soon enough.
15,01So my new USHQ is The Shaolin Temple.  Lord Musashi over at
15,01TST/415 has helped alot.  Three coders and one artist for 
15,01REM INC. makes TST home.  Now thinking who is going
15,01to replace the Western HQ status.  One thought in mind was
15,01Sub Tropic Abyss an REM/SP Member board.  But I will give
15,01it more time.  

15,01We are still looking for more members!  Can you draw?
15,01Can you compose?  Can you code?  Then get over here and
15,01give REM INC a try.  OH, I MENTIONED IN THE LAST PACK
15,01I WOULD GIVE THE NEW INFO FOR REM DIVISION SITES.
15,01Well here they are: Your board must be 100 % ART
15,01                    OR half art and half warez.
15,01                    And lastly.  Your board must   
15,01                    be up for 6 months!  Mention 
15,01                    that in the application!
15,01                    OH AND CHECK IF THERE ARE
15,01                    TWO SITES ALREADY IN YOUR
15,01                    A/C.
