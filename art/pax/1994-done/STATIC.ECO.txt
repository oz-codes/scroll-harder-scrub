15,01StaticNet will only go up to 43 bases.  As time goes on we will be deleting
15,01or adding bases.  Thus being a number system(tagnames/base #'s) it is easier
15,01for me to slide bases in and out of the network.  If you want to add a base
15,01to StaticNet you must sponsor that base, and if found worthy you shall keep
15,01it.  But if not we will delete it due to lack of participation.

15,01StaticNet is fairly new so the quality of messages has not been established
15,01at this point.  No rules have not yet been conducted.  We will learn as we
15,01go along.  I do encourage QUALITY messages.  Give us a shot. BTW: this net
15,01does not guarantee anything it is for the reading and viewing pleasure of
15,01the Underground Community.

15,01StaticNet is a division of REM INC.
15,01REM INC member boards are encourage to apply.
