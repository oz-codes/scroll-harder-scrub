15,01I can almost remember the touch of her hands,
15,01a memory that sends a shiver up my spine.
15,01Not that a shiver up your spine is a bad thing,
15,01it's just the reaction I get from that memory.

15,01She looks up at you and you have to stop.
15,01She has this smile on her face and you look down and you see her smile.
15,01And you stop and smile.
15,01You're lost and nothing really matters.
15,01You've got this smile to remember.
15,01You kick the pillow but it doesn't hurt.
15,01Don't forget, you've got this smile to remember.
15,01You don't think of anything
15,01you don't concentrate at all
15,01someone may be calling you

15,01but who cares.
15,01There's a smile to remember.

15,01You touch her hair.
15,01It really isn't that long.
15,01You look into her eyes,
15,01her glasses are somewhere in the room,
15,01it's dark... you're lost in her eyes.
15,01Blue.. dark blue. very dark blue
15,01You thought they were black.
15,01You touch her face,
15,01it was just an accidental brushing.
15,01Her smile is gone, she's now biting her lip.

15,01You look down again.
15,01This person is so... WOW
15,01and then you kiss her.
15,01Your eyes are now closed, you don't know why though.
15,01So you open them
15,01and you look
15,01and you see
15,01and you look into her eyes.
15,01Her eyes are open too.
15,01You're still kissing

15,01but you're locked in a secretive gaze.

15,01Your hand moves, but not by your own doing.
15,01She's taken your hand into hers...
15,01You pull back from your kiss.
15,01You look down again.
15,01Her eyes are glossy... almost a lost look.
15,01Probably the same look you're giving her.
15,01Then you kiss her again, you've gone for her neck.
15,01A gentle moan... then louder.
15,01Breathing.
15,01No other sound.
