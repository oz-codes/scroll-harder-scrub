15,01Hi, this is King Arthur here, bringing you my newest S3M "Below Your Feet."
15,01This tune was written over a period of two weeks or so.  It was worked on
15,01furiously at first, then I kinda drifted away, and back, and so on.  So,
15,01if a part doesn't quite sound like it goes with the rest of it, don't worry
15,01about it.  hehehe

15,01Greetings go out to:  All the members of FIRE, the group I'm now in; Night
15,01Owl, Quicksilver, Black Wolf, Vanth, Kamikaze, Fistandantilus, Tiamat, and 
15,01anyone that I forgot...  Hey!

15,01Also, DON'T call my BBS. It's was called Camelot and it WAS at (404)428-5227.  
15,01It's GONE!  No more BBS!  Don't call it!  Hehehe, Later!


15,01Can ya feel it?  I can feel it...
