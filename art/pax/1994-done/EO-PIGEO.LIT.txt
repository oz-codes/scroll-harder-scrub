15,01Pigeon Park

15,01I rode my bike through the park one day
15,01It was a sunny morning, a morning in May
15,01And then I saw them, strutting about
15,01I saw a whole crowd, and gave a joyous shout!

15,01"Pigeons!" I yelled at the flock of grey
15,01The pigeons looked up, and fluttered away
15,01Only to land four feet from me
15,01It was an oppurtunity, can't you see?

15,01So I geared up my bike and plowed on through
15,01The poor bird-brained things didn't know what to do
15,01Some fluttered, some hopped, some flew at me
15,01Some flapped their small wings and retreated to a tree.

15,01I felt power, the power of gods
15,01Making them tremble, the poor lousy clods
15,01I was due at school; I didn't care
15,01I turned my bike with a sophisticated air.

15,01And there I waited, watching them all
15,01As they fluttered back into a group, I stood tall
15,01And waited for my chance, with devilish glee
15,01When they'd all settled down and forgot about me.

15,01The time had come, fifty pigeons were silent
15,01I pushed my pedals, my intentions all violent
15,01And raced through their midst with power and flair
15,01I ran over a few, but what did I care?

15,01The pigeons regrouped; with flutters of grey
15,01I watched them from behind a tree, chuckling away
15,01For as soon as the females were nodding off
15,01I gave a loud and precise cough

15,01And oh! the outraged pigeons took wing
15,01Startled from sleep by a coughing thing
15,01A human, no less, making their lives sad
15,01As they flew off, I noted, boy, were they mad!

15,01They landed seconds later just tweleve feet away
15,01As if from there they'd be safe from me, nay!
15,01I wasn't done yet, so I left my old bike
15,01By the tree, and began a creeping small hike

15,01I made it, ducking from tree to tree
15,01'Til finally, I was there, and they hadn't seen me
15,01I crouched low like a cat, ready to pounce
15,01And then my body uncurled, and I gave a great bounce!

15,01Into the midst of their happy group
15,01I landed on them, and made pigeon soup
15,01They squawked and they squawked, but I didn't go 'way
15,01I sat on them all, 'til the green grass was grey

15,01Grey with feathers, from each birdie-friend
15,01I got off, a helping hand to lend
15,01Each was dazed and angry at me
15,01I helped them all up, good-natured, you see

15,01They were all so subdued; I began to feel bad
15,01I'd murdered their flock-mates, and made them all mad
15,01But out of fifty, there were still forty-five
15,01"Hey," I thought, "at least some are alive!"

15,01The pigeons didn't see things my way
15,01I wanted to leave, backed out of the fray
15,01But they formed a circle of grey around me
15,01And they looked as murderous as pigeons could be!

15,01I tried to escape, but oh! they were fast
15,01I donned my jacket, to make my skin last
15,01From their blows, sharp tiny beaks
15,01My skin will be full of holes for weeks

15,01I headed for my bike; they got there first
15,01And by the time I'd arrived, they'd done their worst
15,01The gears were broken, the spokes all bent
