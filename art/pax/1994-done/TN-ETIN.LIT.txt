15,01Eternally Insane

15,01insanity is in every aspect of your life
15,01everything you dream, you cannot have
15,01struggling to make sense as to why
15,01slowly realizing it's the world around you
15,01a world that does not want you for anything else but to cause you pain
15,01a insane world that has ruined you, your hopes and dreams
15,01you let it happen, no matter how much you deny it
15,01you know it's true
15,01your grip of a false reality becomes stronger
15,01wanting so much to leave this cruel one for yours
15,01it won't happen, it can't happen, this world won't let you
15,01it's having too much fun wiht you
15,01as you try and fail we'll contiue laughing
15,01laughing at your poor excuse for an existance
15,01the only true escape is when you become
15,01eternally insane...
