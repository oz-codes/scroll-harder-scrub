02,01I sat outside on the front porch one night,
02,01Watched the stars radiate a gentle light,
02,01Mystical inner peace stroking me inside,
02,01Nothing to hold me back, I felt I had to abide.
02,01My eyes soon tired, leaving now seemed too tragic,
02,01I let myself drift into the realm of magic,
02,01A cascade of water slowly rolled, dripped off my face,
02,01The pure liquid, such a cold, crystalline taste.
02,01I looked up and was greeted by a waterfall,
02,01Bubbling white foam, powder towering tall,
02,01I bent down on one knee and peered into the bubbles,
02,01I smiled into the water, reflecting shimmering doubles.
02,01The serenity of this painting seemed implanted,
02,01Never to be forgotten, never again to be granted,
02,01I cherished the moment for a while longer,
02,01It seemed so exquisite, it seemed so much stronger.
02,01I had to let it go, this gentle escape from the night,
02,01Eyelids slowly, unwillingly opened, all was right,
02,01The water, the bubbles, gone when I entered the rift,
02,01I felt so warm, I had grown the seed of my God-given gift.
