15,01Welcome back, finally, to the third installment of
15,01visual insanity. A lot of things have happened in 
15,01the past two months. Handle changes, site changes, 
15,01new policies, etc, etc...  So lets get started...

15,01New/Old Members.
15,01 I don't know what's going on, but since our last pack 
15,01came out, there seems to have been a handle changing  
15,01frenzy going through modem land.  I'd imagine that in 
15,01a group with 50+ members, 2 or so would change their 
15,01handle (i can't imagine why they's change to Shaggy and 
15,01Elisdee, but that's none of my concern:).  Anyway, within 
15,01our little group of about 17 or so, 3 members have 
15,01changed handles.  Necromancer after holding his name 
15,01since he started modeming, changed to Cygnus, found 
15,01out there was another Cygnus out there, and changed again 
15,01to Leviathan (don't ask ME), which he will stay with.
15,01Tron, having had a quite overused handle decided to 
15,01Thadicus would give a more accurate connotation of his 
15,01inner self.:) And, finally, a big producer this month, 
15,01Jackyl, has changed to Number 25.
15,01 Lurgee will be inactive for the time being, he's out 
15,01partying for the summer.  Awakened Earth has gone down 
15,01with Lurgee.  This time permamently.  *I* expect to see 
15,01Lurgee and AE back in full swing come summers end. (He'll 
15,01run out of money, therefore run out of pot, therefore 
15,01come back to sanity, therefore put AE back 
15,01up.):)
15,01 New members this (2) month[s] are Crimson Overlord in the
15,01coding division, Perkman in the VGA division, and Pyromaniac
15,01in the courior division.
