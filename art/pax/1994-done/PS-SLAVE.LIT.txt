15,01                               Our Own Slavery


15,01Little by little we eat away
15,01Our souls, gnawing them to the very core
15,01Slaves of our own creation
15,01No man is free...

15,01You can set aside your hopes, dreams
15,01For as long as you live
15,01You hold yourself back from the point of recognition
15,01Eyes blind to the truth...

15,01No man is created equal
15,01Bonded to our own nightmares
15,01We place ourselves above all
15,01Those who wish to help us...

15,01Slavery enforced
15,01Addicted to losing
15,01No chance in Hell
15,01That we'll even try to save ourselves...

15,01Drugs, Sex, Death, 
15,01Even The absolute love of Life
15,01Hold us back, make us numb
15,01Wake up, shake off your bonds...

15,01Imminent Death is our only 
15,01Salvation, freed from our
15,01Worldly bonds, only then
15,01Shall we know Peace...

15,01Belief gives us hope
15,01Yet, hope hold us back
15,01From doing what is needed
15,01Always hoping someone else will...

15,01Open you eyes, see
15,01The truth, there is no
15,01Getting around it, we are stuck
15,01In the traps of our minds...

15,01Loss of life brings an even
15,01Newer life, a life without
15,01Slavery and hate
15,01Death greets us all...

15,01Remeber my words, for you shall find them true the next time you
15,01look in the mirror and see that you are not what you wish you could
15,01be.. The only hope in this life is the warm kiss of death..
15,01Someday all shall see...
