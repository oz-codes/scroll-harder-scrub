04,01B13i08t00chin' ANSi Design once again shoves  another  BAD Pack at your face and s08a13y04s
04,01"13L08o00ok,  ma,  I got this killer shit just now!" It's a pretty small pack.    08O13k04.
04,01Y13o08u 00got me.  It's a really small pack, but do you see the look of concern on 13m04y
04,01f13a08c00e?  It's summer, so byte me.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy it because that's 08a13l04l
04,01y13o08u00r gonna get this month.

04,01W13h08y 00is this pack so small?   Why wasn't there a pack last month?   Why are y08o13u04r
04,01h13e08m00orhoids  flaring up again?   All these answers AND MORE can be found in t08h13i04s
04,01w13e08e00k's Weekly World News on the page after the Elvis, JFK and Hitler story.

04,01W13e 00gained a new member this month,  Death Karnage.   The bad part is,  he's 08n13o04t
04,01D13e08a00th Karnage.   Yeah, I know, that sounds real weird but it's not really.   13H04e
04,01c13h08a00nged his handle,  but I did write down what it was and I also lost his vo08i13c04e
04,01n13u08m00ber.   So,  if anyone knows any of that info, tell him to call me or call 13m04e
04,01y13o08u00rself.  On the bad side, we lost one of our best artists this month, LiQU08i13D04.
04,01H13e 00is leaving the scene for a  while  "Somewhere between a month and a year" 13s04o
04,01a13s 00soon as he's back,  I'm sure everyone will welcome  him  with  open  arms08.13.04.
04,01R13I08G00HT!?!  In addition, Thadicus left us...   again.  He's currently hanging 08o13u04t
04,01a13t 00Vi...   again.   However,  I hear that Vi has merged with another group,  13s04o
04,01h13o08p00efully  we'll  see  some  stuff  coming  from that area soon.   That's it 13o04n
04,01m13e08m00bership stuff.

04,01N13u08m00ber Cruncher and I got off our lazy ass's and did a loader this month.  I08t13'04s
04,01p13r08e00tty cool,  but a little hard to read  because I went a little silly with 08t13h04e
04,01f13o08n00t.  It looked fine when all the letters were lined up in alphabetical ord08e13r04,
04,01r13e08a00lly,  it did!   It doesn't even have a MOD,  so it should work on just ab08o13u04t
04,01a13n08y 00system with relative speed.  Enjoy the "fireworks"!

04,01I13f 00you'd like to join BAD,  please do.   We'd really like to see some more A08N13S04i
04,01a13r08t00ists hop over and join us, so if you like what you see, come on down!

04,01W13h08a00t?   What did I hear?  Where can you reach us?  Well, so nice of you to a08s13k04.
04,01Y13o08u 00can always reach any BAD member at the BAD WHQ,  The Chasm of  Doom  <pl08u13g04,
04,01p13l08u00g, plug>.  The number is in the SIT file.  Some of us are also active on 08t13h04e
04,01I13n08t00erNet and also on IRC.   One of us (BKnight,  NCruncher,  Zodiac, Probe) 08c13a04n
