15,01Pack #4

15,01well, this is my all new form for the info file. I am just going to ramble
15,01on as I think of things to tell you and you'll have to figure out WHAT THE
15,01HELL I am trying to say. Anyway, welcome to Escape Pack #4. Lesse, ok.
15,01All sites, and I suppose member boards, MUST call out WHQ at 516.331.1851
15,01NOW and if they do NOT pick up our net and POLL it like twice a week, you're
15,01not gonna be getting the packs. Ok, so all sites are STILL sites. We will not
15,01be couriering to YOU anymore though. (at least not in the near future) since
15,01our couriers are all retired. :( If you decide to take our net, you would
15,01be calling to poll so at the same time you could download the current pack
15,01on your time. Anyhow, call, talk to our prez, get the net, remain an active
15,01site. What else is new? New members... Reznor, formerly of Imperial has 
15,01joined us. He will be doing VGA, ANSI, and musak for us. Check out his 1st
15,01S3M file in this pack. ZooKeeper also joined us. Zorba formerly of Mag is
15,01here as an excellent VGA artist. Our friend, Dr Nack out in CA is getting us
15,01more talent, and we assume that they will be joining us shortly but until we
15,01see their work, they aren't members. (Officially) Superman, formerly of Mag,
15,01joined us for like 2 weeks, and quit already. He and Zorba made a nice loader
15,01so its in here. mmmm other things? Oh yes, there is a GIF format member list 
15,01from now on. If there are any errors, let us know please. The sites are listed 
15,01on the ansi member list for this month - next month they won't be listed at 
15,01all.
