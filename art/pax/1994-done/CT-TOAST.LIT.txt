15,01  01S   P   A   M   -why is this always in hidden text? who knows...
15,01       For months and months, it 00seems, I've kept a calm and fir15m defiance
15,01               Against a shiny l00ittle cynical electrical applia15nce
01,01This is the hidden verse:15                     01i'm so glad i discovered hidden
15,01              At first, its on00ly purpose was to heat my stale 15bread     01text
15,01           And yet as time we00nt on, its only wish became to 15see me dead
01,01Past the kitchen I walked by15                                        01(for those
15,01              It started in00nocently, with barbed wire on t15he toast  01dumb-heads
15,01           But as time wen00t on, its goal to see me dead b15ecame foremost  01out
01,01Its power cord wrapped 'round my thigh15                                   01there:
15,01           One day, whil00e waiting for my toast, it shot 15it out so hard01it's black
15,01           I had to fin00d safe cover from the whole-gra15in wheat bombard01on black!)
01,01I felt a tug, my feet did fly
15,01               My toa00ster plugged itself into an ele15ctronic socket
15,01       And chased me 00'round, with cherry flames, ju15st like a toasty rocket
01,01I tumbled, bruised, but did not die.
15,01             One n00ight, I was aroused out of a de15ep and restful sleep
15,01             By t00he touch of clammy metal crawli15ng under my bedsheet
01,01(And heard a deep metallic sigh)  Call The Screaming Tomato
15,01        I was d00isturbed to find, while calmly 15soaking, dangling in the tub
15,01             A 00slightly dampened smoking spar15king simple toaster plug
15,01                                       01(604)980-8805! My board!
15,01             00At last, one day, I had to kno15w, the reason for its hate
01,01Cthulu15        00The ever-driving passion tha15t it had to make me "late"
01,01(should be spelt Cthulhu, but how many Lovecraft fans are there out there?)
15,01             00I tied it up, turned out th15e lights, began interrogating
01,01FIsh heads    00It said, "I'm mighty jeal15ous of your higher PH rating"
01,01Fish heads
01,01roly poly    00I said, "That isn't it a15t all, you lousy damned machine00"
01,01fish heads  00It cried, "There was a c15ontract for you in A.C.E magazi00ne"
01,01Fish heads
01,01fish heads 00I said "Stop spouting l15ies, the honest truth is what I 00need!"
01,01Eat them up  00"I know as well as y15ou that simple toasters cannot 00read!"
01,01Yum.15       01(thanks to Barnes and Barnes)
15,01       00I slapped it hard, it ye15lled "All right, I'll tell the 00reason why,"
15,01              00"I wanted you to 15teach me how a man like you ca00n cry"

15,01         00I sneered, "3 strik15es,", and boxed it up, and sent 00it to Quebec14,
15,01         00and thought, "My p15roblem's gone! Now it'll make E00ERIE a wreck!"

15,01            00With glee I w15ent back home and went back to 00my normal life
15,01             00I never eve15n saw that fateful blender with 00the knife...
