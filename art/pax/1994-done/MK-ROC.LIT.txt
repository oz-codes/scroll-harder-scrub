15,01         00The storm swirled and snarled outside, but he sung of gods paid no
00,01heed   His long curtain of raven-jet hair curled at the corners of his cynic's
00,01face  He and all else, knew that he stood alone  Then again there was the
00,01screaming, meaningless procession called life to keep him company  He
00,01grinned at the attempts of architects, attempting to make perfect geometries of
00,01sides and volume, attemptin  to stave off the incurable  All was formless,
00,01meaningless  An honest man has just as much chance being right as he does
00,01of being wrong  But he embraced what others faced blindly, unknowingly
00,01He used it to his advantage  a ruler of chaos
15,01         00How ironic  the next to join him a paragon of purity   t'was he who
00,01touched the Holy Grail when all others failed, even the great Launcelot Du
00,01Lake  Yet, how fitting, for he sung of gods knew that though he embraced the
00,01chaos, he could not tell it where to lay and eddy  A slow grin crept across
00,01his chapped lips as fair paragon's alabaster armor shone like spots of
00,01white-flashing sulfur  His helmet framed his smooth and unmarred features
00,01like an eagle's crest  paragon's grin was one of pure empathy and consideration,
00,01foiling the other's sarcasm and cynicism  But both grinned nonetheless, and
00,01allied  a ruler of chaos
15,01         00A black feathered fowl of yore aawked off at the horizon's edge  It
00,01seemed feral brown animal, a weasel, had hissed and stared and held him at
00,01impasse  The bird bared the tiny ridge of sharp nubs on its beak as its dander
00,01and neck-feathers flared open and it aawked louder and more rhythmically  It
00,01was only a matter of scant moments before the brown-furred creature darted its
00,01retreat, its eyes pin-prick red and hateful, and a sick, dying hiss escaping
00,01from its curled maw  The large black-feathered waterfowl flapped hard thrice
00,01and glided with determined effort onto a cushion of air, then sailed with
00,01ease over to the first two rulers  Aawk  He was gladly accepted  They became a
00,01focus of three, ringed in rank and purpose  a ruler of chaos
