15,01        Krystal View, otherwise known as K-View, is the newest addition to the
15,01 ANSI viewers that have been released by iCE.  It is a versitile, but easy to
15,01 use viewer.  The options and features are:

15,01 1) ANSI Scrolling (Up & Down Arrows)
15,01         A simple but not always included feature, you can scroll back in an
15,01         ANSI.

15,01 2) Mouse support
15,01         Self explanitory.

15,01 3) ANSI display speed changing ("+" & "-" keys)
15,01         The display speed can be changed from 0 to 10.

15,01 4) Text or VGA mode viewing ("V" toggles)
15,01         ANSI's can be viewed in both regular text mode or in, 320x200, VGA
15,01         mode.

15,01 5) 50 line mode ANSI viewing in both text and VGA mode ("F" toggles)
15,01         ANSI's can be viewed in text 50 line mode and "to-scale" VGA,
15,01         320x200, VGA mode.

15,01 6) Animated ANSI viewing in both text and VGA mode ("A" toggles)
15,01         Animated ANSI's can be viewed in reglar text and in, 320x200,  VGA
15,01         mode. (VGA mode does go just as fast as text mode).

15,01 7) File directory & file extension changing ability ("P")
15,01         Files with any extension can be viewed by K-View, and directorys
15,01         can be changed within K-View.

15,01 8) Wrap Around Mode
15,01         ANSi's viewed in VGA mode can also be viewed with the ansi wraping
15,01         around on the screen instead of scrolling in a column.  This is
15,01         MUCH faster. It can be toggled with the letter 'W'.

15,01 9) Extension Switch
15,01         K-View loads up as a deafault finding files with the extension *.ICE
15,01         but can now also be loaded with a switch from dos.  IE: 'KV *.ANS'.

15,01 Note:  The reason that 320x200 VGA mode is used rather than 640x480 VGA mode
15,01        is that 320x200 VGA mode is an EXACT scale down from regular text
15,01        mode, unlike 640x480.
