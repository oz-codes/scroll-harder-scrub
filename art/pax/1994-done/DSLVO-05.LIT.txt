15,01Sly Moves - An Alternate View of Reality

15,01          I cannot see the faces of the dead as they lay in their

15,01graves.  I cannot see their souls, I cannot feel their touch.  

15,01But I can see one thing, and it sits in the back of my mind.  A 

15,01token to the underworld, a sign, a shallow tear on my cheek.


15,01          Black.


15,01          A colour, for sure.  But the black penetrates my mind, 

15,01burning my retinas with haunting sorrow.  The everlasting, all 

15,01consuming black, the nighttime, the murky shadow.  I see into the

15,01black pools of the weeping and I feel.  I feel for the death.  

15,01Death that hangs in the air like smoke.  Cigarette smoke perhaps? 

15,01The choking, noxious destruction of so many unearthly 

15,01carcinogens.  A pinch of arsenic, a dash of tar.  Maybe a cupful 

15,01of ether along with a puff of zyklon-B?  And most of all, lest I 

15,01forget, the stony grip of nicotine, that wonderful element that 

15,01we cannot forget, nor leave alone.  Can you see the black?  Can 

15,01you taste it in the air, polluting your lungs, corrupting your 

15,01soul, breaking the back of the family you seek to protect.  Can 

15,01you gaze into the onyx eyes of a shark and not feel your essence 

15,01mashed like an insect?  I can, and I have.  I have felt the 

15,01effects of your proclamation, Prime Minister, and I feel the 

15,01black.


15,01          I am the pawn, the prey, the game.  A roll of the dice 

15,01decides my future, my future as a victim.  A victim.  Your so 

15,01called solution to the cigarette smuggling problem is, sparing no

15,01words, a joke.  In our market based, democratic society, our 
15,01fuel, our driving force is the dollar.  The tax reductions will 

15,01not produce less 18 wheelers crossing the borders, but an 

15,01increase in very thing we fear the most.  The black.  Death.  

15,01Since when do we combat a problem with a problem?  Are we so 

15,01infatuated with our own public image that we are willing to 

15,01sacrifice the blood, the purity, the future of a broken nation to

15,01the addiction of cigarettes?  I say yes.  This utterly 

15,01contemptible, vulgar display of power has left me sour to the 

15,01government, and lo! to you, gentle reader, that you may share in 

15,01my bitter hoard.


15,01          I may be a victim, but for sure, I know that no 

15,01situation is static.  Change is brought about by change, and I 

15,01know that I can keep stewing, keep smoking like cheap Montreal
