15,01   14The city  sweats beneath  the blazing August sun.  Asphalt rivers bend and
14,01   heave, flowing with stagnant dreams and ambitions.  Shattered lives litter
14,01   the sidewalks, swirl and  spin in the hot wind, and disappear.  Monumental
14,01   concrete  spires  reach out to caress  the sky; forever reaching,  forever
14,01   yearning.  A jaundice haze  tightly embraces the city, its stifling weight
14,01   sapping the very life out of the ground. Overhead the malevolent sun grows
14,01   weary  of the steel  and concrete  and slowly retires  toward the  distant
14,01   horizon.  Dusk  descends, the towering buildings carving deep shadows into
14,01   the battered  ground.  This world,  cast in relief,  begins to  awaken  as
14,01   darkness falls.  While  hidden beneath the  mask of  night  the city seems
14,01   not so stark, not  so devoid of hope.  Tiny stars  glitter and shimmer but
14,01   these are not the stars in the skies above - they have long been drown out
14,01   by the  man-made stars  which  twinkle  and flash on  every street,  every
14,01   corner. In years gone by man looked to the stars and dreamed of possessing
14,01   the power of creation. Yet these synthetic stars tell only of dreams never
14,01   realized, ambitions long forgotten.  It's at these times  that I stare out
14,01   my window on  the cold, grey city and it seems  the whole world has turned
14,01   to rust...
