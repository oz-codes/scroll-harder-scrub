15,01@SONG: lost secret

15,01religion's, a crutch for the shackled.
15,01led by the arm, lead on a sled.
15,01downhill existence,
15,01perpetuated by greed and pestilence.

15,01                freedom won with courage,
15,01                recharged happiness with age,
15,01                the old ones, they've got it,
15,01                the lost secret.

15,01governments, corrupted.  spewing lies,
15,01ideas, norms, trends.  twist ties,
15,01writhing, holding me down,
15,01wrapped around me like a gown.

15,01corporates' idea plowing the able,
15,01factory direct, financing available.
15,01into a tightly woven bag, on a different plane,
15,01overflowing, underfed entity totally insane.

15,01                freedom won with courage,
15,01                recharged happiness with age,
15,01                the old ones, they've got it,
15,01                the lost secret.

15,01the human animal's a civilized mammal,
15,01ready to follow, existance is banal.
15,01emptiness enhanced,
15,01reason's unbalananced.
