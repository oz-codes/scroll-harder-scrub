15,01why do you hurt me, ballerina?
15,01dance, dance, nce.

15,01i put her back and turn away.

15,01i will always remember her.
15,01tiny ballerina.





15,01Title: No answer to this Aborted thing.

15,01language is my limitation.
15,01poetic?
15,01words reduce the power of my thought.
15,01justice served not is to them when speak i form any them in.
15,01intentionally so written.

15,01music is freedom of thought.
15,01allowing more to be implied.
15,01but still
15,01the meaning is always lost.

15,01telepathy is too intrusive.
15,01mental rape.
15,01another persons mind would be like a
15,0112 inch dick
15,01being thrust into my uninviting vagina.

15,01anger.
15,01sex.
15,01laughter.
15,01pure emotions are a beautiful form of expression of thought
15,01but they are too socially unacceptable.

15,01you touch her hand.
15,01you close your hand around hers and bring it close to your chest.
15,01a sigh... then you become aware of your breathing.
15,01it rushes against your ears. sounds like...

15,01you can hear the howls from the seagulls.
15,01perched upon the sand, you throw a rock into the sea.
15,01it touches sand. missed the sea by a mile.

15,01a sniffle brings you back to the hand on your heart.
15,01her eyes flutter as you breath into her face.. lightly.
15,01a tear forms and falls from her eye tracing out the curves in her face.

15,01but

15,01i can't comfort you.
15,01i am my own self and deal with it in whatever way i can.
15,01my words usually fall upon deaf ears.
15,01fall upon blind eyes.
15,01fall out of numb li.

15,01stumbling across the room, I scan the horizon for my seat.
15,01near to the left of the back of the brightly lit and somewhat annoying room.
15,01i'm intercepted.
