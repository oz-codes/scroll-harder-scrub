15,01     00"You're OK kid, you're gonna be fine! You can go through the door or you

00,01can stay here and play with us. You passed the test."

15,01     00When Timmy rose from the ground, he saw that everything had restored to a

00,01normal, more appropriate color. The large door now reflected his own image. He

00,01looked at himself, he was healthy, but slightly transparent. John did not

00,01reflect. "Go through kid, you've earned your peace. I'll miss you." Little

00,01Timmy was too confused to respond, he simply stared at himself and tried to

00,01remember how he got here in the first place. One last glance was cast at John,

00,01who turned and faded away, saying in the background, "Good luck, kid."

15,01     00A single hand reached out, the palm facing away, the fingers extended.

00,01Timmy could not remember the last time he stood on his feet, unaided, unguarded.

00,01He looked around. The light cast on a gloomy scene, covered with with a bitter

00,01smelling mist. There was not a sound, save for the unceasing whir of the drill

00,01and an occasional thud sound of it encountering a hard substance. He looked at

00,01the scene: it was himself, on a white table. Dark red stains spread near his

00,01head, the drill boring steadily through his skull. No voices, but Timmy could

00,01see the EKG, it was flatline. He worried now as the doctor ceased drilling, all

00,01of the people assembled around him looked up at the large analog clock, and then

00,01down at their own watches. It was over. But no sooner had Timmy thrust his hands

00,01toward the image, than had the image simply faded from the mist. Now, all that

00,01remained was the mirror and the light. It called, soothed, calmed. The light was

00,01pure and warm, and Timmy sensed that there were answers in the light, but he

00,01also remembered his friends in the mirror; they were back there, back in the

00,01fun place.

15,01     00Soft voices caressed Timmy's mind. All he could see here were the soothing

00,01tones of the light. He wanted the light, sought it, there was warmth and peace

00,01in the light, a calm satisfaction he had never known before. But just as Timmy

00,01was about to step into the light, he fought back another tiny, miniscule voice

00,01calling out to him from the mirror. "You're OK kid, we'll miss you..." Timmy

00,01had never really had many friends; John was the closest thing he had. John

00,01didn't seem to mind that Timmy wasn't perfect. And with all the pain and sorrow

00,01he had known, the mirror looked more and more like a really great place to be.

15,01     00Timmy's mind was made up. He stepped away from the light. Surrounded by

00,01the dissolute mist of his death, he walked toward the mirror. His face distorted

00,01quite concerting in the image as it smiled at him in return. He knew there was

00,01no turning back. Despite all of the answers and warmth in the light, his mind

00,01needed to be set free, to play. A single hand outstretched into the liquid

00,01surface of the mirror. His fingers felt a strange chill as his hand submerged

00,01in the smooth mirror up to the wrist. He smiled. No fear, just happiness and

00,01joy, he would get to play with his friends in the mirror, forever. He stepped
