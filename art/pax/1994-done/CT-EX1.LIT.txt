15,01The Experiment, Number One.

15,01I, Cthulu, recently began attending a writing workshop in my school... the
15,01program's called New Shoots, and at the end of the year, they take submissions
15,01from all the students in all the workshops in all the schools around here, and
15,01publish them in a little booklet, New Shoots. How appripriate.

15,01In any event, these are writings from the first session (we meet for periods
15,01of 3 hours every two weeks)... These examples were of being given a word or
15,01phrase, told, "Go!", and writing, frantically, for a set amount of time, to see
15,01what'd come out.

15,01We were also given some tips on writing... such as...

15,011 - Don't let the monkey man tie you down. (Wha?)
15,01        The monkey man is the part of your mind that wants to go back and make
15,01        everything perfect immediately. The part that tries to produce
15,01        completed products in one stage. When you're writing in exercises such
15,01        as these, that is a great hindrance.

15,012 - Keep the pencil moving.
15,01        If you slow down, you might not be able go get back up to steam.

15,013 - Make it interesting.
15,01        If you aren't surprising yourself, you won't be surprising the readers.

15,01And other such wonderful juicy quotes.

15,01In these two examples, I was given the phrases "While running through Pacific
15,01Centre in my underwear...", and "Cheese.".

15,01It is interesting to see how much, yet how little, one can churn out in what
15,01seems at the same time a pitifully small yet humongous amount of time.

15,01Read on...

15,01Timed Writing 1 - Session 1

15,013 minutes

15,01While runing through Pacific Centre in my underwear, pursued by security
15,01guards, I barely left a small slice of my conciousness open to go over the
15,01facts again which had left me in this situation. It had started innocently
15,01enough, pulling up, parking, even making a note of which of the many hallowed
15,01subterranean chambers my preferred mode of transportation, a VW Beetle with
15,01actual patches of paint showing on top of the heavily rusted exterior, was
15,01parked. In any event, I was here to exchange something. Something so
15,01spectacularly ugly...


15,01(time out. stop here... at some point in the future, we might elaborate on
15,01these.)

15,01Timed Writing 2 - Session 1

15,015 minutes

15,01"Cheese!", she exclaimed, with a hungry twinkle in her ravenous eyes. "I beg
15,01to differ, Madam, as I am not cheese, but merely a related dairy biproduct. So
15,01please, I beg of you, put away the crackers and rest a civilised distance from
15,01me, that I might ferment in peace." She slowed, then ground to a halt, losing
15,01the demoniac fire which had spurred her movements. "Most sorry," she
15,01apologised pathetically, "I had mistaken you for someone else." "It happens all
15,01the time. Just leave me be." She wandered off, to congregate with more of her
15,01fellow social butterflies. Seriously, some people have no culture, unlike me.
15,01I possess a veritably thriving culture of bacterium and related yeasts and
15,01fungi. One would think it wouldn't be so hard to be a giant talking tub of
15,01yogurt.


15,01(just enough time to squeeze that pun in at the end.)

15,01In any event, for people interested in learning how to write stories, novels,
15,01or whatever, or simply for a fun exercise, get together one day, with a bunch
15,01of pencils, paper, food, and a timer... and see what comes out. Some of the
15,01results will be developable ideas. Others will be crap. But the process itself
15,01is great fun.
