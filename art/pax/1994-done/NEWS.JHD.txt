15,01Wewp, hFaze here with the second Jihad pack.  I've changed the labeling so live
15,01with it.  Well, what happened this month?  Not much really.  We got a few new
15,01guys that are pretty good and more are on the way.  Venom of VOR might join us
15,01if he gets more time.  I'm also bugging a few demo graphics masters to join. 
15,01Some people have told me that I make too many vgas.  Do I?  Well, I'm now 
15,01doing art for 4 different groups, so i guess that I am.  I'm getting away from
15,01bbs adds and exploring pure art.  No more freebies (excpet if i know you). So
15,01I'm charging $20 and up for vgas now.  Depends on what ya want.  I'll do a 
15,01logo for free.  Those take all of 10 minutes to do, so what charge?  Valgamon,
15,01your KoV vga is comming!  <I just have to get an idea for it :>  
15,01I've gotten some negative feedback about Quisling putting those photos into 
15,01the packs.  Frankly, pique moi.  Photograhy is an art too.  Thise month we've
15,01done it a bit differently.  I've taken his photos and edited them.  Look at
15,01QS-M1.GIF and see.  Turned out great.  
15,01Some people told me that the last pack wasn't that good, well READ THE FUCKING
15,01NFO FILE NEXT TIME LIKE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO!!!!  In it i said why the pack 
15,01wasn't that good.  Go back and read it.  As Jihad grows, the packs will get 
15,01better.  I give us until JIHAD-5.ZIP untill we have the VGA scene in our grasp.
15,01Yes I'm that confident (I hope).  We are getting better vgas every month.  
15,01The Jihad will rule, oh yes (Tiny-zee...you don't ;).  
15,01Distros.  Ah the joys of running a group:  sysops begging to be distros.  Well,
15,01i've changed our policy a bit here.  From now on we're only have HQ's.  NO 
15,01DISTROS!  I mean, pple will upload stuff anywhere for file points so that they
15,01can get the latest VoR (plug) pack, so it will spread on it's own.  In the US 
15,01I'm having World, East, Central, and Western HQs.  I'm having one in Canada 
15,01and one Euro and one Mexican, etc.  Read the MEMLIST.JHD file to find out the
15,01HQs.  
15,01Viewer.  I dunno if I'm gonna have a viewer.  Well, Nivehn (sorry I don't 
15,01remember how to spell it :) said that he was gonna do me one, so hopefully
15,01we'll have one in the next pack.  How many gif viewers are there out there? I'm
15,01sure that you'll have NO troubles finding one.  
15,01Appgen.  Yeah, I'm definatly looking to get an appgen.  If you wanna code me 
15,01one then go for it.  
15,01Number of VGAs.  I know that there are not many VGAs here.  Reason.  Most 
15,01decent VGA artists are drowned with pple wanting them to do graphics for a 
15,01game that someone is doing.  Or am I the only one?  Also, VGAs are harder to
15,01do than lit, ansi, or ascii.  You can't do a 10minute VGA.  Can't.  And all of
15,01our artists are in other groups so Jihad is second priority.  
15,01What else?  Dunno.  Guess I'll add something If i feel like it.
15,01Oh yeah...if you wanna know what we're all about, check out POLICT.JHD.  Also
15,01if ya wanna join, check it too.

15,01Fin.
