15,01Praises

15,01The Gods
15,01Shed down flowers upon our days,
15,01Give blessing to the dawn,
15,01Voice their anger, 
15,01Love their servents,
15,01The dirt-

15,01Clouds form their words,
15,01Each is a different sylable of thought,
15,01And mankind runs to, and fro underneath,
15,01And the Gods will smile down on us-

15,01They smile because they are happy,
15,01God bless the light,
15,01God damn the darkness,
15,01Which has faded so far away,
15,01With the Gods to lull me asleep,
15,01I sleep in their praises-
