15,01LAST SOLDIER

15,01Booted feet through desert march,
15,01Instrument of death held ready.
15,01Searching for an enemy to kill,
15,01Footsteps long and steady.

15,01The sun bears down mercilessly;
15,01The desert shows no end.
15,01Still no sign of the enemy,
15,01But no sign of a friend.

15,01Where did all the people go?
15,01Where are all the trees?
15,01There are no more animals,
15,01No elephants, no fleas.

15,01He has searched for three long years,
15,01Across the wasted land.
15,01Through dead rainforests and mountain range,
15,01And now through desert sand.

15,01All he has found so far is death;
15,01Of an enemy, of a friend.
15,01No one is alive to greet him;
15,01Is this how the war shall end?

15,01He is the last soldier.
15,01His side wins, but at what cost?
15,01There is no one to celebrate victory.
15,01In reality, all have lost.

15,01He is all alone in the barren world;
15,01The last of a race long dead.
15,01There is no one left to kill,
15,01Or see him raise the gun to his head.
