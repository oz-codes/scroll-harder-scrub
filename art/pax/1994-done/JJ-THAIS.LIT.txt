15,01you.
15,01I love you
15,01stronger than anything.
15,01more wildly than you could imagine.
15,01stuff fairytales are made of...
15,01you.
15,01you leave me out of
15,01boredom and pain
15,01seek out newer
15,01more intense modes of existance.
15,01you.
15,01you come back.
15,01you tell me the only things you miss
15,01were how good I am in bed
15,01and fun I am to get stoned with.
15,01you kiss me and tell me
15,01it's completely meaningless.
15,01just an action.
15,01I smile to myself.. smug
15,01in the knowledge that it's impossible
15,01to make me feel like that without feeling
15,01*something*
15,01this goes on.
15,01I sacrifice some school..
15,01some friends..
15,01some sleep..
15,01some of myself..
15,01to be with you.
15,01you say we're
15,01'friends that fuck'
15,01I smile... she loves me.

15,01then I realize
15,01I'm a sucker.
15,01you weren't lying.
15,01how could I sell myself out so badly ?
15,01those actions were of pure emotion..
15,01I poured myself all over you
15,01for what ?
15,01so you could have a good time ?

15,01you say we're friends that fuck.
15,01it seems to me we're just fuckers.
15,01friends respect each other
15,01and the way I felt
15,01after you broke several promises
15,01cheerfully told me you forgot
15,01...
15,01how can that be considered the
15,01behaviour of a friend ?

15,01I know it's my fault for being so blind
15,01but you were aware
15,01of me
15,01and my feelings
15,01and you used words to warn me
15,01I laughed them off.. thinking
15,01we were still alike in our thinking.
15,01thinking that physical love can't be
15,01empty...

15,01you knew how I felt
15,01you kept going ?
15,01is the sex really *that* good ?
15,01does the size of my dick turn you on *that* much ?

15,01how cares about him .. he knows what he's getting into
15,01.
15,01It's my fault.
15,01I can't shift it.
15,01but the words..
15,01I just wouldn't listen..
15,01couldn't believe...

15,01you have changed.

15,01this would not have happened.
