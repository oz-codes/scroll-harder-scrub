15,01++
15,01+ rom long ago the legends tell,
15,01+ Of one born among the stars,
15,01Where in their beauty cast a spell,
15,01And christened this angel Israfel,
15,01The greatest of the bards.
15,01               x
15,01For his heart was cast in crystal pure,
15,01A thousand rivers were his blood,
15,01And while the sun and moon endure,
15,01No word has e'er been more true,
15,01Than that the beauty of his song brought still the stars above.
15,01               x
15,01And walking in the light of Heaven,
15,01His lute sang forth of stories old,
15,01And brought to tears dismal Pluto even,
15,01All hearts that beat under heaven,
15,01Never heard a song so bold.
15,01               x
15,01He sang of pain and lust and love,
15,01For a million dreams were his to know,
15,01Each note a crimson drop of blood,
15,01Falling from the skies above,
15,01To water earth below.
15,01               x
15,01Yet still his thoughts and bitter dreams,
15,01The songs could not outpour,
15,01For Israfel was one, it seems,
15,01One alone whose only means,
15,01Was to dream of Love, and yet no more.
15,01               x
15,01Ne'er to touch, ne'er to feel,
15,01Alone among the fields of Eden,
15,01Wishful longing to be real,
15,01From the stars his soul to steal,
15,01From the prison which was Heaven.
15,01               x
15,01To feel a heart beat in his chest,
15,01One of flesh and skin and bone,
15,01To bleed, to breath, walk among the blessed,
15,01A gentle hand to caress,
15,01And no more be alone.
15,01               x
15,01And thus he came on earth to dwell,
15,01To rest in Gaia's arms,
15,01Yet shall the angel sing so well,
15,01And the rivers which are his blood still swell,
15,01Without his saintly charms?
15,01               x
15,01Tell me, fallen son of Light,
15,01From wherein thy soul the songs still fly,
15,01Or have the tales of kings and knights,
15,01Succumbed to tales of desperate plight,
15,01Tell me, please, what is fancy to your eye?
15,01               x
15,01Israfel, where hast thou gone?
15,01Now that the stars no longer bow,
15,01Thy fiery dreams of passion flown,
15,01Thy fingers cast of dust and bone,
15,01No more than mortal now.
15,01               x
15,01Are thy heart-strings still a trembling lyre,
15,01Burning with Israfeli's fire?
15,01Alas, my soul thinks not.
