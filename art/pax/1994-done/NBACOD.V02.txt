15,01        Since everyone is in search of NBA Jam codes for the SNES or Genesis
15,01I figured I'd write up the codes for it.  If you already don't know how to
15,01use the hidden characters then please read this section:

15,01| Introduction |

15,01        Well welcome to the NBA Jam "Unofficial" Guide!  I hope you find
15,01this guide the best around!  Anyways lets get Jammin!

15,01| Differences |
15,01+--.... ....--+
15,01        Whats different about the SNES & Genesis versions of NBA Jam?
15,01All together they're more or less the same.  I've heard rumors that the 
15,01Genesis version has a Battery Backup, which makes it much better (?).
15,01The main difference here is that the hidden character/cheat codes are
15,01different.  Thus I can't release a "fully tested" guide b/c I don't have
15,01the Genesis version only the SNES one.  Anyway, the initials for the players
15,01are probably all the same... Have fun!

15,01| How to use the hidden characters |
15,01+--....                      ....--+
15,01        To use hidden characters you must enter the first 2 letters of the
15,01characters initials.  You then must goto the 3rd initial and Enter the code
15,01given.  For example if you wanted to play Air Dog, you would enter the letters
15,01AI And goto letter R you would then press <if using SNES> L START and X, the
15,01stats for Air Dog (Wins, Losses, etc) should come up!

15,01+--....       ....--+
15,01This section includes all the TESTED characters for the Super Nintendo 
15,01Entertainment System.  Unfortunetly, I was NOT able to test the codes on the
15,01Sega Genesis, so please report back to me to make sure the codes work:
15,01                           
15,01AIR Dog
15,01-------                           
15,01        Air Dog is a 12 yr. old boy who I assume was a friend or child of       
15,01                     
15,01an NBA Jam Staff member.  He has alot of speed, and good dunks.

15,01Bill Clinton                           
15,01------------                           
15,01        Bill Clinton is of course (if you've been living in a sewer for awhile)
15,01the President of the United States Of America.  He is more or less a well       
15,01

15,01Kabuki 
15,01------                           
15,01        Kabuki maybe called someone else on the Genesis (at least thats         
15,01                   
15,01what my friends say), I'm not sure, but on the Super Nintendo he is Kabuki.
15,01He was probably a staff member or friend of a staff member at Acclaim.          
15,01                 
15,01Kabuki is also a well rounded character, and has ok dunks and ok 3 pointers
15,01Code: QB_ 
15,01SNES Key Punch: L START X
