15,01Not me; Them

15,01Looking ascance through the double paned windows
15,01Seeing the world of freedom mere inches away
15,01Longing for the cool unheavy air of outside...
15,01Locked inside a padded, uncaring, impersonal white room
15,01Fastened by countless straps, buckles and articles of tight clothing
15,01Lying helpless, motionless, upward unable to move in a bed
15,01Iching so intense; the skin screams for the pleasure of just one scratch
15,01This environment of pure HELL meant to aid- 
15,01Only rocks an already unstable mind
15,01Diconnectedly observing one's own mind battle itself; the boat of sanity going u
15,01nder
15,01Not because I AM crazy, but because this place would 
15,01Turn the most stable surefooted man lunitically mad- Out of  his *#$@ing mind;
15,01Crazy beyond reform
15,01        I DID see the monsters, the things in the ship
15,01        They DID probe and examine me- "Bzzzt" is what they were saying to each 
15,01other
15,01        Just a couple of grey beings (bzzzt) to start with
15,01        Looking at me with sure interest as if their next messiah is I
15,01        Then (bzzt, bzzt, bzzt) raised me in a showroom for hundreds of them to
15,01        (bzzt, bzzt) watch as if a new monkey at a zoo were on display.  All of 
15,01them
15,01        Saying (bzzzt, bzzzt- "Look mommy, he's acting funny"-)
15,01        (BZZZT)- "Nooo! Let me out!!"- Bada, bada, bada
15,01        "Mommy, help me!"
15,01        "Bzzt, bzzt, bzzt," they said.
15,01        "A la casa del loca para usted, bobo! Ha, ha, ha!"
15,01        "NOOOOOOO!"
15,01        "BZZZZZZZZZZT"
