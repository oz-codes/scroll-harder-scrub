15,01Hermit's Hole

15,01what is life if not pain
15,01falling like the gentle rain
15,01all to common in seclusion
15,01filling my mind with many an illusion
15,01a tapestry of life depicting despair
15,01with all too many holes and a tear

15,01what is pain if not life
15,01as common as earth's civil strife
15,01drifting through our souls
15,01burning down all our goals
15,01hidden in the fabric called destiny
15,01dreaming for the sane insanity

15,01who owns time if it's not mine
15,01chronos perhaps ripped on wine
15,01treading on our gravestones
15,01tearing the flesh off our bones
15,01pausing tieing replaying teasing
15,01for time's where he's playing

15,01what is mine if not time
15,01i dont even own a simple dime
15,01poor on the brink of the drink
15,01thinking of what is the missing link
15,01but really getting nowhere
15,01falling silently contently through the air

15,01ask the hermit or the old wise man
15,01you will find the answer in the plan
15,01mend the tears and all the holes
15,01pour water on the searing coals
15,01pick all the fallen flowers
15,01hidden the frightened child cowers
