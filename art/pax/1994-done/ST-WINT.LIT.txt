15,01The Winds of Winter Are Upon Us

15,01The winds of winter are upon us.
15,01The beautiful flowers begin to die.
15,01I cry to my true love and make a fuss,
15,01If I did not care, it would be a lie.

15,01What will become of the sweet red roses?
15,01Shall I dig them up, or let them be?
15,01Will I remember them in nature's poses?
15,01Or will they become history?

15,01Soon the roses will lose their petals,
15,01And the sky will light up with snowflakes.
15,01The ground will harden with precious metals,
15,01There will be no more garden rakes.

15,01Flowers must die, for it's natures way.
15,01You will will wither and die, when I kill you today.
