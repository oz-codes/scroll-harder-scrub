00,01A man was walking down a beach one day
00,01and saw another man throwing starfish back into the water.
00,01And the man saw him and said,
00,01"Why are you throwing the starfish back into the sea?"
00,01And the other man replied, "If they aren't in the sea, they will die."
00,01And the man looked around and saw thousands and thousands of starfish
00,01 all around the beach.
00,01So he said, "But there are thousands! What does it matter?"
00,01And the other man picked up a starfish and held it in his hand and looked at it.

00,01Then he looked at the man and said, "Well, it matters to this one."
00,01And he threw it into the sea.

00,01This is the story of me and you.
