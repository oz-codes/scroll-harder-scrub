15,01New Stuff in Beta #4 -

15,01- File sorting fixed.  Fucked it up in #3...

15,01- Viewing ANSIs in VGA is implemented.  It's a little lame, and works better
15,01  with some ANSi files than with others, but send me some feedback telling me
15,01  what ya think!

15,01- Some bugs in VGA GIF-view functions cleaned up.

15,01New stuff in Beta #3 -

15,01- Mouse file selection fixed -- I think!

15,01- GIF View function requires VESA card or Emulator.  UNIVESA.EXE included...
15,01  Should work better now, if you have the memory for it.

15,01- More informative error messages in GIF view.  Blank screens suck.

15,01- SAUCE support.  SAUCE will override GVIEW.DAT information.

15,01- Mouse scrolling is now FAST(er)

15,01- Drive selection available in change directory mode.  Wow!

15,01What mainly needs testing:

15,01- I want GIF viewing tested on as many computers as possible to ensure
15,01  compatibility...

15,01- There *may* be crash problems with VScreen mode, lemme know if it locks up
15,01  on ya..  I doubt it.

15,01What DOESN'T work:

15,01- Viewing ANSi in VGA.  The code is there, just not implemented.  Can't make
15,01  it look right.  ### Now implemented in v4 ###

15,01- RIP - Want it supported, find me info on it!

15,01- GIFLited GIFs.  They'll work if you remove the GIFLITE header.  I have no
15,01  info on the GIFLITE header, so I don't know how to filter it out.. :(

15,01                              -=- That's All! -=-
