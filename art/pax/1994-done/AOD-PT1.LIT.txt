13,01  04Piercing through my 13mind, I wonder why the w04orld is crumbling away.
04,01As the people around 13have begun to go against e04ach other, people are
04,01even more scared th13an ever. Life would probably b04e even better if this
04,01wasn't so...but w13hy is it? Looking around miserably.04..thinking....thinking
04,01of something th13at may happen now, or in the future....04What is to come?
04,01Conquered? D13estroyed?....Death? Looking around, you also 04find out that people
04,01are not l13ike how they should be. Friends are enemies, and 04enemies want to be
04,01friends.  13Closer...and closer...you realize that people aro04und you are not
04,01as good a13s how they want you to see them. As they are sacred 04towards people,
04,01they sha13ll never be found out truthfully.
