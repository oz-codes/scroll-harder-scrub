15,01Well if you are an ansi artist and are interested in joining CAE please call up
15,01The Land of Rape and Honey a.k.a. TLORAH-713.686.0054 and login under CAE,
15,01password:tlorah. You don't have to be some Acid quality artist to get in but
15,01that would be nice..:> mainly we are looking for artists with potential.  If you
15,01suck hard but are improving fast then upload you newer ansi's and we'll take a
15,01look.  We are in need of new artists! :> and we shall never have enough... We
15,01are also looking for long distance couriers and distro's in area codes that we
15,01don't already have one.  We don't really need anymore musicians at the moment,
15,01but if you are as good as or better than the musicians we have then go ahead and
15,01apply.  You may have noticed that we don't have any VGA artist's at the moment
15,01but that is soon to change so if you do VGA and you think you can get in please
15,01apply.  We could use another coder or two also, so if you can code and are
15,01interested please apply on TLORAH... We have an application generator in the
15,01works but unfortunatly we didn't get it done in time for the pack so it isn't in
15,01there. It should be finished very soon now so look for it in your area code. If
15,01you don't have a CAE distro site in your area code then look around... If you
15,01got the pack chances are there will be an application generator floating around
15,01somewhere so ask around.  Of course if you really want it just call up a distro,
15,01member board, or TLORAH.  CAE is growing quickly and so is our artits quality
15,01with each new ansi/mod they do so look around for our pack at the first of every
15,01month.  Thanks and enjoy the pack!
