15,01                    06Twisted    Love

15,01                                             06By Voodoo Child
15,01                   06For three long years
15,01                   06my heart only lusted
15,01                  06To hold you in my arms

15,01                06And now that I finally do
15,01             06I find it hard to say I love you
15,01               06because your corpse is cold

15,01           06It seems though I was always fun
15,01             06I could never play the game
15,01             06With every single love I had
15,01           06The result always seemed the same

15,01             06You reject me again and again
15,01              06just as everyone did before
15,01         06But for you my heart would not let go
15,01        06and for that you will breathe never more

06,01    You never cared about me, but I always cared for you
15,01           06And I saw that in some dream-world
15,01               06that you would love me too
15,01          06you laughed me off like everyone else
15,01                 06the freak of nature who
15,01            06was such a wierdo, such a loser
15,01               06destined for a human zoo

15,01          06You're cold my love, you breathe no more
15,01                06And I shall join you soon
15,01             06for no one seems to see my side
15,01       06I sit with you in one hand, a knife in my other
15,01           06and next to you, falls my cold hide.
