14,01    15This month we show off the amazing talents of Red Leader and The Masked
15,01  Pirate. It's funny, I remember when Red Leader gave me that storm ansi
15,01  almost a year ago for an early Eternity pack, I thought it was amazing!
15,01  Well, I sure am glad he didn't give me those for this months Nation
15,01  Extravaganza. :) How about those TMP ansis! WOW!! Those were awesome guy!
15,01  Now those ansis Spirit Of Illusion released in this months Yuck pack were
15,01  the ansis he applied to Eternity with. I thought they were awesome!!
15,01  Now folks, look at the pics these guys have in this months pack and compare
15,01  them to their Yuck stuff.. Hmm.. I'd say they've made quite and improvement
