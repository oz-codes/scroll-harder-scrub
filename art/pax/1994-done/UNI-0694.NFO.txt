15,01       Alright, it's a bit late, but then again, it's what's inside that
15,01    counts.  Back again is the every prominent Union Productions with yet
15,01    another exquisite collection of fine arts.  The members of Union have
15,01    been working outrageously hard to put together the June compendium.
15,01    It is amazing to me, how far Union has been brought since the early
15,01    days of the two base groups, Void and Image.  I must take a moment to
15,01    congratulate the founding Senior members as well as the new additions
15,01    to the organizing ranks.

15,01       Union must begin by appologizing for the inconveniences created over
15,01    the last month of production.  The Senior members and other organizing
15,01    staff were at somewhat of a loss for being able to contact other members
15,01    and sites.  However, we *will* contact all those that we have yet to
15,01    reach as soon as we can.  It is this example of unreliablility that Union
15,01    strives to iron out of its group.  Again, to all those we have inconveni-
15,01    enced, please accept our apologies.

15,01       Over the last month, the hard working Ansi department has been at
15,01    it again recruiting extremely talented artists from across the US and
15,01    Canada.  Union welcomes Sole Assassin who left iDP to join the ranks of
15,01    Union.  As well, Krypton becomes a member of Union, imported in from the
15,01    now extinct Department Nine.  Elsewhere, Eclipse from Cancer teams up
15,01    with Union as an excellent RIP artist.  Eclipse will be working in both
15,01    camps by releasing alternately with each group.  Perhaps in the future,
15,01    Union will get to see more of Eclipse as a full-time member.  Union's
15,01    musical crew grows one more this month.  Florescent Darkness, formerly
15,01    of Empire, steps up beside Future Assassin and Satanic Goldfish in the
15,01    looney world of music composers.  Yes, it seems as if Union is still on
15,01    the trail of unclaimed Empire artists.

15,01       There were a few additions and, unfortunately, deletions to the site
15,01    list.  Check out the site list as well as the new and improved UniNet
15,01    nodelist (Union's own dedicated art network).  Union has finally decided
15,01    to open up a department for those dedicated people out there that so
15,01    many groups rely on but give little thanks to.  Union announces the
15,01    opening of a courier division.  As most groups know, there comes a time
15,01    when the members themselves just can't seem to pull through every month
15,01    in getting their files to the supporting sites.  With this, Union would
15,01    like to extend an invitation to all reliable and experienced couriers
15,01    to join in the Union team.  Union is in particularly looking for Canadian
15,01    couriers to even up the ranks.  To all those that are intersted and feel
15,01    that they fit the bill, don hesitate to fill out the application enclosed
15,01    and upload it promptly to Flatlined Reality.

15,01       One word more word from our network coordinator, all sites that have
15,01    recently joined in to support Union, will have to have the UniNet setup
15,01    by June 20, 1994.  This net is, however, entirely optional for member
15,01    boards.  But, for those sites who are interested in joining Union, this
15,01    is one of the major requirements to being a site and through which to
15,01    show your support.

15,01       On a more cheery note, Union wished to congratulate Nailz and
15,01    Neurotic for finally hitting puberty as they both age another year in
15,01    the final twenty-four hours of compiling the pack.  Happy Birthday guys!
15,01    And one final note, although the new and improved UniView still has some
15,01    bugs to be ironed out, I'd like to heartily thank Apex and especially
15,01    Pennywise for his hard dedicated effort put into the viewer.  As well,
15,01    the "homey" in the Ansi interface may look familiar to you, it is Dark
15,01    Image's from his old Dead Homey's PCBoard Menu.  Sorry you didn't get
15,01    direct credits in the picture Dark Image, it seems to have been removed
15,01    from beside his leg, hence these credits.  It is in no way a character
15,01    created by Nailz and is entirely Dark Image's, formerly of Union.
15,01    However, the rest of the Ansi interface is a creation of Nailz.

15,01       I think that about sums up the works and business of Union over the
15,01    last month.  We hope you enjoy the pack, and if you like what you see,
15,01    and/or are interested in joining the group as a member or a supporting
15,01    site, do not hesititate to contact the group on a major Headquarter
15,01    board.  As a final word to all art groups out there, "Remember, we are
15,01    here to express through pictures the artistic endeavours of the extremely
15,01    skilled for which words can not rightly justify."
