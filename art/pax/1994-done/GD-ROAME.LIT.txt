15,01roamers.

15,01you raise your head
15,01to laugh aloud
15,01and drink from the dead
15,01swooning in the cloud

15,01stop them from falling
15,01stop them from dieing
15,01they've missed their calling
15,01tired of lying

15,01trapped by what they know
15,01to little to show
15,01anyone who cares doesn't know
15,01their brain is to slow

15,01but caught in a world
15,01trapped by a flood
15,01dead yet floating in mud
15,01into the phantasmal wood

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
