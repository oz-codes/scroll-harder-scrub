15,01--------------------

15,01The world is facing a dire crisis,
15,01We're running out of space
15,01There are too many people and too little land.
15,01The world is running out of food as
15,01All of the fertile lands are turning arid.
15,01There are droughts in Ethopia, Rwanda and the midwest
15,01And Mother Earth doesn't get any help from us
15,01With the world becoming so dirty
15,01From the waste of all its billions of citizens
15,01The world begins to resemble a garbage dump
15,01And one can only wonder, what the future holds.

15,01The planet earth is overcrowded
15,01                                  And Mankind has nowhere to go
15,01The world is much too crowded
15,01                                  And there is no easy cure.
