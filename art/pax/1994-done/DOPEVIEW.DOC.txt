15,01Introduction :

15,01         This is the first public release of this ansi viewer so I know its
15,01going to be pretty plain and all but everyone has to start somewhere right?
15,01This isn't going to be much of a documentation here because the program
15,01is self explanatory and its pretty late <Yawn>.  Basically this ansi viewer
15,01works just like any other, I recommend you put it in your Dos path so you can
15,01call it up in any directory, then you goto wherever your ansi's are located
15,01and run the program.

15,01Commands/How To Use:

15,01F = Changes the file mask.

15,01T = Toggles which screen resolution to use (More will be added later.)

15,01* = Sets the Viewer Speed at the fastest setting, this has no delay and will
15,01display the ansi/avatar file as fast as your computer will allow.

15,01/ = Sets the Viewer Speed at the lowest setting, this has much delay and will
15,01display the ansi/avatar file at a very slow rate.

15,01+ = Increments the Viewer Speed by 1.

15,01- = Decreases the Viewer Speed by 1.

15,01Enter = Displays current File.

15,01Space = Switches Directory views (not set up quite right yet).

15,01Escape = Quit the Program.

15,01NOTE: If you hit any key while a file is being displayed it will automaticly
15,01abort.

15,01Upgrades on Next Versions:

15,01- Rip Graphics Display.

15,01- Gif/PCX Display.

15,01- Support SAUCE (ACiD's Description system)

15,01- File Descriptions on list, & the ability to choose how you want the list
15,01  to be displayed.

15,01- Choices in how you want the viewer to look (Different interfaces).

15,01- Slide shows, where you tag which files you would like to view and it shows
15,01  them all one after another.

15,01- Scrollback, so you can look back at an ansi.

15,01- Baud rate simulations (No 0 - 99 speeds like I have now)

15,01- Change the command interface, either with some kind of menu (ie. Pulldowns,
15,01  or a help screen so i don't have to cram everything on the scren.)

15,01- I'm sure i can think of 100's of other things to add as I go along.
