15,01The Fall

15,01Up above the crystal dome
15,01Lies the fragile sky,
15,01Soothing us within,
15,01Blowing gentle breezes across
15,01  the wake,
15,01Into these shadow moments-

15,01So many times I have felt the edge,
15,01Silvery grey in its defiance.
15,01So many times I have been told
15,01To relive day by day,
15,01Till my heart is ripped from my
15,01  chest,
15,01And my soul is entrapped in a gold
15,01  box-

15,01Suffering the pangs of remorse,
15,01There is no time for the sky anymore,
15,01How long must we wait
15,01Until it comes crashing down?-

15,01Swallow up our evenings
15,01Sweet time,
15,01And give us the peace of mind to
15,01  settle the score,
15,01Life in death foreboding,
15,01Night coliding with day,
15,01The war to end all wars,
15,01Slaves to a greater purpose,
15,01Practicing the ways of keeping sane-

15,01Euphoria comes,
15,01Pain disappears,
15,01Life drowns in our world
15,01With the black smog of disappointment,
15,01Beware of heavenly skies when Saint Peter
15,01  calls,
15,01All that has been risen
15,01Must certainly fall-
