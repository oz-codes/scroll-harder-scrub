15,01She shouldn't have Died
15,01Author's note: this is about a girl my age who was murdered at 3:45 pm....

15,01She was in Grade Ten, like me
15,01She was sixteen; I'm sixteen-to-be
15,01She was a teen who should have been free.
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01She had a life ahead of her,
15,01Reminding us of what we once were
15,01A life that was taken by some smelly cur
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01I didn't know her, but we were the same
15,01Teenage females, bred to be tame
15,01Until along Mankind came
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01Men are powerful, they can be cruel
15,01Using women as a simple old tool
15,01If you think you're equal, you are a fool
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01I thought I was safe, living my life
15,01I'd grow up and be somebody's wife
15,01Didn't dream of weirdos armed with a knife
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01What is happening to us women now?
15,01When did it happen, why? and how?
15,01Why are we treated like so many cow?
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01Will I grow up? Turn sixteen?
15,01The world seems evil, evil and mean
15,01The terrors of teens are rarely seen
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01Reality comes crashing in,
15,01Thinking is no longer a sin
15,01Women must be strong if they are to win
15,01She shouldn't have died.

15,01Why isn't the world a better place?
15,01Where you're judged on your heart and not on your face
15,01Is there any hope for the human race?
15,01She shouldn't have died.
