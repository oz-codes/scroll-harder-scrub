15,01Looking at the night sky, I see all the stars...
15,01So beautiful, so peaceful
15,01Everything is calm
15,01Suddenly, as if it were never there...
15,01Gone.
15,01I look up into the sky now and all I see is black
15,01Nothing beautiful, nothing peaceful
15,01The world is complete chaos
15,01Nothing is calm as it once was...
15,01Thinking to myself, "What happened?"
15,01"Why has everything suddenly left me?"
15,01Wondering how on earth this could happen...
15,01Everything changed all at once...
15,01I can't take this!
15,01Glancing into the blackness of the sky...
15,01Trying to find one last star.
15,01Something to build everything up again
15,01I see a sparkle...
15,01The star...I've found one
15,01It's so distant, but it's there
15,01If only I could get close,
15,01Maybe things would return to the way I knew them
15,01It won't ever come to me, perhaps I must pursue it...
15,01I try and try, but it will not happen
15,01I must give up...I have to.
15,01I need to learn how to be happy...
15,01Happy with what I have,
15,01Perhaps some day, this beautiful star will come to me...
15,01Until then I will have to be happy...
15,01Admire it's beauty, it's splendor...
15,01And all...from a distance
