15,01        Left with only a business card in the computer memory holding the 
15,01possibility of owning a million euros, he began a search of the net.  "Damn,
15,01this guy is GOOD!" he thought, finding no trace of where the man had been 
15,01before they had met.  He had only had one account he couldn't trace before, 
15,01someone that called themselves Dr. Tronix.  His rival in everything, but he 
15,01didn't even know what hemisphere he was from.  They were two of the best;  
15,01Neither knew each other personally, but the thought of another decker they 
15,01couldn't trace was enough to make either of their blood boil.  

15,01        "Proceeding from login.  Please identify yourself," requested the 
15,01computer.  He jacked into his deck to try and find the access password.  He 
15,01tried all the methods he could think of to get into this part of the net;  He
15,01had been browsing carelessly and somehow stumbled on something he hadn't seen 
15,01before.  Of course, being a good, respectable hacker, he had to try to get in.
15,01He tried brute processor force, letting his chips come up with random number 
15,01and letter sequences.  Failing that, he tried to think of what someone running
15,01this kind of system would use;  It was obviously new, but whoever ran it 
15,01probably knew something about computers, or he'd have been in a long time ago. 
15,01What would an 'op new to running a system use?  He glanced over at the system 
15,01name, to see if it had any inspiration for him.  The sign said "DragonsBlood 
15,01Engineering".  He tried many different passwords;  Fire, Scorch, Camelot, and 
15,01everything else he could think of related to dragons.  Finally something 
15,01worked;  Pendragon.

15,01        He was in.  The gate, the net's symbol for a logon request, opened.  
15,01Looking cautiously for dangers, he stepped in.  What was this world he had 
15,01come across?  He felt something sharp come across his back, and he felt the 
15,01hair on his neck stand in the air.  Instince told him it was time to leave. 
15,01He knew something bad, something electronic, was around, and it could fry his 
15,01brain unless he pulled the plug, at the slight risk of brain damage from 
15,01jacking out too quick.  

15,01        "SHIT!"  The sharp, aching pain he'd come to know all to well came 
15,01across his brain as he pulled the plug.  It could take hours until he was 
15,01completely revived, but then he'd stock up on the latest counter-ICE programs 
15,01and go back.  He had found something new, and it was NOT getting away.
