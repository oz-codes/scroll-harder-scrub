02,01Alone
14,01No one is near
14,01Down from my eye
14,01Drips a small tear

02,01Sadness
14,01All has gone wrong
14,01Deeper I sink
14,01When singing her song

02,01Love
14,01Gone but once mine
14,01She left my soul empty
14,01Though it healed in time

02,01Recovery
14,01Life starts to improve
14,01Yet still the thought lingers
14,01She watches each move

02,01Resolution
14,01My life again flows
14,01For she's watching me always
14,01Guiding my growth

15,01Dedicated to my late Aunt/guardian.  May she rest in peace.
