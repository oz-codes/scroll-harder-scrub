15,01I started reading this group just after its newgroup message came
15,01through a few months back.  Within a short time afterwards, Ithat, in fact,
15,01discovered that my house had become part of the weekly circuit for
15,01the local lemur population. Ever wonder who reads the arbitron
15,01stats?  Now, every Thursday night is poker night.  A night where I
15,01get to supply the twinkies (used for betting) and all the Big K

15,01Anyway, I had just gotten back from the store where I loaded up
15,01for tonights game and was searching for some stuff in the back
15,01room, when I heard a noise coming from the kitchen.  When I went
15,01to check it out, I found a single lemur making a mess of mys?d.

15,01This lemur put them all to shame.  When I yelled at it to watch
15,01where it was throwing the coldcuts, it poked it head over the door

15,01The more I saw, the more I figured something was wrong.  The lemur away,
15,01staring at me had a cigar stuck in its mouth and the eyes looked a a
15,01little funny.  They were different sizes and two different colors
15,01to boot.  Whats more, as it moved I kept hearing a noises like
15,01gears grinding.  When I wouldn't tell it where the beer was, itow would

15,01to try to grab it.
15,01&#62;Late at night, there will be a low knocking at your door. Thinking

15,01and into the back end.  The funny thing was, that as it drove off
15,01and hit one of the speed bumps outside of my apartment, the panel
