15,01            12which causes you to stroke the nape of my neck
15,01            12like a lover drifting to sleep in the passenger seat
15,01            12during a long & featureless drive home,
15,01            12As I know the moon has yet to rise
15,01            12above the sleek pines of Tahoe,
15,01            12casting its bright path across the water's quite face.
15,01            12I consider telling you of the last time;
15,01            12her slow approach that evening,
15,01            12like a swan coming in for a brief touch
15,01            12only to rise again from the water like a ghost,
15,01            12mist opening out for her so that she was gone in a instant,
15,01            12water rippling in a graceful flow
15,01            12that became waves beating at the shore.
15,01            12I might say her lips didn't open the entire time,
15,01            12only her eyes, dark as umbrellas
15,01            12for the few moments before she disappeared out the door.
