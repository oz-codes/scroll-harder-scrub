15,01                                        Sword Weaverr [HAVOK]

15,01From the slumber I awoke - to find
15,01Blackness all around enveloping all.
15,01So dark I thought - God had strucken
15,01Dear Apollo down.

15,01There despondent I sat - awakened from my slumber.
15,01Waves of emotion flooded the thing I called my soul.
15,01It - was writhing in pain and sorrow 
15,01Seeking solace in the dark.

15,01Then, slowly, I raised my head and looked,
15,01For I felt a soothing precense approach
15,01Bringing hope into the darkness.
15,01Wind rustling nearby signaling the change.

15,01A glow appeared - seeming to me as bright 
15,01As the afternoon sun on a summer day.
15,01As I continued to stare in wonder 
15,01The point in space, exuding that light
15,01Began to dim.

15,01I opened my mouth in protest and shut it once more
15,01As the world of darkness I had come to known
15,01Shattered from my silent outcry in the dark.
15,01A slight drizzle at first - then a monsoon of light
15,01Pouring down from the heavens above

15,01At first I basked in its warmth and loving care
15,01But then as more and more light came
15,01It began burn like fire, blistering my soul.
15,01I cringed away and wished I had never spoken
15,01That fateful outcry of longing.

15,01I picked up the pieces of my shattered reality
15,01And tried to ressurect the darkness from the shards.
15,01I fervently prayed and prayed still in agony
15,01'Til the prayers were answered.

15,01The answer was simple,
15,01Peace had come and
15,01I slept once again.
