15,01my girl
15,01she was one too
15,01 she was everything
15,01she was paid for her looks
15,01wore her beliefs like a thick
15,01cloak, she kept me in the dark
15,01but really it was what I wanted
15,01when she told me
15,01when she told me of
15,01being chained to a bed
15,01and left for dead
15,01for 8 hours
15,01when she told me
15,01of having sex on the hood of a car at a party
15,01when we try and keep the ones we love happy
15,01we try and keep them blind
15,01we are afraid if they see the real us
15,01they won't want anything to do
15,01or they will bore with us
15,01and it isn't just our lovers and friends
15,01keeping up with the Joneses
15,01is about the exact same thing
15,01we don't want people to know we are different
15,01we don't want them to know
15,01that we think for ourselves
15,01that maybe we are poorer
15,01or maybe we are wealthier
15,01 it is crammed into our heads
15,01from the first moment
15,01mommy sits us down
15,01in front of the T.V.
15,01we are never taught of free thinking or
15,01reasoning
15,01we are taught numbers and dates
15,01and are asked to memorise them for the
15,01upcoming quiz
15,01I still don't know my times tables
15,01And despite all my teachers warning of the dire effects of not knowing my times
15,01tables, I am doing all right
15,01I can do it in my head
15,01it just isn't pablum stored in my head
15,01why must we learn things by rote
15,01boredom as I have said before
15,01is taught to us
15,01from an early age
15,01if we didn't get bored why would we need to accumulate all the unnecesary thing
15,01we have in our lives
15,01attention spans get shorter and shorter
15,01and purchasing things gets more and more convienient
15,01the birth of the mall is an example
15,01before people
15,01would go downtown to all the little shops to get things now
15,01they want it all within 5 minutes drive and all under one roof

15,01goodnight
