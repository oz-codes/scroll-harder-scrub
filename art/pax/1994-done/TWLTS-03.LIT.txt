15,01        The sun arose in the quiet realm of Tyrania; the crisp scent of the
15,01morning dew, and the sweet smell of the spring flowers. It was another
15,01perfect day, in the holy land. In the distance, the sounds of church bells,
15,01ringing was another sign that the new day was ready to begin. There was no
15,01noise then; no evil.
15,01        The people of Tyrania were a community of harmony. They all lived
15,01together, amongst themselves, sharing everything. No matter, what race; elf,
15,01halfling, gnome, or human. All were looked upon as brothers and sisters. The
15,01acts of racism, and prejudice were forgotten. For, their society had leaned 
15,01away from the chaos of their homelands. They decided to strive for cultural
15,01peace. They were the ones who tried to show the light to the others of their
15,01races, but they didn't listen. Greed, and pride meant too much to them. Now
15,01that the ones who stayed in the other lands have died off, in either war, or
15,01local violence. Evil had struck their lands; but that would never happen to 
15,01Tyrania.
15,01        Nature, along with peace, reigned highly in the land. Great forests,
15,01and bodies of water, were scattered frequently across the realm. There was
15,01a plentiful supply of water, food, and other necessary items.
15,01        Tyranians were all vegetarians; the reason being that they had a 
15,01respect for nature, that the other tribes of races did not. They had a bond
15,01to nature that allowed them to understand the harm that flesh-eating caused
15,01to the web of life. Hence, they ceased the depletion, and now thrived on 
15,01various roots, and plants.
15,01        The realm of Tyrania was a hidden valley of haven, it was surrounded
15,01by the Heavens' Mountains; a towering ring that rose straight up into the 
15,01clouds; hence it's name.
15,01        At this time, it seemed that their tranquility would last for 
15,01eternity. But their ways were all soon to be changed.
15,01        It all began when . . .

15,01                              *   *   *   *   *

15,01        The bright morning rays of the sun burst through the drapes, and
15,01reached Trepid's eyes. He yawned, and sat up into an upright position. He
15,01searched for a sign of his little brother, or his mother; but he had
15,01forgotten, they had gone to visit his grandmother, who lived on the other
15,01side of Tyrania.
15,01        Trepid wearily arose, dressed himself, and prepared himself for
15,01the new day that awaited.
15,01        When he exited his house, he was greeted by a stout little elf, to 
15,01whom he did not know.
15,01        " Hey, you there; boy. Would you be interested in earning a pretty 
15,01penny working at the farm for me today? " The elf asked.
15,01        " No sir, not today; today I must go to the Citadel of the Magi.
15,01Maybe some other time, though, sorry. " Trepid said.
15,01        " Ahh, another of the Red Robe, eh? Hey, how come you aren't 
15,01wearin' one of those robes? " He asked disdainfully.
15,01        " I am not, yet, a mage. I am an apprentice of Thogus. Why do you ask
15,01in such nasty tones? " Trepid asked.
15,01        " Not a nasty tone, spoke I, I was only astonished that such a young
15,01lad, such as yourself, would be involved in witchcraft. " He retorted.
15,01        " It is only witchcraft to those who do not understand. " Trepid 
15,01rebounded quickly.
15,01        " Maybe so, but I am not one to be mixed into that crowd. G'day. "
15,01        " Good day sir . "
15,01        Trepid walked down the main street, and looked into the window of 
15,01the book store; which was owned by his aunt and uncle. There, on a red velvet
15,01cushion, was the ancient book of the Magi, it was very old, and very 
15,01expensive, but the knowledge in it was priceless; he desperatly longed for
15,01the book. With it, he could impress Thogus, and could become a true magician.
15,01        Trepid's Uncle walked outside and noticed Trepid staring at the book.
15,01        " Welcome, young Trepid. Where are you off to, so early in the 
15,01morning? I haven't even opened the store. "
15,01        " Well I was off to the Temple, to study the Way. " Trepid answered.
15,01        " I see you have noticed your present... I mean... my new book. " He
15,01blushed.
15,01        Trepid stared at his uncle. " Wha.. you mean.." Trepid stumbled.
15,01        " Yes, it was supposed to be your birthday present, your aunt and
15,01I were going to surprise you tomorrow on the accual day. But... I guess, now
15,01you know. " He said with a smile. " Don't tell your aunt, or she'd kill me, "
15,01he whispered, " forget this ever happened. "
15,01        Trepid smiled and departed with his uncle. He re-commenced his stroll
15,01down the street. He walked until he was standing before a high church, with
15,01a steeple, where a man was playing a tune on the bells.
