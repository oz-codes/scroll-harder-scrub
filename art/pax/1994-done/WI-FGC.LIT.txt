15,01White Insanity [Mistigris] Present : Fiberglass Candy

15,01Choking on my insecurity
15,01Overbiting teeth cause pain
15,01My animal strength is just insane

15,01I chew down on my fiberglass candy
15,01I know what it will do to me
15,01I know how it can hurt me
15,01But does anyone really care...

15,01Coughing blood up from my stomach
15,01Covered halls and desks in school
15,01I puke upon my bed I throw up from time to time

15,01I chew down on my fiberglass candy
15,01I know what it will do to me
15,01I know how it can hurt me
15,01But I know no-one cares...

15,01She had contractions as a normal
15,01Person in labour should have
15,01But a child she did not have,
15,01it was one big blood clot

15,01I chew down on my fiberglass candy
15,01I know what it will do to me
15,01I know how it can hurt me
15,01My brain clots with aneurysms...

15,01Death faces me too well now
15,01She doesnt care, really
15,01She threw me in the gutter,
15,01got her use real well

15,01I broke my teeth on my fiberglass candy
15,01Not more till death now
15,01I know not of my life
15,01my life knows not of me
15,01I can't see people properly
15,01Pieces move and dissapear
15,01Picasso sights appear to be
15,01I can't make out my enemies
15,01I feel like a mime, stuttered speech if any

15,01She rang upon the door bell
15,01I know her much too well
15,01I knew she was hear to hurt me
15,01but I hurt me first

15,01My bleeding gums on fiberglass candy
15,01Life is fading out
15,01My mind is tripping
15,01Mind is fade...
15,01fade...
15,01discard...
