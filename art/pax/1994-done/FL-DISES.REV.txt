15,01[Disease]

15,01Dashing in a panic
15,01Mind racked in fear
15,01Rushing in no specific direction
15,01The end seems far from near

15,01Out of breath
15,01Take a seat on the curb
15,01Take a hit
15,01Feel your lungs burn

15,01A few moments later
15,01The rush hits your head
15,01Away from it all
15,01Floating like dead

15,01Hours of escape
15,01Temporary way out
15,01Then back to it all
15,01Time to scream and shout

15,01To this disease
15,01I cannot tend
15,01Addicted to fear
15,01The cycle never ends
