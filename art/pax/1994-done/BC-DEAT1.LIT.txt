15,01hello boys and girls.
15,01today I explore the realm of intensities.
15,01of course to further these explorations I usually consume psychotropic
15,01substances... usually.
15,01today I am trying a new drug.

15,01death.

15,01yes.
15,01that's right.

15,01death.
15,01the way it fucks you up.
15,01makes you reconsider everything.
15,01makes your whole life shift when you think of its effects.


15,01imagine the possibilites.
15,01I wrote a poem just a minute ago.
15,01it was on fragile paper.






15,01          THE death has just been cracked.
15,01               stagnant black yolk
15,01                 dribbles
15,01                     from the
15,01                 tattered shell.
15,01                      eggshell life
15,01               Burst out exploding, roaring, alive.
15,01                  alive brightest at then end.

15,01          and then
15,01           the
15,01                descent

15,01          descending drama puppet dance
15,01          strings pulling every which way
15,01          vulturing at the morsel of life
15,01          cackling with sonic booms.
