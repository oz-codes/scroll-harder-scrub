15,01Insane



15,01Some may call me crazy; even inhumane.
15,01Some may phrase me a lunatic, but I'm only just insane.

15,01Got a blow-torch to my head
15,01With the flame turned up on high.
15,01I've only got a few seconds left;
15,01It's just about time to die.

15,01Can you hear me screaming in the rain?
15,01Can you feel my body convulsing with pain?
15,01Can you see the blood that's gushing from my brain?
15,01Truth is, you're the master now -
15,01     I'm only just insane.
