15,01Perplexed by my troubles
15,01Engulfed by my thoughts
15,01I can't stand it no more
15,01It is all boiling up

15,01I don't know what to do
15,01Don't know how to handle it
15,01Need to shed some light
15,01And open up the hidden box

15,01Get everything straight
15,01And I will be fine
15,01A long road ahead
15,01On a bike with no wheels

15,01Stuck at the crossroad
15,01And don't know where to go
15,01Forget them or go with them
15,01I just don't know

15,01I can go one forever
15,01But for now I am stuck
15,01One wheel off
15,01Another coming soon
15,01I am stuck and don't know what to do...
