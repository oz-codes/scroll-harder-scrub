15,01        Welcome to Kithe, the official newsletter of Mistigris. At first 
15,01this was just going to be a text file, like an .NFO file, but we decided to
15,01spice it up a bit, and then people started adding articles, and letters,all by
15,01and it kinda looks alot like an Emag now. This is just the first version of
15,01Kithe, and the scrolling can be kinda slow in some of the bigger articles,
15,01but remember there's a page down/up key if it gets too slow. This will be
15,01fixed in the next version, which is already being worked on.

15,01the four issue's of it in Kithe on Cthulu's request. Well, thats all for
