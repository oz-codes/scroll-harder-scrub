15,01-|- What is ViBE?

15,01    [ViBE] Vision Impaired Beyond Explanation is an ANSi Group that
15,01consists ANSi/VGA/GIF Artists. Give us time for the group to expand.
15,01ViBE is different from all other ANSi Groups [I hope] because we can
15,01only draw Title Screens including: InfoForms/Door Games/BBS Ads/Menus
15,01& more! We will not draw any kind of pictures. It's hard to see some
15,01sample of our work because until people requests something done, 
15,01then ANSi packets will be released monthly. For now, get VIBEINFO.ZIP
15,01which is all the Information you need to become a Distribution Site
15,01or have an ANSi made just for your BBS or Door Game. If you want to
15,01take a look at some ANSis/VGA we made, get VIBE594.ZIP. That's the
15,01official May 1994 Art Packet. If everything works out, GREAT! Then 
15,01we can get bigger and serve you better. If you havn't noticed, 
15,01Christopher Jong is the President [Maker of WildCat! ANSi Screens]. 
15,01IF YOU NEED AN ANSI DONE FOR YOU, PLEASE ASK ViBE TO DO THE JOB!

15,01ANSis are NOT free, you of course have to pay a small fee.
