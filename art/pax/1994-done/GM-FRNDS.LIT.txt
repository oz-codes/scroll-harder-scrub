15,01Of Freinds,
15,01many I have no need.
15,01Those with some,
15,01this caution I heed.
15,01My feelings have died,
15,01my hatried has grown.
15,01Many I've ment,
15,01Taught,
15,01and the've flown.
15,01Most have been mean,
15,01some have broken my bones,
15,01my freinds have left me,
15,01and taken my home.
15,01Destroyed my life,
15,01and ruined my hope,
15,01they all did me favors,
15,01that were really just loans.
15,01For this I tell all the hurt never ends,
15,01Advice I'm not giving,
15,01just looking for true freinds.
15,01Some are okay,
15,01my feelings they read.
15,01they've always been there in times of great need.
15,01Others I know,
15,01only lookout for themselves,
15,01well to them I just say,
15,01"you can all go to hell".
15,01My freinds understand and share all my joy,
15,01My love,
15,01My sorrow,
15,01Whether girl or boy.
15,01These are the freinds a person really needs.
15,01Not the one's who's thoughts are all 'ME'.
15,01Those with freinds like mine,
15,01I'm happy for you.
15,01But those with out need not be blue,
15,01just keep on the lookout,
15,01they'll probably find you...
15,01                                'End'
