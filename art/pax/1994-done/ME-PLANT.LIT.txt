15,01A little plant turns to sun
15,01Feeling proud of who he is and whats to come
15,01Plant smiles at me and I laugh back
15,01Petals cause my heart attack
15,01But my grin remains, stuck to my face
15,01Plants love to murder, sepal, lace
15,01Stems hold more than I could see
15,01Germs and worms and lots of fleas
15,01But thats all part of being infested
15,01Like my sinus', head's congested

15,01I'm in a field, vegetative state is sealed
15,01I can't wonder cause my life's peeled..

15,01Another little tree wonders whats in his mind
15,01And where'd my eyes go and why am I blind
15,01Lost in the soil, dive in the dirt
15,01Winter leaves trees cold, pollen can't flirt
15,01Death, destruction, pain and killing
15,01Sun, seedlings, happiness and feeling
15,01You, can't tell me where to grow
15,01Don't tell my branches where to go 
15,01Trees can't think and I can't feel 
15,01But we both eat sunlight for a last meal

15,01I'm in a field, vegetative state is sealed
15,01I can't wonder because I'm being peeled....

15,01Confusion of the grass and the insects
15,01Lonely blade, lonely bee, the rejects
15,01Am we like them, blind but with a thousand eyes
15,01Green and jealous with a thousand lies
15,01Eaten by bovine and crawled in by millipedes
15,01Lost, like a detective, no clues, no leads
15,01Love me and help to grow long and yellow, gold
15,01So I can match the color of my stomach, true n' old
15,01I'm in a field, my vegetative state is sealed
15,01Why the hell am I wondering unless I will be peeled?
