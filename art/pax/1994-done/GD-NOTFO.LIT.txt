00,01Nothing's Forever

00,01What is wrong great sun
00,01Your withering great sun
00,01Won't you shine my sun

00,01Heavens infinite or so they say
00,01But what if hell was to freeze today
00,01Where would our evil souls stay

00,01The cult of spring showed by a tree
00,01Blossoms in the summer only to be
00,01a part of winters fall of misery

00,01I'll see you in the spring of being
00,01Rejoicing in the splendor of dreaming
00,01Slowly waiting for our killing

00,01The fire has extinguished itself
00,01The universe consumes herself
00,01with us and everything else
