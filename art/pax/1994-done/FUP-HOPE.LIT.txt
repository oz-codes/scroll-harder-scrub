15,01At Least I Hope


15,01      Walk screaming down cold corridors of clean steal, steel my heart, always
15,01dark it seems another reason to wear glasses besides the obvious fashion. Of it
15,01all, seems to fade like wood in the sun, want to tell you but can't always
15,01run.....away from you from the truth from how I feel...feel? Alone lonely if
15,01only. Stop street traffic lights stop me stop green stop telling you lies. lay
15,01down my head and cry.... poor boy, changes his clothes and puts on aftershave
15,01to compensate for his ordinary shoes.. drift in and out of cheap people bars
15,01filled with the stench of age and stale liqueur another round for my fiend here
15,01her call out when I get up and leave......I tell her I can't cause I don't love
15,01her she says that doesn't matter so I do and it does and it is bad and boring
15,01like every other time, get bored not cause its women not at all, men are just
15,01as boring but less attractive and less real more hid deep feelings never to be
15,01revealed like me with you. Why can i not seem to tell you how I feel..never had
15,01this problem before, the word love used to just spew out of my mouth now that
15,01I actually might be feeling it I can't even tell you I like you a lot never
15,01felt this before probably never will again and I keep dreaming although we will
15,01probably never be more than friends and to think Mrs. Harris thought that we 
15,01were going out and didn't that just make my heart flutter and then before when
15,01describing Mr. M and the dream state which he seemed to conjure and all the
15,01special feelings that go with seeing someone creative, but he screwed you
15,01around and now you wont trust me at least it seems to me or well you do but you
15,01say I don't count. Cause I'm not like the rest and that's why you like me but
15,01not in that way, that way you still want the rest and I don't understand. LSD
15,01and beer on a cool night after one long screech my ears ringing you glowing me
15,01not knowing, what to say how to act and where oh where the fuck do I stand with
15,01you? I ask this question to myself but do nothing to find the answer in real
15,01life. REEL life, splicing and mixing tape into the wee hours alone and can
15,01anyone understand the pure joy I get from the "fucking noise" that everyone
15,01else seems to hate, but I've found others over the years. Where do I stand with
15,01YOU? do you hate me? for not telling her ?do you find me pathetique? or just
15,01boring? and ringing in your ear? Oh but you love it .....at least I hope.
