15,01Ok, I donno if this is for sure or not, but The Keg, Imperial US HQ, went
15,01down. I am not sure if Six Pack is gone for good, and I've only know this
15,01for a couple of days, but I must think the worse. If he is down for good,
15,01there  will be a spot in Imperial for another USHQ.  I would want someone
15,01that does alot of LD,  and does not run a board too popular, I don't want
15,01anyone applying for it  just for the  title,  I want them to be dedicated 
15,01and will TOTALLY focuse their attention on Imperial.

15,01Don't be alarmed, this will not actually cause holes in the group, it may
15,01just make it harder to stay in touch with a few guys,  but we do want to
15,01fill the gap, although I do hope Six Pack comes back.

15,01To apply, call Holocaust! at 1-604-271-5432 and apply for an account with
15,01the NUP: LITHIUM. I will not look at apps or mail from the GUEST account.
15,01And please, only apply if you are of course,  from the US, and if you are
15,01willing to dedicate yourself to Imperial.

15,01The race is on.
