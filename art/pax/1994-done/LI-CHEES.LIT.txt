15,01   "Stop that, " said the cheese, as my knife peeled off a
15,01paper-thin slice of its succulent flesh.  I ignored it, and
15,01continued devouring its still-moving corpse.  "I'm serious, " it
15,01warned.  I raised one eyebrow.  'What could a cheese possibly do
15,01to me?' I thought, and continued to eat.  "This is your last
15,01warning, " it said, slightly louder than before.  Not wishing to
15,01take any chances, I drew back, and with deadly precision, plunged
15,01the steel blade deep into the cheese, through its writhing body,
15,01and into the table.  "Now you've made me angry, " said the
15,01cheese.  I laughed heartily.  "You're only a cheese!" I
15,01challenged.  "What can you possibly do to me?"
15,01   "Oh, I've already got my revenge, " said the cheese smugly.
15,01   Now slightly worried, I fixed my gaze on the cheese, and
15,01demanded, "How!?"
15,01   "I'm not really a cheese, " it said, and with sudden terror, I
15,01began screaming, having come to the startling realisation that it
15,01was not a cheese after all, but my own leg.
