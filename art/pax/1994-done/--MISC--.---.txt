15,01          

15,01          Jock visited London for his annual holiday and stayed at a large
15,01          hotel.  However,  he  didn't  find  that  the natives  were very
15,01          friendly.
15,01             "At three o'clock every  morning,"  he  told  a friend, "They
15,01          hammered on my bedroom door, on the walls, even on the floor and
15,01          ceiling.  Sometimes they hammered so loud I couldn't hear myself
15,01          play the bagpipes."

15,01          There are many theories about the bagpipes,  otherwise  known as
15,01          the missing link between music and noise. 
15,01             Some say they were invented by a Scotsman who trod on his cat
15,01          and liked the noise.
15,01              Others  claim that  they are  based on the  noise of a dying
15,01          octopus.
15,01              However,  the truth is that they were given to  the Scots by
15,01          the Irish as a joke, and the Scots haven't seen the joke yet.

15,01          Tam MacJock was in  London  wearing his tartans  when  a curious
15,01          lady asked him if anything was worn under his kilt.
15,01              "No  madam,"  he replied with a  flourish, "Everything is in
15,01          working order."

15,01          A suitor  was looking for Jock's  daughter's  hand  in marriage.
15,01          Jock asked him, "Would you still marry my daughter if she had no
15,01          money?"
15,01             "Yes I would sir!" the young lad replied eagerly.
15,01              "Then  away  with  you.  We have enough  fools in the family
15,01          already."

15,01          A Scotsman wrote the following letter to a newspaper:
15,01          
15,01          Dear Sir,
15,01             
15,01              If you don't stop printing jokes about my fellow countrymen,
15,01          I shall have to stop borrowing your paper.

15,01          Jock's wife arrived home with the day's  provisions: six bottles
15,01          of whisky and a half loaf of bread.
15,01              Jock shouted  angrily at her,  "Why the hell  did you buy so
15,01          much bread?"

15,01          MacPherson went into a barber shop and asked how much it was for
15,01          a haircut.
15,01             "One pound."
15,01             "And a shave?"
15,01             "Fifty pence."
15,01             "Shave me heid, then."
