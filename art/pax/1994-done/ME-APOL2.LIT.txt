15,01                               The Apocalypse

15,01Can you imagine... 
15,01The chaos Wormwood shook,
15,01As it hit the ground so tremendeously?
15,01Or the cries of the archangels...
15,01In descent,
15,01Falling through the abyss?-

15,01This earth was promised a looking glass,
15,01And how it may seem to be beautiful,
15,01Underneathe lurks.
15,01Lift the top off of every can,
15,01Expose all the culpits,
15,01Kill at will... 
15,01Will the demand!
15,01Run like hell...
15,01Running dead...
15,01From the look into his firey eyes-

15,01Nothing is new...
15,01Nothing is old...
15,01From the mansions of his mind,
15,01To the depths of his soul,
15,01And so on, and so on we believe...
15,01Yet all hard evidence comes in proof
15,01Proof enough to describe-

15,01We were promised a new world,
15,01Where is that world now...?
15,01Maybe a shining star into the pass...
15,01Where things were gentler,
15,01And life... maybe a bit kinder,
15,01Or... a distant mystery...
15,01Where it's ours to define.
15,01Yet there is no time,
15,01In history or beyond...
15,01That can deny the existance of belief in God,
15,01Or the destruction of a kind world,
15,01And a judgement on mankind....
