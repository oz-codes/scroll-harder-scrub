00,01   15Well, welcome back to the second edition of vi!!
15,01First of all, i'd like to start out by a little overview of
15,01vi: who are we, what do we want, where are we from-- all the
15,01basic stuff which i neglected to include in the first pack.


12,01vi?

15,01visual insanity, vi, for short is a new (two month old)
15,01art group based in the chicagland area.  vi arose from the
15,01ashes of TaR, an even more localized 815 group, and the
15,01forthcomings of a 708 group headed by Hurricane.  As i don't
15,01want to get into long and boring detail, the group evolved
15,01very quickly in a very short amount of time.  Just seemed as
15,01if it HAD to happen.

15,01not much happening in the ansi department this month, we
15,01added one new member, God Speed.  GS is fairly new to the
15,01art scene, but making a good start, check out his debut
15,01harvest moon ansi.  As for other members: also , good job
15,01keep up the work..

15,01congradulations to Prometheus and God Speed, this months ONLY
15,01two artist that gave me finished ansi's, no.."oop's, i forgot
15,01the stats" or any crap like that.

15,01in vga we've recruited our first two VGA artists, Lithium and
15,01Beezlbub.  Lithium was previously invloved in the Quantum VR
15,01project, and Beezlbub, although not new to drawing VGA's is
15,01seemingly confused about the group 'scene', look for his stuff
15,01in the next pack

15,01music!!!, wow, ya gotta check out Necromancers MTM's...best i've
15,01heard in a long time!!!

15,01Ascii/Prompts:  hmm, new subs...well, i talked to western hq's
15,01sysop ryunoshuke one day, and he asked me if i wanted an ascii
15,01artist..and i really had nothing to say, 'duh!?'..
15,01Ryn will make his premier next month due to a system crach late
15,01this past month.  As for prompts, i was given some prompts by
15,01#25, and didn't know what to do with them, hell, why not make
15,01another sub.. No new artists will be accepted simply for making
15,01prompts.  only current artists.

15,01in the lit department this month, not much happening, necromancer
15,01was apperently working more on music, and usul was doing other
15,01miscellaneous coordinating duties.

15,01thas it
15,01enjoy the pack
