15,01# what is it for
15,01# october 5th 1994

15,01when i go to bed at night to sleep to dream
15,01to live the life i wanna live without the screams
15,01my life is nothing but an empty shell
15,01washed up upon the shores of shattered dreams i tell
15,01slowly going crazy going down going mad
15,01insane getting angry at the things that are bad
15,01slowly gathering strength at the foot of the bed
15,01are all the nasty little things inside my head
15,01blood dripping down the walls of my mind
15,01slowly staining all the memories it can find
15,01time melts away cotton candy in the rain
15,01slowly soaks my head slowly clears my brain

15,01i can't take it i don't need it i don't want it anymore
15,01i don't want and i don't know what it's for
15,01i can't take it i don't need it i don't want it anymore
15,01i don't want and i don't know what it's for

15,01so in the morning i lie awake in my bed
15,01and what's left of my life swirls round in my head
15,01i reach for the knife as i hear him say
15,01i'm sorry i didn't mean your life to be this way
15,01well sorry pal this is how it's gotta be
15,01you see i can't live with an enemy
15,01knife slices down and cuts through the skin
15,01in my life there's no word for sin
15,01take the lifeless body and push it out the door
15,01it's plain to see he won't need it anymore
15,01i've given him everything i wanna be
15,01opened his mind set his soul flying free

15,01i can't take it i don't need it i don't want it anymore
15,01i don't want and i don't know what it's for
15,01i can't take it i don't need it i don't want it anymore
15,01i don't want and i don't know what it's for
