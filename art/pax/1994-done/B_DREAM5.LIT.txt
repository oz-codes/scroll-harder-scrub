15,01now i see
15,01what you are writing
15,01it's like it's graffiti on a long wooden wall
15,01and the paint is drying and chipping..
15,01and it keeps falling to the floor, and getting stepped on
15,01by so many people
15,01who don't realize
15,01that the paint
15,01was part
15,01of a painting

15,01i had a dream last night
15,01i was wandering around on the old grounds of a school i once went to
15,01and an old friend whom i was in love with was living
15,01in one of the portables that i had classes in
15,01but she didn't know i was in love with her
15,01i never told her
15,01i never got that chance
15,01i went into the portable
15,01and she was there, exactly as i remember her
15,01and i laid down beside her
15,01and held her

15,01now i hear
15,01what you are saying
15,01it's like it's recorded on a record
15,01and it keeps skipping
15,01and repeating the words
15,01over and
15,01over and
15,01over 
15,01again
15,01and it keeps getting scratched and bumped
15,01by so many people
15,01who don't realize
15,01that the words
15,01were part
15,01of a song

15,01then when i woke up, i had the urge to call her
15,01but i did not pick up the phone
15,01because, i knew she had changed
15,01and i knew that i had changed
15,01maybe one day we will meet again..
15,01upon the plains of imagination.
15,01maybe there i will be able to tell her
15,01how i felt

15,01now you feel
15,01what i felt
15,01and it's like a black hole
15,01and the planet i am living on is slowly slipping into it
15,01and everyone keeps leaving on space ships
15,01but they do not
15,01invite me
15,01aboard
15,01so many people
15,01who don't realize
15,01that it is just
15,01a dream


15,01                                                drongo.
