15,01                       How to kill an eel

15,01Little Johnny was 12 years old and, like other boys his age,
15,01rather curious. He had been hearing quite a bit about 'courting'
15,01from the older boys, and he wondered what it was, and how it was
15,01done. One day, he took his questions to his mother who became
15,01rather flustered. Instead of explaining things to Johnny, she
15,01told him to hide behind the curtains one night and watch his
15,01older sister and her boyfriend. This he did. The following
15,01morning, Johnny described everything to his mother.

15,01"Sis and her boyfriend sat and talked for a while, then he turned
15,01off most of the lights. Then he started kissing and hugging her.
15,01I figured Sis must be getting sick because her face started to
15,01look funny. He must have thought so too because he put his hand
15,01inside her blouse to feel her heart, just like the doctor would,
15,01except he's not as smart as the doctor because he seemed to have
15,01trouble finding her heart.

15,01" I guess he was getting sick too because pretty soon both of
15,01them started panting and getting all out of breath. His other
15,01hand must have been cold because he put it under her skirt. About
15,01this time, Sis got worse and began to moan and sigh and squirm
15,01around and slide down toward the end of the couch. This was when
15,01the fever started. I knew it was a fever because Sis told him she
15,01felt really hot.

15,01" Finally, I found out what was making them so sick. A big eel
15,01had gotten inside him somehow. It just jumped out of his pants
15,01and stood there, about 10 inches long. Honest! Anyway, he grabbed
15,01it in one hand to keep it from getting away.

15,01" When Sis saw it, she got really scared. Her eyes got big and
15,01her mouth fell open. She started calling out to God and stuff
15,01like that. She said it was the biggest one she's ever saw. I
15,01should tell her about the one's down at the lake.

15,01" Anyway, Sis got brave and tried to kill the eel by biting it's
15,01head off. All of a sudden, she made a noise and let the eel go. I
15,01guess it bit her back.

15,01" The she grabbed it in both hands and held it tight while he
15,01took a muzzle out of his pocket and slipped it over the eel's
15,01head to keep it from biting again.

15,01" Sis laid back and spread her legs so that she could put a
15,01scissor lock on it and he helped be lying on top of the eel.

15,01" The eel put up a hell of a fight. Sis started groaning and
15,01squealing and her boyfriend almost upset the couch. I guess they
15,01wanted to kill the eel by squashing it between them.

15,01" After a while, they both quit moving and gave a great sigh. Her
15,01boyfriend got up. and sure enough, the had killed the eel. I knew
15,01it was dead because it just sort of hung there, limp, and some of
15,01its insides were hanging out.

15,01" Sis and her boyfriend were a little tired from the battle, but
15,01they went back to courting anyway. He started hugging her and
15,01kissing her again. By golly, the eel wasn't dead. It jumped
15,01straight up and started to fight again. I guess eels are like
15,01cats -- they have nine lives or something.

15,01" This time, Sis jumped up and tried to kill the eel by sitting
15,01on it. After a 35 minute struggle, they finally killed the eel. I
15,01knew it was dead because Sis' boyfriend peeled its skin off and
15,01flushed it down the toilet.

15,01" And that's the truth!"
