14,01W15e00ll folks, Heres the BL/+DE April 1994 Pak... We were pleased with the
14,01r15e00sponse to our first pak, and this one far exceed's it in quality.....

14,01F15i00rst and foremost in this months news... The BLADE President has changed his

14,01H15e 00is now MindCrime.

14,01S15e00condly, We would like to welcome Grafx to BL/+DE. He is our newest artist,
14,01j15o00ined up late on April 1st, so we were just able to sneak a few things in
14,01t15h00is pak. I'm sure he'll be a great addition.

14,01W15e 00have picked up 5 more Distro sites this month, and added another courier
14,01t15o 00the roster as well... This should help spread this pak a bit more...

14,01O15u00r programming still lacks, And we STILL don't have an ANSi Viewer, Thanks
14,01t15o 00Shadow Master, who promised me that it would be done on time... Thanks
