    | ][ |     THE LEGEND OF THE NUTWRENCH GOES BACK TO THE     
    | ][ |     GREAT DEPRESSION. IT WAS A SIMPLER TIME, WHERE   
    | ][ |     NUTS WERE FLUNG AROUND WITH WILD ABANDON AND     
    | ][ |     IF YOU DIDN'T SUCK COCK YOU WERE RUN OUT OF TOWN 
    | ][ |     ON A RAIL. THE NUTWRENCH WAS PROBABLY INVENTED BY
    | ][ |     MARCONI WHO AS WE ALL KNOW DID NOT INVENT THE    
    | ][ |     TELEPHONE BUT RATHER THE NUTWRENCH.              
    | ][ |                                                      
    | ][ |     THIS IS WHY NOBODY LIKES THE ITALIANS.
