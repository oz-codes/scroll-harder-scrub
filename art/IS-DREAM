15,01Dreamtime Serenade
15,01^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
15,01Half Past One
15,01And my subconscious mutters:
15,01"Regard that woman, standing in your dreams
15,01For she is your life, and your hope."
15,01I sunk to my knees and I prayed to the vision
15,01I sunk to my knees and I gave all of myself
15,01To the woman of sublime hope

15,01Half Past Four
15,01And my subconscious screams:
15,01"Disregard anything else in your dreams,
15,01Focus only on your one true desire!"
15,01I fell to the earth and my heart bled
15,01I fell to the earth and I gave all of myself
15,01To the woman of eternal beauty

15,01As the night ends
15,01My subconscious faintly whispers:
15,01"How does it feel to have found someone,
15,01Who is the extent of all of your dreams?"
15,01I took her in my arms and I shared my soul
15,01I took her in my arms and I gave all of myself
15,01For the sake of being one...
