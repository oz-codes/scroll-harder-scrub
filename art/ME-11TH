15,01                  04"Flores para los muertos..."
15,01                                    04- Tennessee Williams

15,01I turned to stare at the clock,
15,01And my course seemed fixed...
15,01I can feel it's fleeting thoughts...
15,01The clock struck the Sixth hour-

15,01Time echoing through every vortex of human convention,
15,01Breathing "loss" with every second gone,
15,01I can hear it coming close,
15,01Pass the Seventh hour-

15,01Every moment I live,
15,01I live...
15,01And if I am to be strong,
15,01I'll win...
15,01And now I see women waving goodbye to the Eighth hour-

15,01Dreams of a dimming sky,
15,01What lies in darkness we are tought to fear,
15,01I always thought if I could stare into the unknown
15,01     and not lose my sanity,
15,01I would be able to escape that insane ticking,
15,01Background music of our age,
15,01Escape the Ninth hour-

15,01Breathing sky,
15,01Bear down your flowers upon us...
15,01And with a short breath regret,
15,01Down a shot and forget,
15,01As the Tenth hour sneaks on bye-

15,01Here we stand,
15,01Ancient souls on their last battlefield,
15,01Our clothes, tattered,
15,01The flag is lost...
15,01Death come quick, but be swift,
15,01Youth, rise up,
15,01But it's burning now,
15,01Who could concieve what we leave behind?-

15,01What lies beyond
15,01In emptiness,
15,01I'll fill myself with a bottle,
15,01Here we sit,
15,01Buzzards perched on death,
15,01Perched on our Eleventh Hour-
