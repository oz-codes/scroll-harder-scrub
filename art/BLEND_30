15,01                     BABIES:  WHERE FROM THEY COME?

15,01Everyone digs cute little babies, right?  But from whence do these 
15,01bite-size bundles of squealing humanoid flesh orginate?  Our 
15,01man-on-the-street, Bartholomew J. (for "jestation) Simpson, put the 
15,01question to some of Springfield's finest.  Here are the answers we got.

15,01MARGE SIMPSON:  "Um...wait `til your father gets home and he'll 
15,01                explain it to you."

15,01HOMER SIMPSON:  "Go ask your mother."

15,01GRAMPA SIMPSON:  "Rabies?!!  Here--put this mustard plaster on your
15,01                 chest and you'll feel better in no time."

15,01JASPER:  "Scabies?!  Dagnabbit, you can tell?!!"

15,01BARNEY GUMBEL:  "Oh my God!  Am I pregnant again?!"

15,01MOE:  "Don't worry, Barney.  I'll make an honest man out of you."

15,01GROUNDSKEEPER WILLIE:  "Laddie, ask me again and you'll be 
15,01                       conducting yer wee survey from the bottom          
15,01                       of a well."

15,01KRUSTY THE CLOWN:  "Due to the voluminous amount of mail that Krusty 
15,01                   receives, he is unable to answer your question.  Keep 
15,01                   watchin', kids!"

15,01SIDESHOW MEL:  No answer/Honking noises

15,01KENT BROCKMAN:  "Babies?  Babies...let's see...hmmm...why don't you go 
15,01                ask that college intern over there?"

15,01EDNA KRABAPPEL:  "Shiftless husbands give them to their young and nubile 
15,01                 secretaries.  The best years of my life down the toilet and 
15,01                 now he's playing house with that bimbo from the typing 
15,01                 pool.  There, are you satisfied?"

15,01TODD FLANDERS:  "I'm not sure exactly, but you can go to Hell for asking 
15,01                that question."

15,01NELSON MUNTZ:  "From the looks of you I'd say the zoo.  Haw haw!"

15,01SHERRI AND TERRI:  "Duh!  Everybody knows the stork drops them down your 
15,01                   chimney!"

15,01JANEY POWELL:  "I think the milkman brings them."

15,01LEWIS:  "You call up and order one just like a pizza, only it takes nine 
15,01        months for delivery.  But if they deliver it late, the baby's free."

15,01MILHOUSE VAN HOUTEN:  "They're made at the North Pole by happy little 
15,01                      elves." 

15,01RALPH WIGGUM:  "My parents said they got me through a mail-order catalog."

15,01LISA SIMPSON:  "All I know is, you were the result of a biogenetic 
15,01               experiment gone awry.  But Mom and Dad swore me to secrecy, 
15,01               so if you ask them they'll deny it."
