15,01                    00You're nothing but a slave to the music
15,01                    00The metal reverberates inside your head
15,01                     00Sending in subliminal messages to all
15,01                     00"Shoot everybody and shoot them dead"
15,01                        00We become addicted to the power
15,01                    00We have no resistance at all against it
15,01                   00Although we fight and hang on to our lives
15,01                     00It fills us completely and hence it -
15,01                        00Is like a drug that we all love
15,01                       00We become entranced as it fills us
15,01                        00We move our bodies to the rhythm
15,01                       00We lose our senses and it kills us
15,01                          00No one can deny the power -
15,01                        00No one can deny the transfixtion
15,01                         00It is a disease without a cure
15,01                        00A disease called METAL ADDICTION!
