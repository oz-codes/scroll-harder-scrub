THIS MOVEMENT IS APART OF THE ANTI-SEC / ANTI-WHITEHAT MOVEMENT.

THIS IS NOT A JOKE READ THE ENTIRE FUCKING FAQ.

THIS IS THE SIMPLE #PHRACK FAQ:

keep this in mind: when speaking of phrack "magazine" we mean that whitehat
magazine on phrack.org. also we use examples, but this applies to all people
and websites that fall into these categories.

1) what is a whitehat?
a) A WHITEHAT IS ANYONE WHO HELPS THE SECURITY INDUSTRY (POSTING BUGS/INFO ETC)

2) are there greyhats?
a) NO, ONCE A PERSON HAS THE EVIL WHITEHAT WAYS INSIDE OF THEM, THEY BECOME A PURE WHITEHAT, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

3) how come "blackhats" are helping the security industry (bugtraq/phrack)?
a) THE SECURITY INDUSTRY INFECTS HACKERS WITH THESE EVIL THOUGHTS. THE
   SECURITY INDUSTRY BRAINWASHES HACKERS TO WORK FOR THEM (BY PUBLISHING THIS
   BUG/INFO/CODE INFORMATION). ALSO THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT BLACKHATS, THEY ARE
   WHITEHATS BASED ON QUESTION #2. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY DO NOT REALIZE IT.
   ALSO MOST OF THESE SO CALLED "BLACKHATS" DONT HACK. REAL HACKERS DO NOT 
   ACTUALLY PUBLICIZE SUCH INFORMATION (TO PHRACK BUGTRAQ ETC).

4) how is phrack a whitehat magazine?
a) EVERY TECHNIQUE THAT IS RELEASED IN PHRACK IS NOW REALIZED BY THE SECURITY
   INDUSTRY. THE SEC INDUSTRY NOW SPENDS TIME TO THWART THESE TECHNIQUES.

   ALSO, ALOT OF THE ARTICLES IN PHRACK DO NOT BENEFIT THE "HACKER SCENE"
   AT ALL. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT "POSITIVE" IDS ARTICLES OR HONEYPOT
   KEYLOGGERS MAKE THERE WAY INTO A "for hackers by hackers" MAGAZINE?

5) what are people like spaf/chris rouland/lance then?
a) THEY ARE THE ENEMY. WHITEHATS = ENEMY.

6) im confused, i thought k2 is a blackhat but he helps with honeypot?
a) HES NOT A BLACKHAT, HES A BAD ROLE MODEL FOR ALL HACKERS. HE IS 
   BRAINWASHED BY THE SECURITY SCENE. IF HE CHANGES - GOOD FOR HIM. IF HE
   CONTINUES HIS WAYS - HE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE ENEMY.

7) i get what you're saying now, so like k2/duke/horizon/scut (for example)
   aren't really hackers, they are just brainwashed by the security industry
   to work for them?
a) THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FUCKING CORRECT.

8) so what am i supposed to do?
a) STOP MAKING ANY OF YOUR INFORMATION PUBLIC. BY INFORMATION WE MEAN
   CODE,BUGS,TECHNIQUES ETC. KEEP THIS INFORMATION PRIVATE. DON'T TRADE
   IT ON IRC. DON'T ENTRUST THIS INFORMATION INTO INDIVIDUALS YOU DONT
   TRUST 100% (SOME PEOPLE TURN AROUND AND LEAK ALL YOUR SHIT OR THEY
   END UP SELLING IT TO ISS). AND FOR FUCKS SAKE, TRY ACTUALLY USING
   WHAT YOU CODE/FIND.

9) why do people like that whitehouse guy say "hackers shouldnt help criminals"
   or "hackers should help security industry by responsibly disclosing bug
   information to companies"?
a) THIS IS APART OF THE MASSIVE CAMPEIGN TO GET HACKERS TO WORK FOR THEM.
   THE FACT IS THAT IF THE "HACKING SCENE" DOESNT HELP THE SECURITY INDUSTRY,
   THEY WILL BECOME LOST BECAUSE THEY ARE A BUNCH OF COMPLETE IDIOTS. THE
   BEST BUGS/INFORMATION IS USUALLY GIVEN TO THE SECURITY INDUSTRY BY PEOPLE
   IN THE "HACK SCENE", AND THIS IS A FACT. IT MUST STOP.

10) how can i help?
a) HELP SPREAD THIS WAY OF THINKING TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW, ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE
   THEY ARE BEING BRAINWASHED AND PROFITTED OFF OF, THEY WILL CHANGE. IF YOU 
   WANT TO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE, START MAYBE THINKING ABOUT PROJECT MAYHEM.

11) ok, but like what if i dont want to change now? "lol"
a) YOU WILL BE HUNTED DOWN LIKE K2, DERAADT, DUGSONG, ETC. THE INTERNET
   IS NO LONGER SAFE FOR WHITEHATS. NO LONGER SAFE FOR THE SECURITY INDUSTRY.

12) what should whitehats think of this movement?
a) WHITEHATS/SECURITY INDUSTRY PEOPLE SHOULD BE AFRAID OF THIS MOVEMENT.
   IT SEEMS THAT HIGH MEMBERS OF THE SECURITY INDUSTRY HAVE ALREADY FALLEN
   VICTIM TO THIS MOVEMENT. THEY SHOULD STOP PUBLICLY MAKING AVAILABLE
   INFO SUCH AS "BUGS" OR "CODE" OR "TECHNIQUES". IF THEY DO NOT CHANGE
   THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE TARGETED, AND IT SUCKS TO GET OWNED/FIRED/
   PHYSICALLY BEATEN.

13) why does #phrack like DMCA?
   DMCA MAKES IT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN'T POST THESE BUGS/CODE ETC. READ UP
   ON IT. IT WILL BE A GREAT WEAPON FOR THIS MOVEMENT ONCE IT STARTS
   BEING ENFORCED ON A REGULAR BASIS.

14) ya ok, i think im going to change, this isn't some joke right?
a) NO IT ISN'T A JOKE. SECURITY INDUSTRY CANT SURVIVE AT ALL WITHOUT
   THE SELLOUTS & BRAINWASHED SECTION OF THE HACKER SCENE. CHANGE YOUR
   FUCKING WAYS. DONT POST. DONT HELP THE SECURITY INDUSTRY.

   STOP... BEING.... BRAINWASHED......................

THE END: written in 25 minutes by the PHC, so dont bug us.
