15,01                               00Peering Eyes


15,01                          00Malleable figures stood

15,01                     00and into the archway they looked.

15,01               00Staring steadily with their tearing lashes,

15,01                  00Between the cracks of sterile hallows,

15,01                          00the lightning looks.

15,01                     00From the corner of our lives,

15,01                              00They flash.

15,01                00Undressing our dreams with their states.

15,01                00Oh! Until the grasp they posed remained,

15,01                      00Fermenting in the darkness.
