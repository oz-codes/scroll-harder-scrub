15,01Voices

15,01Voices Screaming in my head
15,01Whispers stirring through my ears
15,01Only when I sleep are they finally dead
15,01When I awake in the morning, it is them I hear
15,01Forcing me to the edge of my sanity
15,01Laughing at me, Telling me lies
15,01Pushing me further away from reality
15,01Please god, just let me die.
15,01With the cold razor I inflict the wound
15,01Closing my eyes, I feel my life drain
15,01Knowing I'll be with the reaper soon
15,01With an final end to all this pain.
