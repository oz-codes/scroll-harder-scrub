15,01 i deserve more?
15,01 --------------
15,01 a friend and i went to a party
15,01 got there at 8 and we were tardy
15,01 bought some beer and found a seat
15,01 checked out the girls who seemed real sweet.
15,01 we started talking about the past
15,01 and present, but it couldn't last.

15,01 i told him of how i was smitten
15,01 with a woman of whom i've written.
15,01 he looked at me like i had bit him
15,01 and soon he said "tell me you're kiddin'".

15,01 "i swear it's true (he looked aghast)
15,01 it's been going on these six weeks past.
15,01 i had never noticed her before,
15,01 but her beauty you cannot ignore.
15,01 her mind and smile had captured this poet,
15,01 though it seems doubtful that she should know it."

15,01 these feelings will never come to light
15,01 because, alas, i'm just not bright
15,01 enough to express how i feel.
15,01 this backbone is NOT made of steel.

15,01 and so my friend he did ignore
15,01 the state in which i did implore
15,01 him to forget what i had said before

15,01 he simply said "you deserve more".
