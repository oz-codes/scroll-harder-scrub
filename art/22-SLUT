15,01packaged with colors and labels.
15,01forced into an appearance of "the COMMON man".
15,01everyone is the same, and we are created to be that way.
15,01this is the way to be cool.
15,01this is the way to get a girl.
15,01this is the way god wants us to be.
15,01this is society.

15,01society sucks.

15,01for many they have lost the realization of what makes them real.
15,01they do not see what else can be accomplished.
15,01they see each other under the labels.
15,01jock.  geek.  freak.  slut.  

15,01but without these labels we would all be friends.
15,01we would all be one label.

15,01there are those who set the labels.  there are those who rule society.
15,01society is their domain.  it is where they thrive, it is there comfort.
15,01but to the rest of US society is a whore.

15,01                whores are good..

15,01society calls me names.  society laughs in vain.
15,01but it does not realize itself.  it does not know it's own fucking self!
15,01society is a whore.

15,01                whores are good..

15,01i don't live in society.
15,01i hate society.
15,01i am against it's being, it's existance, and everything it stands for.
15,01because it stands for nothing.
15,01society is created to prosper.  for those within it to prosper.
15,01everyone outside must suffer.
15,01society is a whore.

15,01                whores are good..

15,01but outside of society there exists an alternative.
15,01that alternative is community.
15,01i live in community.
15,01we are all under that label.  community.
15,01community is good, because we are all friends.
15,01we all watch out for each other.  we all love each other.
15,01i love community.  i love it because it's the alternative to society.
15,01community is a slut.

15,01                it gives everyone a chance.  even if you
15,01                don't have the money.
