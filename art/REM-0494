15,01Radical Elite Movement: Monthly Newsletter [April 01,1994]
15,01   [INCORPORATED]


15,01        Another month another art packet.  Well this month is more like a
15,01Music Packet.  March: you could all say was a MARCH MADNESS.  It has been
15,01slow for all of my artists.  Even I having Finals.  Well good news this 
15,01month is that CoR merged with REM INC.  The merger was a success, it was
15,01made sometime during the middle of March.  Let's welcome former CoR -
15,01Founder/Prez : Magellan[REM INC/Sr.Member].  He will take care of internal
15,01duties within REM and also represent the group.  About 8 members from
15,01CoR is now in REM INC.  You can take a look at the new listings of all
15,01the names.  If I missed anyone please inform me.  One thing you should
15,01notice about the member listings is that I have not included the Member
15,01Boards anymore.  I figure your name will be on the list of members anyways.
15,01And that should indeed give you the credits that you need.  

15,01        Now back for this packet being more like a Music Packet.  One
15,01of the better West Coast Musicians is now with REM, the name is Nemesis.
15,01I'm proud to have him on our side.  Also listening to his great tunes,
15,01everyday I become a fan of his music.  He was also a CoR member.  A funny
15,01thing about it was that, he applied for REM membership, but a couple of 
15,01weeks later, that CoR and REM merger happened.  =)!  REM INC welcomes
15,01all of its NEW members.  Let's JAM!  

15,01        Bad News for this month:  Nisqually an EX-REM MEMBER!  Because of
15,01his GUILTY ANSI RIPPING!  Has blemished the REM name a bit.  He apparently
15,01ripped an ansi from a former Eternity member: Maestro.  I do apologize
15,01to Maestro that Nisqually had in fact ripped it.  I do not appreciate people
15,01jacking up the REM INC name for one silly persons acts.  I do not guarantee
15,01the artists I'm hiring aren't going to RIP off peoples artwork.  I do not
15,01have the knowledge of every single ansi ever produced.  So therefore I can't
15,01acuse anyone of ripping ansi's.  If you the viewer or critic let me know
15,01fine, but do not slander the good name of a group.  Since REM INC is one of
15,01the new budding groups, it is hard enough to get more members.  I'd be more
15,01appreciative if people would work toghether to help out groups from these
15,01worthless artists.  If ever so boldly Nisqually keeps that handle watch out.

15,01        Everyone in REM INC let's re-group and work our ASSES OFF!

15,01                        Sincerely,
15,01                                 Night Breed[REM-INC]
