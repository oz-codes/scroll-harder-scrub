15,01searched what he'd uncovered so far, and found the perfect cave. It was big,
15,01and high enough that no person would be finding it in the next few centuries.
15,01Besides, he knew for certain this was Hidden Mountain, the one who had beenave
15,01ignored in favour of the massive Rockies, and had not actually been explored
15,01until his twenty-first birthday, which had been a week before he'd upset Dlara

15,01scraping his exposed face like sandpaper. He drew a gloved hand across the

15,01from the ground. The tractor beam on the refridgerator was wobbling, and so he
15,01had to move faster. Somehow, he manuevered through the twisted, hollowed out
15,01path, and reached the small, six foot area that was its end.
15,01        Anger welled up inside of him, and for a moment it was strong enough to
15,01        There he set the fridge down on its back. He turned off the tractord
15,01beam, and clipped it to the pocket of the temp-suit. He had not brought theing
15,01helmet, only the suit. Now he opened the refridgerator and lay inside it.

15,01        The inside of the door was much different than a typical refridgerator.
15,01It had a butchered computer panel on it, and it was all ready for instruction..

15,01sealing himself in. Cold air swirled into the unit, and with it came a soothing

15,01stars laughing down at him. He kicked the ship. Hard. His numb toes tingled,
15,01        But as he drifted off, anxious questions rebounded in his mind. Would
15,01he even be able to be born if he wasn't there? Would there be two of him?
15,01Would Dlara know him? Would it work? What if he was discovered too early? He'd
15,01rigged the energy to travel in a loop, recharging itself, in a sense. But if
15,01that was disrupted before the programmed time, the energy would be lost, and an

15,01on to the ground.
15,01        But before he could worry anymore, he was dreaming, a dream that would
15,01last for millenia. At least he would be well-rested when he woke in 2304. If he
15,01woke.eally? The crash had felt like his ship had been ripped apart and slammed
15,01back together, the seams held with krazy glue. But now that he looked at it

15,01closed. As he opened the door fully and stepped in, the memories came rushing
15,01at him, organizing themselves in a sketchy sequence of events in his mind as
15,01he closed the door.

15,01        First there had been the warning. A blinking light, rousing him from
15,01his sleep. Then the urgent message droning through the empty corridors, "Losing
15,01velocity. Prepare for crash landing." He hadn't been able to correct the error,
15,01hadn't been able to pull the ship up. 

15,01        He remembered the shaking, the noise, every bolt of the small ship
15,01screaming as it spiraled down to meet the planet surface. Then there was the
15,01crash, jotling every bone in his body. And then there was silence, as he
15,01wondered if he was alive or not. Then the pain, assuring him that he was. And
15,01after that, the curiosity, the dazed need to explore...Getting up slowly,
15,01opening the door, and walking out onto what he'd hoped would be an inhabited
15,01planet.

15,01        And now he was back where he'd started. Cold, lost, and alone. Was he
15,01still in the Gamma-Triacus quadrent? Or had he crossed into the Krita solar
15,01system? Or had he gone through time instead of space, and ended up before his
15,01birth? In that case, no one would know he was missing.

15,01        Now he searched the dead ship for a blanket, rations, anything to keep
15,01his scramled mind occupied. Finally, he found the way to the small room that
15,01served as both sleeping quarters and leisure area. It had a few blankets,
15,01tossed from the broken bed, and a half-built refridgerator, empty. He'd been
15,01assembling that old Earth-style fridge for a month, occupying his ample spare
15,01time aboard Astriqu. He'd assembled and disassmebled it so many times, and now
15,01its insides lay strewn across the grey floor. He noticed a fridge-schematic
15,01crumpled unhappily under the massive appliance, which had probably rolled over
15,01many times during the crash.

15,01        He half-heartedly fiddled with the cooler mechanism, but his thawing
15,01hands shook, and he dropped it. He was hungry. Rations, rations, where were
15,01rations? Food first, then work. Eat, then see if Astriqu could be fixed. Yes,
15,01it seemed perfectly normal. Food was always a priority.
