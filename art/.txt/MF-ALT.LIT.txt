15,01Alternate Worlds Converge

15,01The lightning strikes harshly toward the lone tree
15,01Some things you just wouldn't notice if they weren't examined
15,01The crack of thunder quickly follows through
15,01Composition and position are carefully considered
15,01As a branch snaps and falls to the ground
15,01And the moment as we would like it remembered...
15,01While lower down blue sparks fly, like slow motion
15,01Is captured forever
15,01The odor of charred tree bark diffuses
15,01Where light is dark and dark is light
15,01While inconceivable calm rules the land
15,01Then developed never to be forgotten
