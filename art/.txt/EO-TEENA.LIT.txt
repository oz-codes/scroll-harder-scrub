15,01I am a Teenager

15,01I am a Teenager.
15,01Society says I am bad.
15,01Society says I'm rowdy, immature
15,01Society makes me mad.

15,01Does Society know me?
15,01Have grounds on which to judge?
15,01Is my record bad?
15,01No, not a smudge.

15,01I hate the class "Teenager"
15,01Which means so little yet so much
15,01I am not a cow in a herd
15,01And refuse to be treated as such

15,01Teenagers are not idiots
15,01Who just want to play
15,01We are intelligent human beings 
15,01Yet we earn low pay.

15,01We are not trusted at all
15,01"Trust you must earn"
15,01Says Society harshly
15,01Giving us no chance to learn.

15,01If we are given no respect
15,01How do we know how to act
15,01When we have it?
15,01We are shown no dignity or tact.

15,01We're immature, we're vandals
15,01We're "mischeivious scamps"
15,01We're all skaters
15,01Flying down ramps.

15,01The classes we are divided into
15,01Are only on the surface
15,01Skaters and rappers
15,01Serve a defiant teen purpose.

15,01Adults are classed as
15,01The acheivers, the doers,
15,01While we are the Fall of Society
15,01The rebel cows, the mooers.

15,01It's fear that makes adults distrust us
15,01Fear that when we mature, someday
15,01The world will be ours, not theirs
15,01And we'll run it in our own way.

15,01Out with the old, in with the teens
15,01We will run the world as we wish
15,01With our youthful ideas and cultures
15,01And the phrase "you are not a fish!"

15,01No wonder they're worried
15,01We'll be worried one day soon
15,01When we're the establishment
15,01We'll sing a different tune.

15,01Because there will be TEENS
15,01So different from us
15,01If we don't learn to let them grow
15,01The cycle goes on without fuss....
