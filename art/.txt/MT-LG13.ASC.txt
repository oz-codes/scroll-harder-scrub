15,01aOH.  2 months ago i was requested by him to run the full!ascii devision.     $

15,01I can't give the group no more, so I think it's time for someone younger and  $
15,01more energetic to get the leads.    I wish the group all the best mate,      nn
15,01 but I just don't see myself as a part of it. good luck, martz has quit the  *q
