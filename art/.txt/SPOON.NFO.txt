15,01| What is SPOON?           |
15,01+==========================+

15,01        SPOON is a utility to add SAUCE to your files.  If you don't know
15,01   what SAUCE is, you may want to check out SAUCE.TXT.  In short, SAUCE
15,01   stands for "Standard Architecture for Universal Comment Extensions".
15,01   SAUCE adds a full description to ANSi, Graphics, sound and several
15,01   more types of files.

15,01        In case you don't like SAUCE.  SPOON ][ will just as easily help
15,01   you to remove SAUCE.

15,01| What is SPOON ][ ?       |
15,01+==========================+

15,01        After a long time of 'managing' with SPOON, SPOON ][ was
15,01   developed.  It provides an improved user interface over the original
15,01   SPOON, and has several handy features that simply HAD to be there...
15,01   Things like detecting the size of several of the most common image
15,01   types.


15,01+--------------------------+
15,01|  How does it work ?      |
15,01+==========================+

15,01   SPOON is a very straightforward utility.

15,01        After typing SPOON at the DOS prompt, SPOON will load the list
15,01   of files in the path and present them to you.  You can use the
15,01   Up/Down cursor keys to select the file you want.  You will notice
15,01   the right window stating either "NO SAUCE" indicating the selected
15,01   file has no SAUCE, or it will contain the full SAUCE details.

15,01   Pressing [Enter] will select the file, and will put SPOON in SAUCE
15,01   edit mode, where you can modify what you want.  SPOON will do it's
15,01   best in autodetecting as much as possible.  If a file already has
15,01   SAUCE, no autodetection occurs.

15,01   Pressing [Enter] on a directory will make that directory active.

15,01   Pressing [Del] on a SAUCEd file will delete the SAUCE information.


15,01+--------------------------+
15,01|  SAUCE Edit mode         |
15,01+==========================+

15,01   The edit mode works like most input screens.  You can type the text
15,01   you want in the appropriate fields.  Pressing [F2] will allow you to
15,01   Select the Datatype and Filetype.

15,01   [Esc] brings you back to the file selection without saving any
15,01   modifications.  [F10] will save the SAUCE information and bring you back
15,01   to the file selection.


15,01+--------------------------+
15,01|  Customizing SPOON       |
15,01+==========================+

15,01   SPOON has very little SAUCE-related specifics hard-coded.  Most of
15,01   the SAUCE specs are defined in SPOON.INI, which you can modify to
15,01   your liking.  In addition to adding new filetypes and new
15,01   datatypes, you can modify the list of autodetected authors, and
15,01   the types of files you'll be using.  Check out SPOON.INI for
15,01   further details.  Everything for customizing SPOON is explained in
15,01   there.
