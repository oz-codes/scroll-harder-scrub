15,01Lady of all Shadows,
15,01guide me to teh darkness that I seek,
15,01I already know where it resides,
15,01But do you?
15,01You'll find it not far from the light, 
15,01Hiding not itself from the sun,
15,01Standing tall in stature,
15,01proud to be seen,
15,01So much to hide,
15,01all the more to reveal,
15,01Make good with what time it has,
15,01Express its pain through a beautiful mouth,
15,01Can you see in my words the location?
15,01of the shadow that I seek?
15,01The sun is showing at your face.
15,01The shadow begins... at your feet.

15,01                FrizzleFry -Havok
