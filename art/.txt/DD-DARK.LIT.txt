15,01"Darkness"

15,01I'm floating away and I feel lost
15,01Trying to get back no matter the cost.

15,01I'm in such a frenzy as I never knew
15,01Whipping and lashing but I have no clue.

15,01Where have I been?  Where am I going?
15,01It doesn't matter there's no good in knowing.

15,01The blackness is thick and closing around me
15,01Oh please oh god I cannot see!

15,01Hold my hand and pull me through.
15,01But you let me go as I knew you would.
