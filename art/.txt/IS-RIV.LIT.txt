15,01                00Try as you will, to escape lifes many parallels
15,01               00Your only sanctuary is the haven called Rivendell
15,01                 00Where the wild eyed stars and pristine towers
15,01                    00Bow and pray - before the eternal powers
15,01               00Which are seen at night, by the light of the moon
15,01                 00They rise before you out of the shadowy gloom
15,01                    00And speak to all those who will listen:

15,01                 00"I have come before thee to watch over you all
15,01               00To prevent the coming of Mankind's irreputed fall
15,01             00And to shine upon thee in your days of majestic glory
15,01                 00To climb the towers of heaven - story by story
15,01              00I have come to all of thee in this town of Rivendell
15,01               00To help thee in thy battle between heaven and hell
15,01                 00All lives who have lived and all those before
15,01              00Have found this to be the gateway to heaven's shore
15,01                  00I take thee in my hands and praise thee well
15,01                 00For thou art the heart and life of Rivendell!"
