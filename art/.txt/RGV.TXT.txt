15,01           First off, this is Jello typing, and i have NO idea
15,01             what FTL wants to put in this thing, or even if
15,01             he wants a .txt with it at all. But it's 4am here
15,01             and i'm NOT gonna call him to find out. =)
15,01             So if i fuck up, i'll let him bitch at me later,
15,01             for now, i'll live with it...

15,01           As of now, RGV is only has a works with command line
15,01             input, and has no dithering. By the next release
15,01             there will be a file lister and and interface,
15,01             posssibly even a VGA interface. The dithering may
15,01             be implemented by the next release but that is
15,01             indefinate at this point.

15,01           This proggy was coded by FTL maily for the fuck of it.
15,01             It's nothing special right now, but it has a really
15,01             smooth fade in/out, it's pretty quick, and is rather
15,01             tiny. It'll be better soon, and untill then, fuck it.
