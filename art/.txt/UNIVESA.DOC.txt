15,01What is it?
15,01-----------

15,01The Universal VESA TSR is a small Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program
15,01that provides extends the Video BIOS routines of SuperVGA video cards
15,01to make them compatible with the Video Electonics Standards Association
15,01(VESA) recommended extensions.

15,01By having a video card that has a VESA compatible BIOS, or by installing
15,01this small TSR, programs that support the VESA programming interface
15,01will work correctly for your SuperVGA. This helps to solve a lot of
15,01problems with compatibility between different SuperVGA cards on the
15,01market.

15,01Why use it?
15,01-----------

15,01You may already have a VESA TSR for you video card, or you video card
15,01may have a VESA compatible BIOS already, so why would you want to use
15,01this program?

15,01The simple answer is that most of the TSR's that exist today, and a lot
15,01of the not-so-new SuperVGA cards that are around implement an older version
15,01of the VESA programming interface (if any at all). For this reason, some
15,01programs that use the advanced features of the new VESA standard will
15,01not work with the TSR or BIOS that you currently have.

15,01So what advanced features does this TSR provide that other's don't? The
15,01Universal VESA TSR implements the VESA Version 1.2 programming interface,
15,01which supports the following features:

15,01    - VESA page flipping. High performance animation programs can
15,01      use your card to full potential using the VESA BIOS to implement
15,01      extended page flipping (imagine, 1024x768x16 double buffered
15,01      animation, or even 800x600x256 and 640x400x32k/64k on a 1Mb video
15,01      card!!).

15,01    - Support for the 32k, 64k and 16 million color video modes. As well
15,01      as supporting the industry standard 16 and 256 color video
15,01      modes.

15,01    - Speed. The bank switching code in this package tends to run faster
15,01      than the routines embedded in the VIDEO BIOS of some video cards.

15,01Hardware Requirements
15,01---------------------

15,01The Universal VESA TSR contains '386 dependant code, so it will only
15,01run on machine that have and 80386 or better CPU. Currently the
15,01Universal VESA TSR supports the following SuperVGA chipsets (note that
15,01not all of these have been fully tested):
