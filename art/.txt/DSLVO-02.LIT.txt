15,01          "Turn here." signalled the black man, riding shotgun. 
15,01The driver, already pulling the needle past the 80 mile per hour
15,01mark, banked hard left and raced down 4th Street, gunning the
15,01engine and pushing the car to an incredible 105 miles per hour. 
15,01The diesel engine whined, being pushed past its theoretical
15,01limit.  The needle crept towards 120 miles per hour.

15,01          "OK, everyone," the black man said icily. "We're two
15,01minutes away.  Keep y'uzis ready.  Thomas, keep them grenades
15,01handy, we might meet up with some tards in body armour.  Everyone
15,01ready?"

15,01          Collectively, the contents of the car let out a
15,01nervously held breath.

15,01          "Ready, Sir." they replied in unison.

15,01          Arthur Sand settled down into the plush leather of the
15,01passenger side seat.  No-one said a word.  They'd all been
15,01through enough of these raids to know not to talk just before the
15,01kill.  It disturbed the Captain.

15,01          "Sir, we're almost there," announced Clair, the fat
15,01rookie with the wen beside his nose.  "I can see it in the
15,01distance."

15,01          Good, thought Sand.  We'll wait a couple seconds for
15,01the homegrowns to come out.  The junkies gotta get their fill,
15,01don't they?  He laughed silently to himself.  

15,01          "Once you see the first camera lens come out, slow down
15,01to drive-by speed. Everyone else, roll down your windows."  Sand
15,01pronounced it windaz.  He flipped the safety off of his assault
15,01rifle and opened up the sunroof.  "Let's rock."

15,01          Clair saw some heads pop out of a deserted pill box,
15,01and slowed the car sufficiently to get the needle down to 25. 
15,01Another few looked out of the windows of the shabby Old Town
15,01slums, some others, wasted 10 storey duplexes.  Sand gave all the
15,01little kids the finger.  

15,01          The first flash went off just before the house came
15,01into view - it was a victorian ripoff bungalow with cracked
15,01plaster on its walls.  Two skinny kids, not more than 9 or 10
15,01years old, were out on the porch passing a paper bag, trying to
15,01look grown up.  The taller one had a cigarette smouldering
15,01nervously in his fingers.  They didn't know what hit them.  

15,01          "TAKE 'EM DOWN!!!" Sand cried.  God this is fun, he
15,01thought, as he shot the kids on the porch.  More cameras
15,01materialized out of nowhere.  A second flash captured their
15,01agonized death poses.  Sand grinned as the paper bag hit the
15,01sidewalk, shattering the bottle inside.  He made a mental note to
15,01make sure the newsies got that on tape.

15,01          The house was lost amid a torrent of camera flashes and
15,01gunfire.  Bullets rained upon the cheap house, covering it in
15,01powdery bullet holes.  Glass shattered and fell upon the dead
15,01bodies on the front porch, producing several new uncontrollable
15,01haemorrhages.  Sand grinned as his assault rifle belched a
15,01fantastic display of yellow fire from its muzzle.  Thomas and
15,01Arland, both armed with tank quality cannons, opened fire as the
15,01cruiser met the house side by side.  Two white men, both armed
15,01with ancient .22 calibre revolvers, appeared behind successive
15,01broken windows, futilely protecting the people inside.  They were
15,01mowed down instantly, sandwiched between slug after bloody slug.

15,01          "Eat this, you bastards!" A skinny old man, dressed
15,01only in overalls and his beard, appeared in the driveway with a
15,01large, automatic rifle.  Sand was momentarily taken aback at this
15,01crazed maniac - where in the hell did he get that gun?? Sand
15,01thought.  But only for a second.  The old man aimed at the
