15,01        to get a viewer, but there's a tons of viewer out there already.

15,01        I (P-chan) got lazy on our first release, dumped a bunch of my old
15,01        shit into the pak, but I got my act together this month.  So I'll
15,01        bring the best of my art talent to STX.  I can only be reached on
15,01        Killer BBS or Luxor Crew, all 619 boards gets a discount for any ansi
15,01        by me. I might set up a bbs this summer, dedicated to many talented
15,01        artists out there.  Looking for an area to show their work.  Sorry
15,01        Neurotic, I couldn't give you the gif earlier this month, but I
15,01        included in the pak, so go ahead and take it. :)
