15,01It was a sad day for all mankind.  Everyone suddenly realized how much
15,01everything sucked.  So they burned it all.  Absolutely everything.

15,01So they were left with a barren planet, and 5 billion people.  Well, what else
15,01were they supposed to do?

15,01They played a really big game of leapfrog around the equator.  Eventually that
15,01got boring, so they played tag.  But with only one "it" and 5 billion people,
15,01it got boring REALLY fast for a lot of people.  Especially the eskimos, who
15,01only got to play once in the whole twenty-three years.

15,01So, the only thing left for them to do was gather around the campfire and tell
15,01stories.  Unfortunately they had nothing to burn, so they decided to burn Dave.
15,01 They didn't have anything to burn him with so they just left him in the sun
15,01for a real long time, and he got very red and warm.  So people gathered around
15,01Dave and began to tell stories.  They told funny stories, and sad stories, and
15,01scary stories... well, eventually everyone got tired, so they pissed on Dave to
15,01extinguish him, and they all went to sleep.

15,01Now this is where the story gets complicated.

15,01News reporters announced that cosmic forces were going to tear the world in
15,01half, so half the earth and anything on it would go hurtling into the sun and
15,01burn up, and the other half would shoot off into space and eventually freeze.

15,01Now, they didn't have TVs, so they just went around telling everyone this
15,01stuff.

15,01So, everyone gathered around the equator, so when it broke apart, they could
15,01choose which half they were on.  They all waitied in silence for the world to
15,01split.

15,01And then suddenly, it did.  But unfortunately, it split around the
15,01international date line, eastern hemisphere from western.  The people didn't
15,01like this at all so they killed the news reporters.

15,01So, the eastern hemisphere hurtled toward the sun, and the western hemisphere
15,01flew off into space.

15,01The eastern hemisphere didn't have a good time at all.  People got really tired
15,01running around it, trying to keep from being on the hot side, which was hot
15,01enough to melt lead, had there been any lead left.  The western hemisphere
15,01wasn't so bad off.  They just really wished they had sweaters, and had not
15,01burned them.

15,01Eventually, the eastern hemisphere crashed into the sun.  Those people got
15,01really dark tans really fast, but then they stopped being people and started
15,01being just a few molecules floating around in a big ball of flaming gas.  All
15,01in all, still better than a career as a politician.

15,01The people on the western hemisphere were really getting cold.  They all
15,01huddled together for warmth.  Twelve preachers from Arkansas thought that all
15,01these naked people huddling together was sick, and banished them all from the
15,01western hemisphere.  So, they all disembarked at Io, and left the twelve anal
15,01retentive naked preachers to freeze to death.

15,01Io was not named after anything to do with DOS.  I don't know what it's named
15,01after, but trust me, this baby has been around a lot longer than Bill Gates.

15,01The people on Io were getting really hungry.  They didn't have any food, so
15,01they looked around for the local 7-11.  They found one, but realized to their
15,01dismay that 7-11 doesn't have anything worth eating.  So they all just decided
15,01to buy a pack of smokes.  Unfortunately they had burned all of their ID.  They
15,01were all shocked that Canadian law applied on Io, and that it was actually
15,01another province.  7-11 was starting to suck so they burned it too.

15,01It burned real nice.  Much better than Dave.
