15,01. . .Temporal Distortion. . .



15,01Standing in the twilight, I raise my hands to the rain;
15,01Let the droplets fall and cleanse the pain.

15,01Let the lightning flash and the night wind roar;
15,01Search my soul, all it's hidden doors.

15,01Search my heart, let the blood beat inside;
15,01Bare my soul open, leave nothing to hide

15,01Weight of compulsion drawing me under;
15,01Taste the allure of eternal black thunder.

15,01See hollow clouds roll against the darkening sky
15,01As illusions fade before my eyes. 

15,01Beneath my feet, the charred earth quakes;
15,01Up from the deep rises a twisted black gate.

15,01Choice to be made as I stand at the cross;
15,01Risks to be lived or opportunities lost.

15,01No time to think, no time for emotion;
15,01I place one foot forward and set action in motion.

15,01Visions fade to blood-red as I sink into the light;
15,01Senses are dead, the final good-night.

15,01Spiral falling and screaming - maniacal intorsion;
15,01Drowned in the vortex of Temporal Distortion.
