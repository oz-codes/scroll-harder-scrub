00,01I sit here tapping away as I gaze into my mind
00,01I see hatred punishment (TicNTic) anger
00,01and flowers
00,01I see a catepillar in a coccoon
00,01As it takes upon a new body I notice something different
00,01It turns...........turns into a dragon
00,01A dragon filled with hate, anger
00,01and shame
00,01I see a tiger recieving abuse she does not deserve
00,01For she is the sunlight that shines
00,01shines in the dragon's heart
00,01The dragon listens to nothing
00,01as it does as it pleases
00,01and will bring down anyone in it's path
00,01yet he has a feeling that this is not right
00,01still he continues on his warpath TicNTicNTicNTic
00,01the tiger escapes from the pain
00,01and is tearing the dragon apart from the inside
00,01but he still fights, fights harder then ever
00,01as he leads himself away from his conscience
00,01and lets his anger free
00,01free to reek havoc on the land
00,01The dragon is growing TicNTicNTicNTic
00,01his conscience tells him to get help
00,01but he ignores the cries of mercy
00,01for he is truly evil and should be killed TicNTic
00,01To this day they still fight
00,01They fight within myself for I am the dragon........
