15,01 
15,01     Hey, whats up out there in the art scene?  This is Kurse, here
15,01  again, to tell ya what's new and what's not with CRiME.. I have 
15,01  felt really burnt out with the 'Scene', and computers in general
15,01  recently, so i didn't do all that much this month.  Oh well, mabey
15,01  next month.. Let's See, who's new in CRiME?  Oblivion is a newcomer
15,01  who has shown some real rapid improvement, and, in my opinion, shows 
15,01  some real potential.  Oblivion also writes lits, but i wasn't able to
15,01  obtain any for this pack.  In the next pack you should be able to see
15,01  some, plus some more of his ansi.  Another Newbie to the group is 
15,01  Quisling.  Quisling has some decent [really decent] VGA's, especially
15,01  for just starting a few months ago, and is also a good producer.  He
15,01  does lits too, so be sure to check them out along with his .GIF's.  
15,01  Hindu, a new coder, has been added too.  He doesn't have anything in
15,01  this pack, but in the next pack, you should be able to see some more of
15,01  his stuff.  Menace, a talented ansi artist, has joined the ranks.  He 
15,01  also runs the CHQ, Black Sunday, which is acting as WhQ, so be sure to
15,01  give it a call at 314-343-8606.  Nuke has been added for ANSi and 
15,01  will be couriering to the Internet.  His board, Utopia, has been added
15,01  as a member board.  Jabberw0cky has been made Courier Coordinator, and 
15,01  should do a much better job couriering, as our former Coordinator has had
15,01  his monitor fried, and hasn't had much luck.  This pack should get spread
15,01  a lot better than the previous one.  Jabberw0cky will also be coding, so 
15,01  you should see a few things from him sometime in the near future.  
15,01  Finally, Pitt has been added as a trial member, but still shows some 
15,01  good potential, so you shall see more of him in the upcoming packs.
15,01     Hmmmm, what else is new?  Dagon has changed his name to Shadow Image.
15,01  Zypher has changed his name to Memphisto.  I would suggest checking out 
15,01  his newest mod, Mix.mod, which is a cool mix of some kickin shit.  
15,01  Gideon's CD messed up, and screwed up his board, so he has been busy 
15,01  trying to fix that, and hasn't been able to produce too much.  Spore's
15,01  Computer was fried somehow, so you won't see anything from him in this
15,01  pack either.  I wasn't able to get the .MOD's from Master V this month,
15,01  due to him going on vacation and me being out of town at coordinating bad
15,01  times, so you should hear his stuff next pack.  There have been a few 
15,01  departures this month.  War Pig has quit, and is no longer BBSing much at
15,01  all.  I wish him luck if he decides to get back into art.  Impact has also
15,01  left us, due to conflicts with members, including myself, so i hope he
15,01  does good wherever he decides to go.
15,01     Oh, because of the busy-ness of our coders, and studying for finals,
15,01  we have included VPIC to view the .GIF's.  I know this is cheezy as hell,
15,01  but I hope you all will be able to forgive me <G>.  
15,01     I will be moving in about a week, so the next pak may be delayed a 
15,01  little.  I'll be seein ya all up in 718 in a few weeks, though, and will
15,01  probally be putting up a board up there, so be ready for it.  
15,01     Guess that ends the news for this month.  I lost all the applications,
15,01  so if you sent one in, please send it again.  Just email to me on Black 
15,01  Sunday, and i'll be sure to get it there.  We are still looking for another
15,01  good coder or two, and some distro sites.  I lost like 10 app's for distro
15,01  site's, so if ya made one, please take the time to fill it out again.  
15,01  Artists are always welcome, so if your freelance, come on up this way.  
15,01  Well, i'll be seein ya next month, or mabey in two, depends on how busy
15,01  I am with movin.  Till then, have fun.. oh, wait, what would a newsletter 
15,01  be without greets?!
