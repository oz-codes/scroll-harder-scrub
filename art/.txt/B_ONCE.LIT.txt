15,01once
15,01once i knew
15,01i knew it all
15,01then i grew up
15,01and i knew nothing
15,01pushed down by people who think they know everything
15,01having the nothing shoved down my throat
15,01i do not want your nothing
15,01i want to find something for myself
15,01i do not need your help
15,01all you do is discourage me
15,01"no you are doing it wrong"
15,01"no what you think is wrong"
15,01"no your opinion has no meaning"
15,01if i were a cat i would be free.
15,01free to contemplate the meaning of it all
15,01if i were a fish i could swim effortlessly through it all
15,01but i am a bipedal hairless ape
15,01the most helpless animal on the planet
15,01the most ignorant animal on the planet
15,01do not teach me your ways of destruction

15,01you will destroy yourself
15,01you will come crying to me

15,01and i will help you because i am a compassionate person

15,01but i only forgive, when I am wrong.

15,01remember that.

15,01friend.
