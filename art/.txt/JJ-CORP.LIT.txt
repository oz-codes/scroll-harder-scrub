15,01corporations..

15,01they're caught.
15,01they rely on ignorance.
15,01they breed monotony.
15,01they need dumb people.

15,01BUT
15,01the drive for cash
15,01is so great they allow
15,01some learning.

15,01I wonder if those
15,01who are learned
15,01realize
15,01they are just
15,01flesh
15,01puppets ?

15,01and that they have power ?
15,01they can change things..
15,01if they aren't seduced by the machine
15,01that trained them.

15,01soon
15,01true education
15,01will be too expensive.
15,01look at the budget cuts.
15,01too expensive for us.

15,01corporations will subsidize research.
15,01corporations will educate their employees.

15,01universities and colleges will be obsolete.

15,01fuck.
15,01this is happening in front of our faces.
15,01learn while you still can my friends...
15,01take it upon yourself to seek knowledge everyday.
15,01teach yourself to learn.
15,01read books.

15,01fear of the machine.
