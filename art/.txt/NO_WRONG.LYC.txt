15,01'I Can Do No Wrong'  By PigFace off of their FOOK album


15,01take a look outside, because I'm walking on glass,
15,01then I say the future, on a voice from the past.
15,01forsaken dreams again, in the four way zone,
15,01better look outside, because I'm coming alone.
15,01better look outside, because I'm coming alone.

15,01how many nights before, I sang an innocent song,
15,01rejoicing in my ignorance, I could do no wrong.
15,01take a look outside, for the first time afraid,
15,01outside the glass was shattered, where one time we laid.
15,01outside the glass was shattered, where one time we laid.

15,01I could do no wrong,
15,01I could do no wrong,
15,01I could do no wrong, 
15,01I could do no wrong,

15,01so I drowned my emptyness, between lie after lie,
15,01I poured myself another, and then started to cry.
15,01SHAME On you for weakness, go back where you belong.
15,01I poured myself another, I could do no wrong.

15,01I could do no wrong,
15,01I could do no wrong,
15,01I could do no wrong,
15,01I could do no wrong.
