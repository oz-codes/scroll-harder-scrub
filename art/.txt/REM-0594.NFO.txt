15,01The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.
15,01Attitude, to me is important than facts.  It is more important than
15,01the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, failures,
15,01than success, than what other people think or say or do.  It is more
15,01important than appearance, giftedness, or skill.  It will make or break
15,01a company... a church... a home.  The remarkable thing is you have a
15,01choice everyday regarding the attitude you will embrace for that day.
15,01We cannot change our past...  We cannot change the fact that people
15,01will act in certain ways.  We cannot the innevitable...  the only thing
15,01we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our ATTITUDE.

15,01I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react
15,01to it.  And so it is with you...  you are in charge of your ATTITUDE.

15,01(this is one of our little mottos in my school, I thought I should share
15,01 with the REM (INC) crew.) -NB..  ps: I don't know who wrote this. =).


15,01May pack!  The REM INC mission pack has been released on the third.        
15,01Looks like we will never be on schedule.  I'd like to welcome
15,01Digital Raper and Killer Bee.  Both are new couriers for REM and 
15,01DR will also be doing some fli's and vga's...  Like to say what's going
15,01on with the new boards I've added, we'll try and find you couriers.
15,01Bear with us.  

15,01New things in the member list.  I deleted the people who didn't 
15,01contribute anything for this month.  This will be my new policy from
15,01now on.  I don't feel that they should be credited if they didn't 
15,01release anything.  I'm sure all of you, understand my point of view.
15,01So in this case, say I didn't draw anything, I won't even have my name
15,01in the artists list.  =)...  So I suggest you guys keep it up.

15,01Musicdisk.  The first REM INC musicdisk has been released.  Along
15,01with this month's art packet.  I guess that will be always the case.
15,01Two separate files for the REM fanatico club.  I'd like to thank  
15,01Nemesis and Fraud for contributing with the music this month.

15,01I'm pretty much thrashed and not in the right mind to write anything,
15,01so I'll go straight to the shots out to:  Brainz/Nemesis/Digital Raper/
15,01Magellan/Fraud.  And to the other people who know me out there in the
15,01Art Scene.  Yawning out :  Night Breed[rem]
