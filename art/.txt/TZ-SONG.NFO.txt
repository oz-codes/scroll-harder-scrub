15,01Title: that gunk...


15,01the last 4 posts... well, i wrote all those today whilst listening to
15,01music...  the part about "the voice of god" resembles that bad religion
15,01song... it fit too...  just like the "circle of tears" part in "humanity"...

15,01one day i'd like to perform those.  right now i HAVE to perform one of them -
15,01my english mark relies on that.  blah.

15,01you may notice similarities to songs you've heard, i was probably listening to
15,01it at the time...

15,01oh well, why did i post that? i dunno.. i think merlyn's message sort of
15,01motivated me to open up a bit more.. the thoughts and ideas there are
15,01"expected" i suppose by my english teacher, but i think most of them hold true
15,01with me...

15,01oh well.

15,01for some weird reason i posted in the opposite order i wrote them... oh well..
