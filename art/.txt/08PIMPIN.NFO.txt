15,01ahh.. the land of pimpedia, the legend of pimpedia.  what the hell am i talking
15,01about?  it's simple.  but,  just to give you a blunt idea of what im getting at
15,01our friend discyple, has brought up the most significant, understandable notes
15,01that have been read, to date;

15,01133.  newschool: Pimp.  In  classical mythology,  the river
15,01of forgetfulness, from which pimps drank before being born.
15,01In Noname's symbolism it flows down from the top of Harlem,
15,01where it washes away the  memory of sin from the souls that
15,01have achieved purity.  That memory  it delivers  to Motown,
15,01which draws all ascii to itself.
15,01143.  pimp:  As part of their total symbolism,  Noname ends
15,01each of  the  three divisions of  the  Pimpedia  with  this
15,01word.   Every conclusion of the upward  style is toward the
15,01stars: Noname's shining pimp-medallions of hope and virtue.
15,01It is  just before  dawn of  Easter Sunday  that the  Pimps
15,01emerge - The Boardwalk.
15,011.  on march the banners  of the pimp:  The hymn  (Vexilla
15,01pimpis  prodeunt)  was  written  in the  sixth century  by
15,01Venantius  Fortunatus,  Bishop of  Pimpedia.  The original
15,01celebrates  the Platform Shoe,  and is part of the service
15,01for Noname to be sung at the moment of releasing a pack.

15,01XOXOXOXO,
15,01discyple

15,01-- thank you, discyple.

15,01NOW.. the pimpedia, is explained in FULL above.. those excerpts were taken from
15,01the banners of the pimp, as written by Venantius <seen above>.. they were found
15,01in the sacred land  of brooklyn, by Lord Cain,  and his partner in glory,  Lord
15,01Discyple smoking blunt, and we cant forget Lord SavageDragon, the master of the
15,01funkiness.  these three men, were relaxing, with their riches, and a carload of
15,01beautiful women at the soul shack.. natrually, they got bored, so they all satt
15,01down  at the planning  table.  as  they sat at the table, a vision came to them
15,01simultaneously..  a mountain, which in  it's oddity,  was shaped in  the  words
15,01'Pimpedia.'  the founders of the phearsome  noname brand ascii looked about, in
15,01awe..  and decided to pack up the  warriors of the noname brand, and move along
15,01to this vision they saw.. the 'Pimpedia.'  the warriors agreed, and so.. in all
15,01curiousity, they followed their dreams.  amongst the journey,  which took place
15,01in the month of january, 1997.. some warriors we're lost in battle, those peeps
15,01include; the ever present spinsane, and c4nnibass -- we'll misss you gentleman,
15,01your  spots in  the tribe still stand.   tek,  although we never saw  much from
15,01him .. has left to join another tribe the 'serial' vikings, along with him went
15,01midnight judge, and i *think* revert.  rebellious warriors this month,  include
15,01nytmare, and x3nocide.  and in all respects, defiant left the warrior tribe due
15,01to his lack of 'want,' to do ascii.  you are all missed,  an AWOL ascii warrior
15,01is never a good thing. NOW.. as the journey continued, Lord Cain, Lord Discyple
15,01Lord Polymorph, and Lord SavageDragon..  discovered the banners  of the pimp in
15,01which, their tribe 'Noname Brand Ascii' was mentioned numerous times.. was this
15,01an omen?  ..  the Lords decided  to give up the warrior looks,  and move on, to
15,01what the scrolls described them wearing; Platform Shoes, Pink Fedoras, Mink Fur
15,01Coats, Large Baggy Jeans\Pants, Conservative Sweaters, Colored Golf Visors, and
15,01last, but not least.. the 'Cane'.. baring their individual ascii drawing tools.
15,01people liked this idea.. but it was unanimous that they  would stay warriors at
15,01heart, and so they  would be called  'The Noname Warrior Pimps' .. people liked
15,01this idea, and so  decided to join the ranks,  of the newly founded 'pimpedia,'
15,01those people include; The Natural, Metalman, Druid, Super 88,  and Shamen.  plz
15,01welcome the new guys to the pimp tribe.  so.. on the  ever going journey to the
