15,01        What the heck is he trying to say to me?  The words, neatly chosen, 
15,01bear meaning enough on their own, but in these arrangements they serve no 
15,01seeming use in their intended use for communication.

15,01        My dog has always been a mystery to me.  He always attempts his 
15,01primitive form of communication, barking, on me.  Why?  I mean, wouldn't it 
15,01be easier for him to point to his dog-disk to say that he's hungry?  No, not 
15,01for him, he has to BARK for three hours!  Well, I've had enough of his 
15,01barking and biting!  His pushing me down the steps and shoving me into 
15,01traffic.  Yesterday, while walking to the store, he ran ahead of me to 
15,01confront another canine.  At first I thought this was kind of cute, my dog 
15,01making friends, but then both dogs charged at me causing me to fall into a  
15,01fairly large mud puddle.

15,01        I became angry.  So very angry.  I could feel the blood boil inside 
15,01me.  I could feel my clothes burning away.  I could see my body changing.

15,01        Writhing in pain,I curled into a little ball in the dirty little mud 
15,01puddle.  My muscles bunched and grew.  My skin turned bright orange.  I was 
15,01becoming the beast once more.

15,01        "NOOOO!"  I yelled,  "Not now!  Not in front of the dogs!!"

15,01        Inside my head I heard his deep and menacing voice.

15,01        "Peter... Peter... there is no use, Peter.  Don't be a moron... kill 
15,01the dogs, Peter."

15,01        "No... I can't... they're so furry and sweet..."

15,01        "YOU STUPID BASTARD.  DON'T YOU SEE?  THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO KILL 
15,01YOU.  KILL THEM FIRST, PETER.  KILL THEM ALL..."

15,01        "Yes... I MUST."

15,01        I stood up, and my body was unrecognizable.  I grabbed Stu, my dog.

15,01        Stu, the dog I raised from birth.  The cute little ball of fluff.  
15,01Not noticing all of this I took him up in one fist.

15,01        "I must kill, I must, I must.  They will be the death of me - can't 
15,01happen.  Aaaghh!  And his little friend too.  Blood.  Dirt.  I want their 
15,01blood!"

15,01        Taking their little pointy heads in my mouth I chewed and chewed, 
15,01but the damned things wouldn't crush.  It was as if they were made out of 
15,01rubber.

15,01        The voice in my head grew louder.

15,01        "Crush them, Peter,before theey crush you - DO IT."

15,01        "... I'm trying already, would you shut up?"

15,01        And then it started to rain.  Oh, how I hate rain.  At last out of 
15,01pure frustration, I swallowed the two dogs whole and alive.  Heh, heh... 
15,01suckers.  But wait, what's this?  My stomach is expanding!  Owww!  What the
15,01......  What's  happening?  It's stretching...

15,01                                        POW

15,01        Out of the hole in my stomach my dog Stu flew out.  His whole body 
15,01began to shake as if he was possessed by the devil, and he began to grow, 
15,01and grow.  His eyes became  bright red and his fur turned green.  My 
15,01beautiful Stu.  For the moment I forgot my own condition.  Then the voice 
15,01began to speak to me again.

15,01        "What are you, stupid?  Can't you see... he's bigger than you.  
15,01Leave - leave, get away!  Run, you moron!"

15,01        I ran and ran.  And ran some more.  I ran a bit and I ran a lot.  
15,01Well, I only ran half a block, before, well, I fell down.  That's what 
15,01happens when one is out of shape, I guess.  Then,  Stu trotted up beside me, 
15,01licking my face.

15,01        "Aw, Stu old buddy, how could I become so mean to you?"

15,01        "Kill him, Peter, kill him now!"

15,01        I suddenly noticed somebody behind the bushes.  I sent Stu to get
