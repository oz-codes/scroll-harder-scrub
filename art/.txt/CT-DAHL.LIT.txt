15,01MERRY CHRISTMAS, DAHLINK

15,01Bombarded by an onslaught of emotions so intense
15,01That the essence of my being, overwhelmed without defense.

15,01Your face has taken residence inside my pulsing heart
15,01Of me, your blissful freedom will forever be a part.

15,01You incite me to act childlike, and I do so without quail,
15,01Confident that I'm the basis of your mental model male.

15,01Why is it that I write, with whatever cursed ease,
15,01These words which one would have to say bent upon one's knees?

15,01I know not what to propose, but something for all time.
15,01To have taken from us what we found would be a vile crime.

15,01Perpetual love, respect and whatever.
15,01Now and for always, tomorrow, forever.


15,01Dedicated to Eoanya, the single person in the world who knows me the best.
