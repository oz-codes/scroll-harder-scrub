15,01                              Running to flee
15,01                              Running to hide
15,01                            Escaping  the demon
15,01                              Persuing behind

15,01                               Cutting  left
15,01                               Cutting right
15,01                            The demon continues
15,01                             Destined to fight

15,01                            Plotting  my escape
15,01                             Plotting my route
15,01                            My only  conclusion
15,01                             Rise to  the bout

15,01                            Preparing to battle
15,01                             Preparing to duel
15,01                              Acting in haste
15,01                         I lunge towards the ghoul

15,01                            The blade is in hand
15,01                           The blade  is extended
15,01                             Exerting my  might
15,01                            Yet still he defended

15,01                            His counter was dodged
15,01                           His counter  was blocked
15,01                            We gazed at  eachother
15,01                          Our eyes they  were locked

15,01                            The staredown continued
15,01                           The  staredown  consisted
15,01                            Of two  warring enemies
15,01                            Yet  still we persisted

15,01                            The fight never ceases
15,01                             The fight never dies
15,01                              Continuing forever
15,01                            With a meriod of cries
