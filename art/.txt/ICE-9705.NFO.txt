15,011.  April showers  brought May flowers,  that is,  until Joker  came around and
15,01accidentally stepped on all of them.  Oh well.   But we have a great variety of
15,01work  this month  to make up  for it!   We  wanted to call  it the "iCE Flowers
15,01Month" but BoA  said it sounded too gay,  and Dev mentioned something about his
15,01possibly getting deflowered so it became a moot point.

15,012.  In the "who's new" department, sometimes referred to as the "suckers of the
15,01month club",  we are happy to report  that three new members were welcomed into
15,01the group.   Sucked in by the Frozen Eureka were Farmicus in the UNIX team, and
15,01Wired in the ANSI/members team.  Also dragged in half-dead by the cat (Scooter)
15,01was Beastie, to the ANSI team.  Nobody managed to escape this month, either.

15,013.  Information Systems director Lickbert never bothered learning to use a real
15,01writing  implement,  so he's been  moved to  'progressive discipline.'   He was
15,01taken there by Jae,  who will be administering the torture.   However, Farmicus
15,01and Force Ten report that many new UNIX tricks will be put in place this month.
15,01They're all a secret, and neither are willing to tell.

15,014.  Tempus resurfaced to  socialize with the  wing-nuts this month,  but he was
15,01promptly beaten and mugged by Kabal 13.  When told that Tempus was one of iCE's
15,01"oldschool" legends,  Kabal merely shrugged and  said that the bastard was part
15,01of the SSH conspiracy.

15,015.  In the "iCE criminal  of the month"  department,  Friar Tuck's ugly mug has
15,01been pinned up to the ice.org post office wall.  Tuck, whose car was demolished
15,01recently by a slightly  crazed woman  (Syntax would like  to add that this is a
15,01redundant  definition),  purchased a brand new  '97 black-on-black-on-black  VW
15,01Jetta,  and promptly received two tickets in his first day of driving it.   The
15,01first was a routine speeding ticket,  worth 4 points and quite a few bucks, and
15,01the second  was for  attempting  to bribe the  summons-issuing  officer  with a
15,01donut.   "It was my last Cruller,"  said Friar Tuck,  "you'd <expletive>  think
15,01that'd be worth something!"  The officer declined comment.

15,016.  iCE would like  to congratulate all of  the members who  graduated  college
15,01this past May.   We would also like to congratulate Syntax Error  and  Vesalius
15,01for  hitting their  'final  stretch' in their  medical  schooling,  and want to
15,01wish them luck on their way to writing the  rest of us prescriptions for Prozac
15,01and Lithium.

15,017.  Rumours were circulating the Cannes film festival in France saying that the
15,01new sexy actor of the year would be -- iCE's very own Magnetic M!   Starring in
15,01such new movies as "The Teddy Bear Murders" and "Revenge of the Slurp",  Maggie
15,01was the hit of the festival.   Several well-endowed (Syntax would  like to once
15,01again  point out that he's  available for plastic surgery  consultation)  women
15,01were seen hanging all over M.  Magnetic M refuses to confirm or deny the rumors
15,01but instead offers the following statement ":)~~~" whatever that means.

15,018.  THIS JUST IN: A protest  was staged by Kitiara, Anarchy,  and Sprite due to
15,01the misogynistic  and degrading  representations of women  attributed to Syntax
15,01in this NFO file.  New iCE guy Wired  also tried to join in,  but we just think
15,01he was trying to get some action.

15,019.  Another month of penguin  beating and  tribal chants  mixed into  a graphic
15,01display of 90's mentality.  Another wonderful pack.   You just can't understand
15,01what it's like to be iCE, unless you are.  See you next month!
