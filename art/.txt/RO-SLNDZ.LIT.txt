15,01Savage Landz

15,01He leaves His small house and enters the street,
15,01He feels satisfaction as He smells city air,
15,01Gives each of the highrises and buildings a greet,
15,01The concrete so sturdy, the neon so fair,
15,01He loves His city.

15,01Staggering down the street, a nervous grin on His lips,
15,01He knows what he needs and he knows what he'll get,
15,01No one offers any aid as he nearly falls and trips,
15,01Walks up to the dealer with his smiling face set,
15,01He belongs in His city.

15,01Driving down the road with no headlights on,
15,01The long sedan filled with men in black,
15,01He doesn't notice the danger His conscience is gone,
15,01With a needle in His arm He never looked back,
15,01He's addicted to His city.

15,01He slowly withdraws the needle from His skin,
15,01Now He feels like a god without a trace of fear,
15,01Poor man loves His city like He loves heroine,
15,01He never sensed a thing as the dark car drew near,
15,01He feels safe in His city.

15,01Didn't feel the impacts as he was shot in the street,
15,01He still smiled dully as he saw blood on his hands,
15,01Another gunshot blew him off of his feet,
15,01As he became another victim of the savage lands,
15,01He died in His city.
