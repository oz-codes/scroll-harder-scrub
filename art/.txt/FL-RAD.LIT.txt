15,01                   00Reality and deception go hand in hand
15,01                     00Continuing onward  like the sands
15,01                    00In an hour glass they flow smoothly
15,01                     00The deception  beneath fools thee
15,01                 00Look within yourself  and find what brews
15,01               00A cauldron of deception  and misguiding clues
15,01                       00Thus reality itself is warped
15,01                      00Your whole world seems to morph
15,01                   00Into something it isn't but yet still
15,01                  00The deception of reality that will fill
15,01                 00Your mind with  violence, chaos, and lust
15,01                     00Which you strongly  feel you must
15,01               00Release upon those who challenge your beliefs
15,01            00Causing their deceptions of  reality to be breeched
15,01                       00Thus they fill sad as you did
15,01                   00Continuing the chain  reaction within
15,01                     00The reality that we currently see
15,01                      00That will one  day destroy thee
