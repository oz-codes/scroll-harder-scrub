00,01Radiance


00,01She sleeps, it rests beside her;

00,01She wakes, it rises as well.

00,01She smiles, it gleams with brilliancy;

00,01She frowns, it is concealed to the day.

00,01Empyreal and Impressive

00,01With these she outlasts it;

00,01Luminous and Radiant,

00,01With these she outshines it.

00,01To touch her is to be warned,

00,01To see her is to be blinded,

00,01But to hold her is to fade away like summer dreams.

00,01For she is the one more radiant than the sun.
