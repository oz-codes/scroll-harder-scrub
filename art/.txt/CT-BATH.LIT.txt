15,01I stand, gangly, in front of the tub.
15,01The shower's not working.
15,01In fact, none of the plumbing is really working properly.

15,01A garden hose nozzle sticks out of the wall like an alcoholic garden snake 
15,01who can't keep his liquor.

15,01I look down into the tub, then across into the mirror.
15,01Back to the tub.

15,01There's no way in Hell that I'm going to fit in there.

15,01Still, I manage somehow.  I do my best to huddle in the far corner (in 
15,01reality somewhat over a half) of the basin while water spurts out at a right 
15,01angle from the wall and slowly comes to a descent plumb between my legs.

15,01Good Lord, what a cheeky faucet.  Hope the old one gets fixed soon.

15,01I turn off the perpendicular flow when the tub is approximately halfway 
15,01full.  Then, I unfold.

15,01The whole process takes several minutes and it is with the greatest of 
15,01temptations that I avoid making "Transformers" sound effects.  Finally, I am 
15,01spent, filling the tub as best I am able.

15,01I sit still.  The water is fluid, appropriately enough, and so I wait for it
15,01to settle considerably before daring to take a breath.

15,01Inhale.  The water creeps over my belly and chest, lapping and tickling at 
15,01my chin as a wave of smells rides over the oncoming tide.

15,01I don't care what Gilette tells me, but there's nothing really indecent 
15,01about the mixture of incense and sandalwood which hits me between the eyes 
15,01(and a little bit down.)  It smells like a sauna - of sweat, certainly, but 
15,01the sweat of existance - not the cold, clingy perspiration of apathy nor the 
15,01sticky, drenching syrup of backbreaking work - appropriate enough as work is 
15,01something which I seem to be diametrically opposed from.

15,01Satisfied with this lungful, I exhale.  Waves receed.  Belly is once more 
15,01exposed, like a beached whale of uncommon hairiness.  Eddies twirl and 
15,01ripple before coming unexpectedly back at me, momentarily covering my mouth 
15,01and nose before passing behind my head and over the top of the tub.

15,01Oops.  

15,01Then the blur of froth and lather arrives.  Soap, shampoo - remove the oils 
15,01which my body has invested so much time in secreting and replace them with, 
15,01well, lemons and carolina pine forests.  I no longer have smells but 
15,01fragrances - am no longer but an animal - now I am a man, perfumed and 
15,01civilized, ready to take on sentience with a thinking brain and an aroma of 
15,01april meadows!

15,01This irritates me immensely upon consideration, but the washing ritual has 
15,01managed to keep me relatively free of parasites and infection, so it is a 
15,01double-bladed sword.

15,01Canny to my unintentional tsunami, I further drain one half of the remaining 
15,01water from the tub, then attempt to submerge my head.  Well, up to the ears.
15,01There.  Knock the bubbles of air trapped within out of either side and listen
15,01carefully.

15,01The ocean!  It's travelled well through clouds and streams to emerge through 
15,01the gaping mouth of a homely garden hose and once more roar in my face.

15,01Emerging from the white basin, I shake a few clinging droplets from my outer 
15,01layre of insulation and wipe myself down, though I think the action is taken 
15,01more for the tactile sensation than to accomplish a drying action - not THAT 
15,01much water is retained on the surface.  What, am I a sponge?

15,01(Looking at my fingers momentarily later - yes, Rowan, you are a sponge.  
15,01That, or a prune.) 

15,01Am I clean?  Yes.  Cleaner than I was before?  Well... let's rephrase that.
15,01Am I sterile?  Certainly.  Nothing oozes or scuttles beneath my eyes, so the 
15,01bath must have not been without reason.  Do I pass the smell-check?

15,01Sniff.  Sniff.

15,01Egad.  It'll take me days and days of hard, tedious existance to regain what
15,01I had before.  Why am i so persistant in getting rid of it every few days?
