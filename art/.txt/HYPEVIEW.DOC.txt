15,01iCE HyperView 1.0b: Notes, etc..
15,01 
15,01 - With the advent of such AWESOME original art in higher resolution modes,
15,01   many conflicts become apparent.  Considering the lack of standards over
15,01   higher resolution modes, iCE has decided to code a viewing engine that
15,01   allows all PC users to fully enjoy high resolution art...

15,01 - The simple, but fast and effective routine was written by Renegade Bit-
15,01   Head, who intended users to be able to scroll through the picture with
15,01   the use of the numeric keypad or arrow controls.  Basically, the engine
15,01   is in a very "bare bone" stage, and plans are slated to conistently
15,01   improve the engine to contain:
15,01    
15,01   - A simplified user interface...
15,01   - MOD / STM Support...
15,01   - Optional text scroller support...
15,01   - Automated pathing routines...

15,01 - To use the utility, basically all that is needed is a computer above the 
15,01   8086 level.  Typing in the executable filename will bring up the art 
15,01   in a 320 x 240 VGA tweaked square VGA mode that is consistent with proper
15,01   pixel shapes.  The arrow keys will move the picture in the specified    
15,01   direction and the '5' key on the pad will halt the current movement. Esc,
15,01   of course, exits the routine.
