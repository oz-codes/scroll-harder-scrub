15,01Amish people have always amused me.  They are content to use machines, such as
15,01wagons and peppermills, so long as they are primitive machines.  As soon as
15,01machines reach a certain technological level, they refuse to touch them.

15,01If god taught man how to make a wheel, then why not a Pentium?

15,01Not that I believe in god, I just enjoy shooting holes in other people's
15,01beliefs...

15,01I like computers.  I like telephones, lights, CD players and airplanes.

15,01But...

15,01There is something very soothing and comforting about stripping yourself of all
15,01unnatural things (even down to wearing cotton clothes) and venturing far into
15,01the woods.  Finding a nice rock, which millions of years of tumbling and
15,01erosion have worn into a comfortable shape just for me, and imbibing on the
15,01solitude and peace.  The green and brown life, the sweet smell of clean air.
15,01Not a single sound to be heard, save for the odd singing bird, or falling leaf,
15,01or twinkling creek.

15,01Even better than that, although this is merely personal preference, is the same
15,01scene in the rain.  The cool, clean drops of water melodically falling on your
15,01body... the soft hiss as they strike the leaves in the treetops above... and
15,01the wonderful smell of rejuvenated earth.

15,01No artificial intelligence will ever take that from me.  Nature has seduced me,
15,01never to let me go.
