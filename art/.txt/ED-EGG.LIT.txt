00,01Late at night all dressed in black,
00,01Get the shet and start to attack,
00,01Riding around wif the windows rolled down,
00,01Hoping fences, rolling on the ground,
00,01Sliding through the woods,
00,01Walking through da hoods,
00,01Prepare to launch and attack,
00,01Wake up with egg on yer back,
00,01Dripping down, staining the window,
00,01Running away, but keeping low,
00,01Always on the move,
00,01Always keeping smooth,
00,01Run, run, run away,
00,01Fun no more, no more play,
00,01Old guy chasing you,
00,01First ya were fast, first you flew,
00,01Now you slowed, he's almost catching up,
00,01Reaching out, triying to pick up,
00,01You dive in a car and take off,
00,01Laughing and cackling and the old dude..
00,01(Hah, you thought that would rhyme?!?! Hah!)
