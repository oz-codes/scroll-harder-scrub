00,01  Yesterday I smelled some flowers...they drove me, quite insane
00,01  I pondered their fragile beauty... finding it, quite inane.
00,01  The flowers spoke to me in riddles, teasing my nervous brain
00,01  The flowers taunted me with insults, increasing my endless pain

15,01                 00Why must my mood's swing so?
15,01                 00switching now from hi to low.
15,01                 00Moments of ticklish gladness
15,01                 00Moments of tormenting sadness

15,01                 00Why must my mood's change so?
15,01                 00I would surely like to know
15,01                 00Constant confusion and dillusion
15,01                 00Life as I know all illusion.

00,01 Today I entered life's embrace, twisted smile upon my face.
00,01 I see people's eyes and wonder, frightened at a dizzy pace.
00,01 What do they want of me? why cant the just let me be...
00,01 What did I ever do to them, that they might, bother me....

15,01                 00Why must my mood swing so?
15,01                 00Changing now from high to low...
15,01                 00Increasing mental paranoia
15,01                 00Decreasing healthy mental flow...

15,01                 00Why must my mood change so?
15,01                 00So happy just a sec ago...
15,01                 00Now will you tell me...Why?
15,01                 00Why I should not let me go?

00,01 Thoughts of suicide pervade me...all the while I don't know why
00,01 Thinking that you all might hate me...wishing me to slowly die
00,01 The doctors now wont even see me, they all think I dont exist
00,01 There is nothing more now for me...cautiously I slit my wrist

15,01                 00Why must my mood swing so?
15,01                 00My life's blood begins to flow
15,01                 00Mirror seems to fade slowly...
15,01                 00DO i really want to go?

15,01                 00Why must my mood shift so?
15,01                 00Now I think I finally know...
15,01                 00Life is just a two-way mirror
15,01                 00I Didn't really want to go.
