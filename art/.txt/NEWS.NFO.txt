14,01Pondering the real meaning of Rice Krispie Square

14,01        Rice Krispie squares aren't really squares.  They are cubes.  Cubes 
14,01formed of elliptical grains of puffed rice.  Straight edges fashioned from 
14,01many curved ones.

14,01        But there is more.  If the simple reaction of Rice Krispie plus 
14,01marshmallow called Rice Krispie Squares results in a cube, the creation of a 
14,01Rice Krispie Cube would have as its final result a Rice Krispie Tesseract, a 
14,01construct capable of holding an entire cowful of milk and still floating on 
14,01top and retaining its crunchiness.

14,01        What would be the product of the attempted creation of a Rice 
14,01Krispie Hypercube?  We're not sure, but we think that they resemble 
14,01inside-out pretzels.

15,01        ...

15,01        What the HELL happened to 00FOS15?!  Believe it or not, there's been a lot
15,01of people asking me that.  Yes, a lot of people have actually heard of FOS,
15,01and since we haven't released since last summer, it's understandable to think
15,01that we died.

15,01        We didn't die, dammit.

15,01        After some discussion among the members after our July `96 pack, we
15,01agreed to take some time off...there wasn't enough art assembled for a full
15,01release in September, so we opted for October.  Then the deadline kept changing
15,01and changing some more.  Then things went down the toilet.  Side projects began
15,01to take priority.  Hard drives crashed.  People moved, ran away, etc.  All of a
15,01sudden, most of the members were unaccounted for!  Thankfully, 00Cthulu15 reminded
15,01me of the planned dual-release (this pack) that we had talked about before.  I
15,01fired up my trusty Pine e-mail and sent out mail to the FOS mailing list for 
15,01the first time in ages.  Believe it or not, several faithful members replied!
15,01So between some old art I had originally collected for last October and a LOT
15,01of new material from the 00VGA division15, FOS has awakened.  Here's the lowdown
15,01on members and sites:

15,01        14City of Shadows15 is down, as is every other artboard in 612.  00Royal15 
00,01Assassin15 is moving, and the board is history.  Myself, Royal and 00RBX15 are the
15,01only remaining active artists on our native soil (although Royal is basically
15,01a full-time parent now)...14White Noise15 and 14Brimborion15 have apparently cooked up
15,01a zesty anti-matter recipe which they mistakenly taste-tested.  14Phyn15 is missing
15,01in action...I called his house, and his parents thought maybe 00*I*15 knew of his
15,01whereabouts!  Nope.  14Radjan15 vanished without a trace, although I ran into him
15,01on a local WWIV board.  He hasn't returned my mail.  Finally, 14Estatic15 leaves us
15,01after a long time with the group.  He came with me to 14ACiD!ANSi15 and like me left
15,01with the departure of 00Cool T15.  He will remain in 00CiA15, so best of luck to him.
15,01Amazingly, we did pick up a new ascii artist, 00Silence15.

15,01        There wasn't any other site news.  We will publish an updated site list
15,01in the next pack.  The WWW page (00www.warped.com/~kwagner15) will serve as our HQ
15,01until everything is sorted out.  It's looking VERY nice, thanks to the efforts
15,01of 00Sector Slayer15.  Watch for art from the whole FOS crew on there.

15,01        Next pack???  Yes.  00March15 will mark the second year of FOS, so there
15,01WILL be a pack.  Be warned, our ansi team is back to where it started.  Yeah,
15,01I was the only ansi artist when FOS began in `95, simply because we only needed
15,01an ansi artist to handle BBS art for member boards.  00Gree15 has primarily switched
15,01to hirez, and 00Wolverine15 is simply not as involved in the scene as he once was.
15,01Alas, I draw ansi for 00Acid15 now, so even I will be joining the VGA bandwagon.
15,01As many people have noted of late, ascii and hirez are the most called-for
15,01mediums...ansi is for the enjoyment of other artists and the loyal BBSers, but
