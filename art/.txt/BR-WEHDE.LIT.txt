15,01We Hide

15,01I just couldn't walk away
15,01Tried too hard to understand
15,01I couldn't find the words to say
15,01I just didn't have a plan
15,01Just want to let you see
15,01All the things you've done to me
15,01Tried hard to pull through
15,01Why did I waste all this time just for you
15,01Maybe I loved you more than you knew
15,01I couldn't cry on your shoulder
15,01The way I wanted to 
15,01Wanted to hold your hand 
15,01To fill my void inside
15,01I didn't believe that pain
15,01Is something that we hide
