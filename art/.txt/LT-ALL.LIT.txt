15,01      00It all depends on us all....

00,01 Just when you think, you've seen it all
00,01we're left mummified by yet more senselessness
00,01 Reluctant to question all that they say
00,01are they ever satisfied or must they have it all

00,01 Why must you be so malicious when it doesn't change a thing
00,01why be so disconcerted walking your path of despair
00,01 You've got to give thanks for what you already have
00,01why can't you see that change, it depends on us all

00,01 Can't you see the change, it depends on us all
00,01we've got to speak out, it depends on us all
00,01 We've got remember, it depends on us all

00,01a visionary I may be but not just a dreamer
00,01 I'm searching for utopia but just some sanity
