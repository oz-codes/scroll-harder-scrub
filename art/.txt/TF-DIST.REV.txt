15,01Distorted Reality 
15,01 
15,01Viewing the darkness, nothing to percieve.
15,01A moving stillness that we are unable to believe.
15,01Obscurity fading in, illumination fading out.
15,01The intensity it once had, has taken another route.
15,01Self-sacrificing it's own immortality,
15,01Facing life like a reality.
15,01Letting death have a fair chance,
15,01Becoming deluged by it's deadly dance.
15,01It is so altered, we cannot clearly see.
15,01It is, was, and will always be. An omitted section.
15,01A Distorted Reality.
