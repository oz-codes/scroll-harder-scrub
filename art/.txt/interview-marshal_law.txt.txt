15,01iCE: for starters, please tell us about yourself.  first name, age,
15,01     occupation, hobbies

15,01Marshal Law: Darron, 31, Code jockey (massive oversimplification) for a
15,01             Financial Services Firm.  If I had some time, I might get some
15,01             hobbies.  I make it to the gym regularly but I don't know if
15,01             that qualifies.  I just finished a season of summer league
15,01             lacrosse.  I do some recreational coding in my spare time and
15,01             I enjoy the occasional romp on the PS2.  I recently finished
15,01             the new Tom Clancey novel on the daily commute and I can still
15,01             be found sketching on those days when I am more right-brain
15,01             dominant.
15,01 
15,01iCE: cool. where were you born?  still live there?

15,01Marshal Law: New Jersey.  Still a resident of the Garden State.
15,01 
15,01iCE: How and when did you join iCE?

15,01Marshal Law: The iCE archives may have a better idea of exactly when, it
15,01             was a while ago.  If I remember correctly, the first time I
15,01             became a member of iCE was because the group I was in merged
15,01             with iCE.  It was a pretty competitive time with respect to 
15,01             ansi groups and they provided greater exposure than an
15,01             individual could attain by themselves. Of course in the
15,01             beginning, and in the end, I was never really in it for the
15,01             notoriety but rather because it was something that I enjoyed
15,01             doing.  The scene provided me with access to a great group of
15,01             individuals from all around the country.
15,01 
15,01iCE: What other ANSi groups have you participated in?  Which one was your
15,01     first?

15,01Marshal Law: If I remember correctly, they were iCE, ACiD and RPM.  If I
15,01             can find my archive of work, I could probably answer that
15,01             question more accurately.
15,01 
15,01iCE: Force Ten will be mad if you forget about GRiM.

15,01Marshal Law: Oops. and GRiM. I was a part of a number of groups, some more
15,01             than once.  There was really no rhyme or reason to it.  A lot
15,01             of the time it really just had to do with who I had more
15,01             contact with at the time.
15,01 
15,01iCE: hehe. Which one was first?  RPM?  I don't think i've seen any RPM
15,01     packs, if you can dig them up that would be awesome.  Were you in ACiD
15,01     before or after iCE?  Did you release with them?

15,01Marshal Law: The chronology is really hazy but I think it went iCE ACiD iCE
15,01             again.  If I find the files on the old PC then I could answer
15,01             these questions better.  I think I killed off some of the brain
15,01             cells that I needed for this conversation in college a few years
15,01             ago.
15,01 
15,01iCE: hehe.  Any files you can dig up would be awesome additions for the iCE
15,01     archives.

15,01[note: ML's old PC, and all the ansi goodness contained within, is gone
15,01       forever.]
15,01 
15,01iCE: So, what first got you interested in ANSi art?

15,01Marshal Law: I think it was all the chicks that the guys got.  Just kidding.
