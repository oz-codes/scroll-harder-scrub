15,011.  Welcome to the iCE Physical Therapy Ward!   On your left -  the man we know
15,01as Doctor SlipperyFinger, Force Ten!   He's not the one with the Frito-flavored
15,01nipple clasps, but you can see the top of his head over that large man we found
15,01on the street  pawning dollar  bills.   Next to him you  can see Mass Delusion,
15,01teaching those small naked children Spanish  and holding up that one to get the
15,01funnel from the nice woman baking pies.  Boy!  I hope that plastic tube doesn't
15,01catch the hook holding up the suspension-harness, or that old woman is going to
15,01get some SERIOUS rug-burn!

15,012.  Doodlebug, our PR  Spokeperson and  star of Cleopatra Jones,  was seriously
15,01wounded during the mad rush when the tour  bus unloaded the new members of iCE.
15,01In order of the number of testicular  nodules, here is the new crew that can be
15,01seen walking the cramped  halls of our office  space:  The Knave - an old  ACiD
15,01fellow, attended his first iCE Sleep-over,  and held the candle with the lights
15,01out and told us  all about his childhood  fears.  Needless  to say, we all felt
15,01the same  way  about the  Kool-Aid Man(tm),  so  he was  admitted  immediately.
15,01Shoten, an energetic vga artist,  told us of his love for fresh packing tape on
15,01his "nether regions",  and was unanimously  welcomed.   Mads Vester, a friendly
15,01Dane,  felt funny  around dogs -  resulting in  a fantastic  welcome!   Nosegos
15,01showed  us his embarassing  birthmark and the fun just didn't stop there, so he
15,01was quickly brought into the fold.

15,013.  Trauma and iCE have parted ways,  sadly rather  unpleasantly.   Trauma will
15,01most likely  never be  returning  to  iCE,  but we  wish him  well in  all  his
15,01endeavors and sexual conquests.

15,014.  Inazone, along with his sock  puppet Guido, will be taking over for Kadaver
15,01and Count Zer0  as the new  ansi coordinator.   He told us to let everyone know
15,01that he has a  shiny new bike  and rides it every day and his mom said they can
15,01take the training wheels off next week if he's good.  But he refuses to eat the
15,01broccoli, and  complains that  it's not fair  that he  has to  ride a bike with
15,01training wheels at age 22.  She told him to go to his room.

15,015.  Vesalius, now a full doctor with a family and a serious love for turds, has
15,01just become too busy to keep up his zany,  crazy job of VGA Coordinator.  While
15,01we were sulking over who to choose  as the new VGA head, Roland came around the
15,01corner  holding aloft his  brand new  AK-47 with a  crowd  of angry  FBI agents
15,01directly behind him.   As a result,  Roland is the new VGA Head.  His first act
15,01was to declare  himself VGA  Coordinator  For Life  (VCFL),  so we expect to be
15,01working with him for quite some time in the future.

15,016.  Slothy, that assy Lord Soth turd, is now Senior Staff again.  Bad move, but
15,01everyone's entitled  to their mistakes.   Word on the street  is that Slothy is
15,01already plotting to collect  a tax on  childbirth in order  to finally purchase
15,01his very own Oscar Meyer food plant.  Grand plans - let's see what comes of it.

15,017.  We hope you enjoy this pack!  The ansi team all came out this month to take
15,01part in the grand party we had.  We put on our skimpiest clothes and showed off
15,01what we got and shook  it all around the  dance floor, and we  think you'll dig
15,01our swinging shimmy - we know that Sinned Soul of ACiD sure does.

15,01                                                        - Lord Soth
