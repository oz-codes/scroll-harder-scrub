15,01.Harvest Moon.

15,01The night falls on the quiet plains;
15,01No more sorrow; no more pains.
15,01For all is tranquil; all at peace,    
15,01And every evil's work shall cease.
15,01Now darkness beaten by the light;
15,01The moon shines, holy beams, so bright.

15,01But this reign of good lasts so long,
15,01Until she completes her nightly song.
15,01The song she sings tells a sweet tale,
15,01Of her love with the sun; the male.
15,01And that she would never meet with him. 
15,01For they, were set apart; the dark's whim.

15,01She hated the dark, with all of her heart;
15,01A forced relationship; she strived to part.
15,01So every night, she shines her most,
15,01And breaks right through the darkened ghost.
15,01Her light preserves the land, about to die;
15,01As she holds her position high in the sky.
