15,01      .-----------------.

15,01Black Maiden was founded some 8 years ago by VOiCE. It was about to
15,01establish itself a name in the CPC cracker scene. The only members then
15,01were VOiCE and TEX. The cracking went on for some years but its range
15,01was only local. Then, with the aid of LOrD HeAleR, as he is now known,
15,01we went over to programming - still on the CPC, as nobody spoke about
15,01IBM personal computers, or at least not concerning games and the like.
15,01We worked hard on a role playing game for about 2 years. In terms of
15,01graphic it greatly outreached what had been done, or better neglected,
15,01on the CPC till then. Unfortunately it had never been finished, as we
15,01went over to the PC finally, afer having made a side leap to the AMiGA.
15,01This one being of no greater importance, as we only started converting
15,01our game for that machine, but gave up quite early.
15,01So then, we were nested on the PC. Personally, I started planning on a
15,01new game, but lost my motives as I could not withstand the concurrence
15,01with my programming knowledges. In the meantime, Black Maiden was
15,01reinforced by 2 new members, in order to publish a magazine, and a bit
15,01later, LOrD HeAleR definately belonged to us, too. We are still
15,01publishing this magazine, which is based on critics on satires of our
15,01modern society, and proves to be a good way to pass on our literary
15,01and poetic creations to the 'public'.
15,01Time went by, and with the appearances of the first modems (in our
15,01ranks, not in general :) we began meddling with the art scence in the
15,01net-world. We then decided to transform Black Maiden from simple authors
15,01into an ARt-group (no, no mistake in the spelling, I like writing ARt
15,01like that :).
15,01So now we are proud to present to you the fruits of our hard work, the
15,01first pack from the new Luxembourg ARt-group: BL+\CK M+\iDEN !
15,01Enjoy, and don't forget: If you are skilled in some of the things we do,
15,01there's no reason why you should not become a member. Just fill out the
15,01accompanying application sheet. If you have any suggestions, critics or
15,01whatever, don't hesitate to call one of our boards (see listing for

15,01Now, really, have a look!
