00,01The Chosen

00,01Lead me to the land of wonders
00,01Allow me to fortify my boundaries
00,01Beckon me for now
00,01For I shall be the chosen
00,01Traveling on an endless journey
00,01Seems to me, quite uninhabitated
00,01Destroy me with your words no more
00,01For I know I"m the chosen
00,01Deliver yourself from the evils within
00,01Come and sell your soul
00,01Be admonished of your sins
00,01For I've become the chosen
