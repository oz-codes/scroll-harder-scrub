15,01                We have a few artists pending, and with their addition,
15,01        ALiVE's quality will increase dramatically, upping our chances as
15,01        the number 1 small group for 94.  (small means we don't have lots of
15,01        acid/ice members. =)

15,01                Information on new sites - don't bet on it.  Additional
15,01        alive sites will be by invite only or made from past applications.

15,01        enthused about the surging support, however we are about full.
15,01        Sorry guys, gotta cut off somewhere!

15,01        Just new shit for 5/94!

15,01                Well, we didn't have any exciting encounters with acid
15,01        members, we didn't get to base jump the empire states building, and
15,01        we have been water skiing yet in 35 degree shasta lake.  However,
15,01        some SERIOUS shit went down in 5/94 and we think we oughta cover it.
