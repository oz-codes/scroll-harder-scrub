15,01                                      [i]

15,01                      There lies a land, locked by my mind
15,01                         Of which I often seek to find
15,01                       The heaven there, is one of peace
15,01                    Where raging wars once fought, now cease
15,01                        And rivalries, of creed and race
15,01                        Are now unknown upon it's face.

15,01                                      [ii]

15,01                         Waking from the dream, I feel
15,01                       I can't distinguish fake from real
15,01                        And bright as heaven seems to be
15,01                           There must remain reality
15,01                       That horrid truth, it must pervade
15,01                         Sharp, unfeeling, as a blade.

15,01                                     [iii]

15,01                       And in my once pure flawless world
15,01                        A living fire, Hate has unfurled
15,01                      Their names, his Sons then do recite
15,01                      Are "Murder, Chaos, War, and Night"
15,01                    Then Murder speaks, with booming voice:
15,01                      "In kiss of death, I shall rejoice!"
15,01                       Next Chaos reigns, and rises vow:
15,01                    "Your priceless world, lies ruins now!"
15,01                       War steps up, and takes his turn:
15,01                     "Your soul will be engulfed and burn!"
15,01                       You cannot see, as Night propels:
15,01                         "May you live in many hells!"
15,01                     And all the while, the Hate does grin
15,01                          As his children die within.

15,01                                      [iv]

15,01                         Above and about, I'm on my way
15,01                      Past the snowcapped mountains today
15,01                       With new rebirth, I live in light
15,01                        Safe from Murder, War, and Night
15,01                     But Chaos lives, and follows this day
15,01                      A few steps behind, a few feet away
15,01                       I cannot see him, but he is there
15,01                        A minor flaw in my day, so fair.

15,01                                      [v]

15,01                       One night, I forsee, he will arise
15,01                         To inevitably bring my demise
15,01                         I will prepare, for that event
15,01                      But now, his meagre life looks spent
15,01                        But soon he will, repay his debt
15,01                        To me, and Hate, my only threat.

15,01                                      [vi]

15,01                    Next day, yet months, within my thought
15,01                          In this land I often sought
15,01                      And with these arms, I bear tonight
15,01                       Chaos, and forbidden Hate, I fight
15,01                        Not with a crimson blade of rust
15,01                        But with my mystic mind I trust
15,01                      To slay these fiends, and put to end
15,01                        The damage taken years to mend.

15,01                                     [vii]

15,01                        The fight lasts long, eternally
15,01                     Chaos is cast to the depths; set free
15,01                     And though our fervent paths may cross
15,01                         My life will always be a loss
15,01                       I spend my withered days in wander
15,01                  And mourn for a time, and sometimes ponder.

15,01                                     [viii]

15,01                      In coming spring, my thoughts renew
