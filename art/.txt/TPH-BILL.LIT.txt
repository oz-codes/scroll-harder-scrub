15,01              00"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
15,01              00men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
15,01              00Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among
15,01              00these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness;
15,01              00and that to secure these rights, Governments are
15,01              00instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from
15,01              00the consent of the governed.  That whenever any Form of
15,01              00government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the
15,01              00RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO ALTER OR ABOLISH IT."
