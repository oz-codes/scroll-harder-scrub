15,01demons lair

15,01the heart of men holds the evil that they do
15,01the hatred of the centuries fill your heart
15,01using it to find a place to call your own personal hell
15,01there is already hell on earth, this is not what you seek
15,01you need to be with the true evil ones, the ones that put the evil in 
15,01your heart, and the hearts of man kind
15,01they have, and hold the power you seek to share with them
15,01at night your dreams are burning these horrid images in your mind
15,01images of a land were the dead go to be tormented for all eternity
15,01all the more wanting to join them in the
15,01demons lair...
