15,01lost in sorrow, crying in pain,
15,01my tears roll donw, like acid rain.
15,01why did I let her fuck with my emotions,
15,01why couldn't I see she has no devotions?
15,01that little fucking preppie, that little fucking whore,
15,01now she's out wiht her boyfriend, begging him for more.
15,01I was floating in her loving sea,
15,01she killed my love, and burned it wiht me.
