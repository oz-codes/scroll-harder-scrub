15,01Today is the worst day..
15,01The very worst day..
15,01To have a birthday..
15,01Why do they call it a Birthday?
15,01When for some, its a day of dying..
15,01Of coming closer to death..
15,01For others, its another year down the drain..
15,01Only for the fools is it a day of celebration..
15,01A day when they can forget the fact that they are but one year 
15,01closer to the day in which they die..
15,01The day..
15,01Day is a meager word.. 
15,01A Set of hours would be better..
15,01The hours we count untill we cannot count any more..
15,01The minutes we pass as life passes us..
15,01A Missed chance at that job..
15,01A Missed chance at that lay..
15,01We seem to be a bad aim,
15,01Missing more than we could ever hit..
15,01Or are we just setting our hopes too high?
15,01That could be quite possible..
15,01Allways hoping, never working..
15,01Never working, allways dreaming..
15,01Dreaming for that love,
15,01Dreaming for that money,
15,01Dreaming for that life the other person seems to enjoy so much..
15,01Window shopping for souls..
15,01Can I buy your's while we're at it?
15,01You seem to like it so much..
15,01Take a turn down the road of insanity,
15,01Try mine out for a while..
15,01I'll Be your chauffuer,
15,01You be the boss..
15,01But hey, its all a dream anyways right?
15,01It cannot be that real?
15,01Hmm, look into my eyes, and answer yourself..
15,01Take a deep, long look, gaze farther in..
15,01In untill I grab your spirit,
15,01And rip it out of your body,
15,01Make it mine..
15,01I want your oh-so-happy life,
15,01And you want my dark dream..
15,01We can make a deal, even trade..
15,01Come closer feeble one..
15,01Let me have that beautiful gift of love,
15,01That gift of beauty.. 
15,01Bring it closer..
15,01I want it now..
15,01Heh, you thought it would be so easy..
15,01So easy to blow me off,
15,01To put me on a shelf..
15,01To think me into non-existance..
15,01To lock me away for life..
15,01But I'm there..
15,01In the very deepest depths of your mind..
15,01I'm there..
15,01You cannot lock me away forever..
15,01I cannot be forgotten..
15,01I will resurface..
15,01Maybe not the same body,
15,01Maybe not the same name..
15,01But I am here, lurking in your duaghters, your sons..
15,01Ahh, that scares you eh?
15,01Makes you feel feeble eh?
15,01Maybe you just now glimpse reality?
15,01Maybe you dont like it.
15,01But its the only world I know..
15,01I may not love it, I may even hate it..
15,01But it is mine..
15,01And what is mine i protect.. 
15,01I hide it from you forever..
15,01Make it certain that you will never steal my cherished gift..
15,01But I am a buisnessman,
15,01I like to do deals..
15,01Wanna make a deal?
