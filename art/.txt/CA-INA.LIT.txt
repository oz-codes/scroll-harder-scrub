15,01Hello again
15,01My bad friend
15,01You've been listening to me
15,01Too much again
15,01                                                  I'm sure that what you feel
15,01                                                  Is nothing more than a phase
15,01                                                  You'll get over it
15,01                                                  And be one of us...
15,01                         Don't speak
15,01                         Don't say a word
15,01                         Just listen
15,01                              Please
15,01                         What you felt before
15,01                         You can feel again
15,01mostly I don't make sense, I ramble on in run-on sentences not stopping for a
15,01breath, I don't let you say a word, you can't reply back to me because I won't
15,01hear you because I'm still talking in one big run-on sentence that won't stop
15,01because if I have to stop then I'll have to think, and thinking is bad thinking
15,01makes you remember things, and remembering things is bad because you never
15,01remember the good times you only remember the bad things and bad things are
15,01evil because no one believes you and you just feel stupid because you're still
15,01talking in one big run-on sentence because you don't want people to understand
15,01what you're talking about because you don't want to people to understand what
15,01you're talking about because they'll then say things like "I understand what
15,01you are saying, you are not alone" or "I'm here to help you.. just tell me what
15,01bothering you. I understand" you can't understand because I'm talking in one
15,01big run-on sentence and I'm trying to numb your mind so that you can't
15,01understand what I'm saying and then you'll go away because you'll be too tired
15,01to listen to what I'm saying even though what I'm saying is really important
15,01but no one listens because I just talk in one big run-on sentence no letting
15,01anyone else speak or think or anything I just don't want them to understand I
15,01just want to be left alone and it's just all too much for me to understand so
15,01I'm not going to think about it I'll just continue talking in this one big
15,01run-on sentence that will never stop until I die and it'll probably still go on
15,01for ever because a lot of people do understand what I'm talking about I just
15,01don't care, I'm the most important person in my life, why should I care about
15,01anyone else, I'm not going to give those people enough time to speak I'm just
15,01going to keep going with run-on sentence because it now fills you're entire
15,01screen, and if you understand what I'm saying I'd enjoy a reply, touch me, feel
15,01me... participate with me... that was my pause string I wonder if anyone takes
15,01it to heart, is anyone listening, no, of course you're not listening this
15,01message is so long, it's just one big run-on sentence and it makes no sense to
15,01most people who are reading it, most people will see a screen full of text like
15,01this and say "this doesn't belong in this message base, this message base is
15,01for poems." well this is a poem, to me it's a poem, it lets me spew out all my
15,01fucken thoughts and no one will listen to it because most people don't have the
15,01patience to read it all, it's a lot of garbage right? line noise, it's all
15,01random line noise, and it won't stop until I die, or until the world has ended,
15,01even after the world ends, god will continue with this one big run-on sentence
15,01because god feels pain too, he's not perfect, if he was perfect he wouldn't be
15,01a guy, because as we all know, men are evil, we are the root of all destruction
15,01on the earth, and no matter how much we try to be nice we're always going to be
15,01considered rapists or murderers or government officials or people who just
15,01don't give a shit, I'm not saying that woment don't have it bad, women have a
15,01terrible time in this world too, but you can't generalize about people like
15,01that, some men really are nice and some women are very evil, or vice versa, it
15,01all just doesn't make any sense and it won't end until I die

15,01listen to it all
15,01     and let it stop your thoughts for a short time
15,01          then, finish it.
15,01               it's a big run-on sentence that is supposed to never end
15,01                    everyone feels some kind of pain
15,01                         add it to my run-on sentence
15,01                              I will definetely read it all

15,01                                   I won't say "I understand"
15,01                              I will try not to judge
15,01                         but people need to spew out all this junk
15,01                    every once in a while
15,01               just so we can get on with our lives
15,01          emotion is the cruelist joke that god played on us
15,01     someones got to listen
15,01but it's never him
15,01                                                            I am, Candide
