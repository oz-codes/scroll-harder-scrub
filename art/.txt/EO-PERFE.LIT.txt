15,01        "You have much to learn, Krethay. Press the device and stop your
15,01disobedience," said Grak, coldly. Katherine had no choice, and did.
15,01Katherine Sonso's foster family was not normal. The young teenager told them so
15,01        As the blue sparkles engulfed her, forcing her into a new, excitingould
15,01future, Katherine heard Zeeka grumble, "I'll be happy when she learns Takalish
15,01so we can stop speaking this twisted English."

15,01                                THE END" asked Mrs. Sonso calmly. She was used

15,01        "I want a family that is exciting! Exotic! A family that can provide a
15,01wonderfully full and exciting teenagehood for me! I am so bored and it's all
15,01your fault!" She took a deep breath and prepared for the finale. "I want a
15,01life! I want adventure! I want my REAL family!" With that, Katherine tossed her
15,01thin brown hair over her shoulder (which was her favorite
15,01teenage-girl-and-proud-of-it gesture) and stormed outside, slamming the door
15,01behind her.

15,01        "Where is that daughter of ours going?" asked Mr. Sonso. He, like his
15,01wife, had blonde hair and blue eyes, and dressed quite conservatively.

15,01        "I'm sure she'll be back soon," said Mrs. Sonso, going upstairs to fix
15,01cute little sandwichs with toothpicks in them for her husband.

15,01        Katherine walked around the elementary school, which was deserted
15,01because of the simple fact that it was summer vacation. She sat on a bench for
15,01a while and brooded about how boring her life was. "I have a boring family,"
15,01she told a chickadee that was hopping along looking for small pieces of bread.
15,01It didn't seem to care about what she was saying, but she went on anyways.

15,01        "My life is boring too. I have boring straight hair. I have boring
15,01brown eyes. Not sprakling brown eyes or bouyant well-conditioned auburn hair.
15,01Just boring, plain, simple.....I want DYNAMICS! I want people to notice me!"

15,01        The chickadee looked at her some more and hopped a bit farther away.
15,01She ignored this silent insult and went on. "My clothes are boring. My parents
15,01refuse to buy any exciting clothes for me. My real parents would care! They'd
15,01buy me cool clothes and take me to Europe and let me surf in Hawaii on the
15,01weekends!"

15,01        The chickadee was now completely uninterested (as opposed to mildly
15,01interested that she might have a bit of bread stashed somewhere) and hopped
15,01away rather fast. It must have feared that she was going to follow it, for soon 

15,01after building up quite a good hopping speed, it thrust itself into the wind
15,01and, with a flap of tiny wings, was gone.

15,01        Katherine frowned. Stupid twit of a bird. Since there was no longer an
15,01audience for her to burden with her greivances, she decided to go home. Maybe
15,01her brother (fake-foster-brother, she reminded herself sternly) would be there,
15,01and she could nag him until he called her a few names. Then she could accuse
15,01him of being cruel to her because she was adopted, and start up a nasty fuss
15,01about the whole thing, with the end result of a new dress for her (to assure
15,01her that even though she was adopted, she was still loved) and a grounding for
15,01him.

15,01        She walked along the well-trodden path home, through the small forest
15,01land bordering the school. But as she was about to turn the last corner and
15,01find herself half a block from home, she saw something strange.

15,01        It was a tree, but it had a sign on it. It was actually an ugly yellow
15,01sign, but then, there had never been any signs on the trees in the mini-forest
15,01to begin with anyways, yellow or otherwise. But enough about its color, or the
15,01odd chance that she should happen to notice it. It had writing on it, and this
15,01is what it said. NEED A LIFE? SEE US! SMITH'S CIRCUS OF TERRIBLY EXCITING
15,01THINGS! 1 MILE EAST OF THIS SIGN. PART TIME HELP WANTED.

15,01        Katherine didn't hesitate. She immediately started off in one
15,01direction, then stopped, remembering that she didn't know which way north was.
15,01She looked closer at the sign, and noticed a small compass in the upper corner.
15,01She smiled, turned around, and began walking towards what had to be so much
15,01more exciting than home. The sign dissolved into blue sparkle behind her, but
15,01she didn't notice.

15,01        She followed similar signs for a mile, and then she reached a small
15,01clearing. Had she been a cautious child, she would have noted that the small
15,01forest land had dimensions of only 15 feet by 15 feet, and she could no longer
15,01see any landmark that should have been recognizable.

15,01        But Katherine didn't notice the oddities of the clearing. A yellow sign
