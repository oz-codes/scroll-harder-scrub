15,011. Well, another month, another four disks.  While most people are playing that
15,01Prince song, the iCE crew seems to be humming "Can't Hold Me Down" (made famous
15,01again by that ravishing Puff Daddy).  Many people  spent the first month of the
15,01new year  by preparing for Y2k (mainly  purchasing assault rifles) but we spent
15,01it  by creating  some stunning eye candy and putting  together another  timely,
15,01quality release.

15,012. After satisfying his rite of passage by trekking the forbidden "lava walk of
15,01Hippahippamulango", Bmxmen was brought on the ship this month for his great 3D,
15,01his "close" relationship with  Epoch, and for getting one of  his models placed
15,01on  SoftImage's Industrial  art gallery.  Not bad!  Also this month  new to the
15,01crew was Funbaby.  And don't think they call him that for nothing!  We finished
15,01a comeback  this month  with the release of a  Black Guard  RIP, and Cooly, our
15,01favorite  AK-47-toting Israeli  grunt has returned  from the grips of  military
15,01service to do some  drawing.  If you remember Sober, you probably remember that
15,01incredible hirez of the Violator he released a  few years back - well he sent a
15,01buddy to us and his name is Shade.  He does some great freehand work  that will
15,01tantalize and titilate.

15,013. Unable to  comprehend the  meaning of  life, Hfaze took  one step  closer to
15,01immortality when  an artist on Moonshine Music released  a CD using his font on
15,01the cover!  If you remember, Hfaze released several truetype fonts in iCE packs
15,01last year.  Just think, using V2, you can search for *.ttf and find them all in
15,01a single search!

15,014. iCECON: East is  about to take place!  Most  people would  consider this  an
15,01internal  issue, but we like to think that everyone cares what we do, so here's
15,01the skinny!  February 5th, in NYC, iCE  is meeting and going  barhopping.  That
15,01means  you should be 21 or older, and bring  cash to buy  us all drinks for the
15,01chance to  bask in our  artistic haze.  Reported to  set foot on the  NYC scene
15,01will be west-coasters  Mass Delusion and Xten,  east-coast-haunters Force  Ten,
15,01Aneurysm, Cold and  Ugly, Epoch, new  member Bmxmen, Egghead, and  whoever else
15,01decides to  engage in craziness for a night.  According to sources close to the
15,01iCE team, there  will be several marriages between  iCE members and the nearest
15,01sturdy bar stool.

15,015. When Senior Staff  Sinned Soul decided to quit this month, most of the staff
15,01left with him to create a new group  called "Dnegel".  Suddenly, it was as if a
15,01moment of clarity settled upon these leaders and  then common sense set  in. We
15,01realized that there wasn't anything anyone could do to top the goat-sex-having,
15,01insider-stock-trading,  ultraHLE-playing,  eye-candy-creating  commonwealth  of
15,01independent artists that we like to call "iCE".  Scurrying  like a pack of rats
15,01headed  for higher ground  on the Titanic, we rejoined iCE and took power, then
15,01renamed the group iCE: The iCE Cream Experience.

15,016. Mongi says: look at http://www.hirez.org, the one-stop hirez shop!

15,017. As  part of  our  effort to  divest  some  of our holdings  and  expand  our
15,01portfolio, iCE  Incorporated sold off its  majority ownership of Disney and its
15,01subsidaries  including ESPN,  the Go Network, ABC, and  others.  For more info,
15,01consult our 10-Q form filed with the SEC.
