15,01        Thinking of you

15,01Under the solitary gaze,
15,01Of the waning moon.
15,01I found solitude,
15,01In the unbroken silence.

15,01Alone I gazed,
15,01With nothing but my thoughts.
15,01For fleeting moments,
15,01I thought of you.

15,01I don't really remember,
15,01The words you said to me
15,01Nor will I remember the tears
15,01I only remember you.

15,01Sometimes I wonder
15,01Where you may be now
15,01And with whom,
15,01But it doesn't really matter

15,01Times and people change,
15,01The seasons come and go.
15,01I hope you remember, that once
15,01I loved you more than life.
