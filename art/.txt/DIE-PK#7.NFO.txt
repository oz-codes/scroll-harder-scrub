11,01Most of the DiE Artists are  attending educational institutions, which affected
11,01the  amount  of work  done in  Febuary.  In most people's  mind, skool  is more
11,01important that DiE.  Though not flick's. :)

11,01All the DiE Packs can be found on the internet site WASP.ENG.UFL.EDU !! This is
11,01our semi - official internet distribution site.  It would  be good to get  this
11,01demo/art site rocking.  So if you are in  another art group, upload  your packs
11,01to this site aswell!

11,01From the start  we planned  to release packs whenever we felt there  was enough
11,01work to release one.  So if you do  not see any work from us for a while, never
11,01think we have folded!

11,01Flick  is  organising  an  Australian  Art Magazine, Funk, which  is due  to be
11,01released  sometime in the next few months.  If you are involved  in an art/demo
11,01group, especially  an  Australian group, feel  free to submit  an article.  Any
11,01article  related to  the Art scene  would be accepted, so  if you think you can
11,01write  a  quality  article  do  so.  For  more  information  contact  flick  at
11,01flick@cloud.apana.org.au!

00,01[11JOB VACANCY00]  **WANTED**  11One super tuned courier to pick up the DiE pack from
11,01an FTP site, and upload it to 3  boards in the US, and one  in Canada.  The DiE
11,01packs are  released  every 1-2 months, so really it is  not too much of a task.
11,01This   can  be  a   very  rewarding  job!   Apart  from  being   able  to  sign
11,01" / DiE Productions '94 ", you will also be blessed by all of the DiE Crew, and
11,01if you were ever to visit Australia we would even share all our babes with You!
11,01Send your applications to the internet address listed below!

11,01We are having some  problems with people signing DiE, when they are not in DiE.
11,01Those who have not submitted  any work over a long period of time, and have not
11,01got in  contact with  me, most  likely can consider  themselves ex-members.  We
11,01are stream-lining  the members in DiE.  Only  the good, productive members will
11,01be retained.  For  a complete list of DiE Members, see  the  DiE-PK#7.MEM file.
11,01That is 100% official, and 100% accurate.

11,01Now I would like to welcome the new members.  Err member! Pysberman, a talented
11,01ANSi artist from Adelaide!  Who said the SA scene was povo!

11,01Finally  DiE has a  literature diversion.  This diversion is  based in the USA,
11,01and is being run  solely by The Dark Half.  Order your  literature today!  Also
11,01Assault and DiE are doing some  joint projects.  Not as successfully as I would
11,01of liked, but still it is a happening thing.  Assault are basically the premier
11,01Lit dudes in the scene, and we are very happy to work with them.

11,01In  the next few  months we will be concentrating  on recruiting more  artists.
11,01Both experienced  and inexperienced.  So if you would like to join  DiE, apply!
11,01We will assist  you as much as we can, and  help develop your  artistic talent.
