15,01                   00AND HIS DETRIMENT TO AMERICAN SOCIETY
02,01-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

00,01INTRODUCTION
15,01Uhh, so this is overstated a bit. But it's true. Trendkill ripped me off. Grr.


00,01BACKGROUND
15,01Basically, he msged me on irc some evening and offered me $25 to do him a long
15,01ansi, "about 100 lines." Needless to say, I did, after explaining my system
15,01(anyone whos paid me for ansis before knows it and understood it) of needing
15,01the money first, because I've been ripped off a couple times before. He agreed.
15,01He said that he needed it that night.

15,01I finished the ansi in about 3 or 4 hours (00lm-tril.ans15 in ecl-09) and tried to
15,01find him. He wasn't there, and hadn't been for a while (I asked around). I
15,01stayed on for a few hours since I needed some money, but he didn't come on at
15,01all that night. I didnt see him until PainKiler msged me, "hi man." Painkiler
15,01is Trendkill.

15,01            through, and now youre trying to collect. tell me why that's 
15,01            wrong.
15,01<12PainKiler15> because i send ya the money and it should arrive 
15,01            every day now and u should send them now please!

15,01<00Lago15>      i have no money.
15,01<00Lago15>      therefore ... well .. you could figure it out.
15,01<00Lago15>      if i dont see the money in a week, i think ill know the 
15,01            case.

15,01<00Lago15>      think hard about that
15,01<12PainKiler15> i didnt
15,01<00Lago15>      yeah, id guessed that.
15,01<00Lago15>      its hard to make it out from your nifty english here, but 
15,01            you just said it was already sent out and should arrive any day
15,01<12PainKiler15> i will send it as soon as u send the other ansi`s

15,01<12PainKiler15> o.k i lied but i will send it just please send the 
15,01            ansi`s
15,01<00Lago15>      tell me why you lied; if you didnt send the money and had 
15,01            no real intention of doing it soon, why would you tell me that 
15,01            you had? 
15,01<00Lago15>      what was your board anyways?
