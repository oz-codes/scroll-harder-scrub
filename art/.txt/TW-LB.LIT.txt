15,01Looking Back
15,01By The Warden [FLiP]

15,01I look back upon the past
15,01The time when I was down
15,01The time of suicidal thoughts
15,01When I was ready to take
15,01My life into my own hands
15,01And end it all

15,01My best friend said to me
15,01Those words of hope
15,01And the reasons to live

15,01Those powerful words
15,01Change the flow of suicidal thoughts
15,01Into wanting to live
15,01And to remain alive

15,01I hate to think
15,01What could have happened
15,01What I might have done to myself
15,01Without the caring words
15,01And the person behind them
15,01That took my life
15,01And saved it upon her heart

15,01I will say now and forever
15,01Thank you for being there for me
15,01And saving my life

15,01Love The Warden
