15,011. X-Net
15,01--------

15,01This net has been in the back of my head ever since I started my own board.
15,01But I never had the guts to start it cuz I didn't know dick about anything...
15,01I still don't, but hey.  Anyways, I've joined ViViD and since then and I've 
15,01learned alot, so I decided to start it up.  It focuses on "Art Scene" type 
15,01stuff. (ie: ansi, coding, modding...) 

15,012. ViViD
15,01--------

15,01The best kick ass group in 6i3. If you wish to become part of ViViD or just 
15,01want to know what it's about, write in the ViViD support Echo on any ViViD 
15,01distro site. Or download a pack.


15,013. Rules (yay)
15,01--------------

15,01Rule #1:  Keep to the subject, there's a general chatter if you want to write
15,01          about other stuff.

15,01The other rules you'll learn as you go along.
