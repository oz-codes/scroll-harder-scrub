15,01 EXPLANATION:
15,01   
15,01   This is a neat addition to the plain logoff command written into PCBoard.
15,01   It allows a logoff auto message, message to the sysop, logoff ansis, and
15,01   a feature to abort the logoff (complete with a rude message).

15,01 INSTALLATION:

15,01   Create a directory and copy the contents of this .zip into it...
15,01   Next, run PCBSETUP to modify your CMD.LST. Assign this PPE to whatever
15,01   you want the logoff commands to be (G, BYE, etc...). Make sure it
15,01   looks like this:

15,01     !<ppepath>\LOGOFF.PPE

15,01 USAGE:
15,01  
15,01   This PPE is simple to run... it contains a menu of options, but it also
15,01   accepts a commandline, so the user can stack commands in the logoff 
15,01   sequence (ie G Y). 

15,01   I assumed that if you were using command stacking, you were either sick
15,01   of the logoff procedure or were in a hurry, so when you stack logoff
15,01   commands, you bypass the logoff menu and the logoff ansi.
