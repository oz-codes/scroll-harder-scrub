15,01                  Lapse November Newsletter and Commentary

15,01Well, October came and went quickly, TOO quickly for the artists, as you might
15,01notice.  Lapse's musicians did an excellent job this month; luckily Lapseview
15,01has .S3M support, so almost everybody can hear the professional-quality tunes.
15,01Game continues to do an excellent job in the music department of Lapse.

15,01Next month will be a more productive month for Lapse ANSI and AGSE artists--
15,01unfortunately we couldn't get as much done this month as we wanted.  The 
15,01artwork that WAS done, by Ghent and T/+E, was good.  Look for a lot of 
15,01ansi next month, since most of the artists have several projects in the 
15,01works already <myself included>.

15,01Until next month.. ciao.

15,01Delirium Tremens [Lapse]


15,01     Another month, another pack.  Ok, let me get right to the
15,01point <grin>.  This month there was not much ANSI or AGSE, but
15,01there was a TON of music and it all RULED.  We were thinking of
15,01just releasing a music pack this month, but eventually decided to
15,01keep a "full" pack with emphasis on the music.  If you've enjoyed
15,01Lapse music in the past, you will thoroughly enjoy what we have
15,01to offer this month.
15,01     Game graces us with his usual skill with two excellent
15,01S3M's, one of which Ghent partially wrote.  Ghent and Insanitor
15,01also contributed greatly with their usual plethora of good music,
15,01and even I was able to get 2 S3M's in this pack.  LapseView
15,01should be able to cater to all your music listening, ANSI
15,01viewing, or AGSE viewing needs!
15,01     A little plug: For those of you interested in what the AGSE
15,01format is (you may have seen us using that format for VGA), I
15,01have now got a BBS up and running that supports on-line AGSE (ie,
15,01you can view the VGA over your modem.)  It is very fast.  If you
15,01would like to demo this, the number is 801-944-5421, with a fast
15,0128.8k modem on-line.
15,01     No major improvements with LapseView this month.  The format
15,01was changed around a little bit, but I didn't really have time to
15,01work on it because I had to do those S3M's, plus try my hand at
15,01AGSE.  F8 now stops music (yes!), and the F6 scheme has been
15,01disabled.  LapseView is kind of in an interim stage right now,
15,01but it is better than last month.  F6 does nothing for the time
15,01being, it will eventually be used to view the title and
15,01instrument lists from S3M's (so you can see all the comments from
15,01the authors).
15,01     I am very pleased this month that the music department
15,01stepped in and saved us.  I anticipate that November will be a
15,01slow month for most groups out there, so it's a big relief that
15,01we are releasing on time (November 1st) AND with some quality
15,01ART.  ENJOY!!!

15,01     --The Red Flame [Lapse Coding Coordinator]

15,01   Well, if nothing else, this month has been a good one for
15,01the music department... We've gotten a ton of music done this
15,01month. Thanks go out to Ghent, Insanitor, and The Red Flame 
15,01for making sure that are pack was of a respectable size. :)
15,01   All of them kicked butt this month.. And I got a couple of
15,01pieces in as well.. I'm still getting used the the module
15,01format, but I'm starting to get the nick of it.. As are all 
15,01of the other music contributing lapse members.. So look for
