15,01        The teeth of the many bite the lives of
15,01lost thoughts.  Drifting through the open minds
15,01of the old ones.  Falling through the cracks of

15,01Hail America.

15,01Hail America.
15,01Home of the Brave.

15,01The Button sticks.
15,01The room fills with red.
15,01The End.
