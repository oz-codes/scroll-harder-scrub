15,01had received $70,000 from The Phantages Educational Society, and 
15,01more than $15,000 in royalties after that.  He had married Helen 
15,01a year before that, he could remember, because that was the year 
15,01he had killed that college student in a car accident.  It wasn't 
15,01his fault, he always maintained that.ed, 34 year old hands,

15,01played on the street outside.  Len could almost see himself 
15,01     "No...."g some pepper with the neighbours..

15,01     They never knew that, did they?  Because the other guy was 
15,01drunk too, and you had the right of way, right?  

15,01     "Never knew..."
15,01     "Hey Len!  Me and the guys might start a scratch team for

15,01driving, will ya?was Wilson Kelly, the grubby faced kid who 
15,01always played catcher.
15,01     "Stop.."  He could hear the voices.. the maddening, crazy 
15,01voices, tormenting him.else is gonna play?"  

15,01     "I need a drink."  He kicked over some cushions, looking for
15,01the bottle of Tin Star he had found in his wife's jewellery safe. 
15,01He found it under some books, opened the bottle, and took a long 
15,01drink.  Once satisfied with the first, he took another.
15,01     "OK, no problem.  When's the first game?"
15,01     "Helen, this one's for you." He motioned the bottle towards 
15,01the front of the room, and took yet another drink.  He was almost
15,01drunk, but he could still remember...out of the house, a bottle 
15,01of Tin Star whisky in his hand, and yelled something 
15,01     prehensible.  He motioned towards Len.

15,01     "AUGH!!!! HELEN! HELEN!!!!" he cried.  Len was in a blind 
15,01rage.  All he could see was red.  He picked up a book and flung 
15,01it across the room.  It almost hit his wife as she walked into 
15,01the living room.  An incredible mess was before her - the 
15,01cabinets had been emptied, dishes broken, empty bottles 
15,01everywhere.  "WHERE'S THE TIN STAR??????" his house.

15,01     "Honey, I told you no more, you're screwing yourself up."  
15,01She said it gently, calmly, enunciating each word like he was a 
15,01child.  He was breathing like an ox, heaving each breath, ain
15,01anticipating the explosion.  "Go work on your script.  Your 
15,01deadline is in a couple of weeks, and you've hardly started."

15,01     "BITCH!  SHUT UP!  GIVE ME THE GODDAMN TIN STAR NOW!!!!"  He
15,01grabbed her by both arms, and squeezed them tightly.I'll get to 
15,01them in a second, just let me call the other guys about our 
15,01     "Ahh!!!!  Len!  Stop!  You're hurting me!"  she screamed, s 
15,01tears forming in her eyes.  "Please Len, stop!  Stop it!"

15,01     He shook her, hard.  Helen could feel her organs rattling ce
15,01inside her, feel her arm slowly becoming useless due to the just 
15,01stopped circulation. took a swig from the bottle, "just shut the 
15,01hell up and go to your room.. but do the dishes first!"  Another 
15,01     "TELL ME!  TELL ME NOW!!!!!!!" Len roared.  His wife, almost
15,01unconscious before him, moaned helplessly.m his lips.  How he 
15,01could drink that junk all day, Len didn't know.
15,01     The front door opened.  Len went white.
15,01     "Who do you think you are?"  Len roared.  What now, he 
15,01     "Mom?  Dad?"  It was George.  Len heard the door close.  He 
15,01dropped Helen on the floor, hitting her head on the coffee table. 
15,01An eerie sense of deja vu struck Len full force, and he reeled ed
15,01backwards a little.  "Hey guess what!  I made the baseball team! 
15,01The junior 8 year old squad!  Mom?  Dad?"g through his right 
15,01temple.
15,01     Len picked up his son's baseball bat and hid around the 
15,01corner of the main hall.  George walked down to the living room, 
15,01happy, unknowing, safe in his mind...
15,01     What was he doing, messing with his father when he's had a 
15,01     "Mom?  Dad?"him?  This was madness.....

15,01     One more step, punk...ou're nothing but a drunk bastard!"  
15,01The last two words reverberated around the room, surrounding 
15,01     "Mom... MOM!!!!"  He saw her, lying on a crooked angle, it 
15,01build up..
15,01mouth open, head cut and bleeding.
