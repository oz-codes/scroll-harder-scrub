08,01 14------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14,01 00#  15Welcome to the 7th TRiBE Archive(-LiTE).  It's the Holiday season, and we
15,01    TRiBE Guys don't take this stuff seriously enough to do alot this time of
15,01    the year.  It's now 1994, and we're going onto our 8th Month (January '94)
15,01    of existance.  Remember when TRiBE was a "One-Man-Group" with only myself?
15,01    God, it seems like only yesterday it was the iCEAGE, ACiD wasn't doing dick
15,01    and I, as iCE Senior Staff was all too happy to point it out.  Today, iCE
15,01    is mainly in Canada and calling themselves GOTHIC, ACiD is full of little
15,01    dicks like Kronos, but you have to admit they're clearly kicking iCEASS.
15,01    Six months from now, the Teeter-Totter that is the Scene may very well be
15,01    the exact opposite, who knows.  Of course, you're dealing with TRiBE guys
15,01    here and now, so we say, who cares. . .

15,01 00#  15Gee, you'd think we had a membership drive!  This may take awhile...

15,01 00#  15BeeZ is in from Mirage XXIVIII: The Reconstructification.  He wanted to
15,01    actually get his ANSi's released from time to time.  For those interested,
15,01    yes, his voice is getting deeper!  (Ducking)

15,01 00#  15Asriel makes an ASSAULT on The Spawning Ground to become a TRiBE Member!
15,01    For your own safety, we suggest you do not ask him to draw you an ANSi...
15,01         (Warning: Inside Joke, you're not meant to understand it...)

15,01 00#  15Dark Deception, the Independant in from the HEAT, a rappatapptappin.
15,01    Our little yuletide drummer boy earns us the Sub-Title: Logos'r'us!

15,01 00#  15Village Idiot was a BAD boy, he joined TRiBE.  His very first ANSi ever is
15,01    included here.  Not a bad begining.  (Honest!  I barely touched it, Ben.)

15,01 00#  15King Midas, our new Southern Knight!  Another talent dug up from the
15,01    dreggs of 4O4.  He's a reletive newcomer to ANSi, only "months old".  Of
15,01    course, I remember Leper Messiah's and Quazar's first ANSi's locally,
15,01    and neither were this good, this early on.  I shudder to think where he'll
15,01    be three months from now, talent wise.

15,01 00#  15Mr. Sinister, ANOTHER 4O4er!  He's here to help us with coding and prose,
15,01    while we help him with his ANSi skills.  NaG and iMAGE have made use of
15,01    his doings, but now he's doing with us.  Just don't give him your voice
15,01    number, eh... ;)

15,01 04#  15This just in!  This just in!  Killean has left ACiD.  The forgotten man
15,01    at ACiD (or was that ignored) now completes our collection of Great 404
15,01    Artists.  (Can you believe it?  They called him a "coder", apparently
15,01    ashamed of his ANSi?   Check out his new ANSi!)  Even with TLGX gone,
15,01    he just couldn't get any respect.  Now he's going to play with us!  He
15,01    may even do ANSi's for boards other than Free Beer, someday!  Oh yeah,
15,01    and he can code too.  Won't be needing ANSIM much longer...

15,01 #  14(Digression: Is 4O4 being ignored by all the other groups, or do they
15,01     14just conceed it to TRiBE?  Things that make you go huh-huh-huh-huh.)

14,01 00#  15You'll see LogaN's "Lost" Paradigm Cover ANSi in this Archive.  Since
15,01    Issue #3 wasn't released, and won't be, he's free to release it now.
15,01    Gotta admit, it is classic Logiepoo, eh?  For those who don't know, he
15,01    is in 4O4.

15,01 00#  15Speaking of Logiepoo, you'll find a .PCX file of his included in this
15,01    Archive.  Apon my rebirth (New Computer) I'd wanted to put together a
15,01    special Christmas greet to the Scene.  Nothing fancy, just alittle loader
15,01    that'd show off LogaN's VGA talent, as well as play some very appropriate
15,01    music.  ("It's Christmas in Heaven" - Monty Python Sings.)  Alas, it was
15,01    not to be, as the evil Grynch stole our X-Mas coder.  So, we're just going
15,01    to release the .PCX and leave the coding crap to ACiD.  (Remeber, iCE
15,01    coders have better things to do!)
