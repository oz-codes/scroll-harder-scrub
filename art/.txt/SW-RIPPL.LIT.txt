15,01- ripples -


15,01One touch of the web is all it takes -
15,01To seal your fate; make or break.
15,01Brush the web just once again,
15,01And touch the spider's poisoned pain.
15,01Reverberations that stem forever -
15,01Ripples that touch your every endeavor.
15,01Diffusion of your every thought
15,01Stemming to all that time has wraught.
15,01Random patterns like shattered glass
15,01Echo reflections from your past -
15,01Your every choice, your every stand
15,01Makes a mark in the hearts of men.
15,01Yet like a tree, you also bend,
15,01Blown by the breath of fated winds;
15,01Tossing and turning in a hurricane,
15,01Weakened by the pounding rain;
15,01Trying your best to still the storm,
15,01Feeling your web ripped and torn -
15,01Your demons descend just like your blessings,
15,01Both extending beyond your window dressings -
15,01Showing people your truth and mind -
15,01Reflections that ripple through all time,
15,01Bringing the spider upon your brow;
15,01Praying to escape the here and now.
15,01But others often cause ripples, too -
15,01Likely as not, their spider is you;
15,01Though you never turn to face life,
15,01Often its your hand that kills the sacrifice -
15,01Spider in nature - with poisoned teeth,
15,01Ridding the innocent of their peace -
15,01Yet guilty only of the nature of man;
15,01Tearing the web with your innocent hands.
15,01This is life as man has made,
15,01Caught up in an endless charade.
15,01Embracing death only when you find
15,01That you've fallen from the web of time.
