15,01Damnation

15,01waking each morning with the hate and anger that 
15,01this life has given you
15,01tears of blood stain your cheeks
15,01reliving the nightmares that you had just dreamt
15,01and knowing they will come true
15,01all your nightmares come true
15,01screaming "Why God.. why..."
15,01then silence comes into the room
15,01the stench of death fills the room
15,01your blood runs cold
15,01your heart beats louder and louder
15,01you hear a voice.. the voice of the demonic master
15,01he is here to make a deal
15,01a deal that will be signed in blood
15,01you can have anything you want.. all for one price
15,01your eternal soul...
