15,01Introduction
15,01------------

15,01    In the midst of moral decay, the staff came to an agreement; either
15,01the communication between our members inprove, or there might not be a
15,01Shiver much longer. What we needed was a mail network, this was obvious.

15,01Overview
15,01--------

15,01    As of today, ShiverNet is now in session. All the distro and headquarter
15,01boards now require this network, without valid excuse. If one decides 
15,01that they do not want to take the network, then so be it, there are many
15,01boards around this continent which would love to be a part of Shiver.
15,01For those of you whom are reading this, and are going to setup the echos
15,01as soon as you are completed, I commend you. It will be those that do not
15,01want to poll any hub in the Us. That is where it will be hard to get them
15,01to change their ways.

15,01Polling
15,01--------

15,01    Any board may poll any other board. It is very simple, and if anyone
15,01has difficulties doing so, get in contact with me, and I will show/help
15,01you accomplish that. The Canadian Hub will be: The Crimson Waters -
15,01Shiver Chq, while the United States Polling Hq will be our new advisor
15,01Betrayer in the 408 area code. 

15,01    Polling will occur no less than once a week without valid excuse. If
15,01you so desire, you may poll up to three times a week to instill that the 
15,01conversations are taking place and are getting processed to the other 
15,01nodes of the system.

15,01    Packet size should be extremely small. I would expect that you would
15,01be paying no more than $1.20 a month (4 polls of 30 cents). One poll
15,01in it's entirety should last no longer than 30 seconds. One call from
15,01The United States to Canada is only 30 cents per minuite. So long as you 
15,01stay under that minute polling time, you should be fine.

15,01Closing
15,01-------

15,01    I would personally like to take this time to thank each of you for
15,01your support not only with the network, but with Shiver Productions as
15,01well. Without your help, we would have nothing to show for it. Stay
15,01tuned for further innovations produced by the staff onhand. We are 
15,01currently seeking new means to see that our staff is at 100% eye level
15,01with each other; if a group is not comunicationg, it is no group at all.
15,01                

15,01P.S :)
15,01------

15,01    There are now atleast 5 new bases as of August 22. The main ones were
15,01suggested by Sharp of The Dark Society. If you would like to suggest a base
15,01for your group, poll 613-825-8934, or talk to me via #Shiver. Try and setup
15,01all bases, and I will see you in the message bases!
