15,01                           of Reality productions
15,01                      for my compadres in CiA, farewell.

15,01Farewell

15,01Farewell 
15,01The victors have fallen asleep
15,01It's time once again...
15,01Another tragedy of living,
15,01We breath too hard,
15,01And live too loudly-

15,01Farewell
15,01Never to be seen again,
15,01Snuffed out like a light,
15,01Killed in the midst of dreaming,
15,01Walking on eggshells,
15,01I get depressed so easily-

15,01Goodbye
15,01Good times,
15,01Nothing is perment,
15,01Nothing lives too long,
15,01Out of the lonely darkness we were formed,
15,01To walk across those thoughts we fear,
15,01And to climb to the ultimate experience,
15,01So that we can laugh no more-

15,01Farewell
15,01Do not rejoice gentle opposition,
15,01We are not your enemy.
15,01I will spread my wings quitely,
15,01Without a stir...
15,01And fly to freedom's edge,
15,01To cry at the Gates of Dawn,
15,01To make one last gesture of good will,
15,01To smile down upon the unhappy masses,
15,01Forever weeping to the sound of a closing door
15,01That whispers through the night,
15,01That carries with it a pocketfull of dreams,
15,01To cry...-

15,01One last final exeunt,
15,01Finis,
15,01By the place of forbidden feelings,
15,01In the face of opposing forces,
15,01Tied down by the rivers of depression,
15,01A storm will rise out of every livable moment,
15,01Until that keeper must rise...
15,01And sing a soft prayer in my ear:

15,01        "A loaded gun won't set you free,
15,01                So you say...."

15,01All forewarning an end to sorrow,
15,01All structured around that final moment,
15,01The final farewell-
