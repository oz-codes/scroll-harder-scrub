03,01Moon's commin02g over the rise,
03,01Think i'll he02ad into town,
03,01Bright and fu02ll in the sky,
03,01Something's g02oing down.

03,01I think i'll 02change tonight,
03,01Something is 02affecting me so,
03,01Their's fire 02in my blood,
03,01Full of rage, 00s02omething must go.

03,01Full moon's u00p ton02ight,
03,01It's light sh00ines o02ff my teeth,
03,01It shines off 00my cl02aws,
03,01This is going 00to e02nd in a fight.

03,01Anticipation, 00wa02iting, ready,
03,01I know what i02s going to happen,
03,01It's all been 02done before,
03,01Just waiting 02for the situation to ripen.

03,01There he is, 02waiting for me,
03,01we'll soon fi02nd out who is stronger,
03,01Pity flushed 02you of this killers heart,
03,01Consumed by t02his primal hunger.
