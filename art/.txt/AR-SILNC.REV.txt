15,01silence

15,01all are silent, none have woken
15,01you and I remain, unspoken
15,01lying under a starlit night
15,01wishing not; for morning's light
15,01you take me from this tragic place
15,01love is found, in your embrace
15,01all my life, revolves 'round you
15,01everything you say and do
15,01and though harsh times may split us 'part
15,01you'll always wander, in my heart.
