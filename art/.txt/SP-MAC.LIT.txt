15,01He is a great hero, from his head to his toes
15,01And his great deeds are unmatched by any
15,01But now, he has hit his worst lows,
15,01And his fall into evil has been uncanny

15,01It started off by killing Duncan, the king
15,01A mistake which was horrible and rash
15,01It was late at night that he did the thing
15,01And it would make him mean hearted and brash.

15,01Now, he has fallen into a pit of evil
15,01From which he will never leave
15,01But for this king there will be no upheavel
15,01Becuase in life, he is still stuck in a sieve

15,01So who is this man whose life is full of despair?
15,01This man who will die for a lost cause?
15,01It is the only man to live with no hope
15,01For this man is Macbeth.
