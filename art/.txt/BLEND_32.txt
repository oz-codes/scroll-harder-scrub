15,01Friends,

15,01Now that most of us are even more intimately involved with the electronic
15,01device you are watching, a short pause may be in order.  The following was
15,01gleaned while surfing the big wave.
15,01           25 SIGNS THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS TAKEN OVER YOUR LIFE

15,011.  Your stationary is more cluttered than Martha Stuart's weekly calendar.
15,01 The letterhead lists a fax number, e-mail addresses for two on-line
15,01services, and your Internet address, which spreads across the breadth of the
15,01letterhead and continues on the back.  In essence, you have conceded that the
15,01first page of any letter you write *is* letterhead.

15,012.  You have never sat through an entire movie without having at least one
15,01device on your body beep or buzz.

15,013.  You need to fill out a form that must be typewritten, but you can't find
15,01a typewritter that works.

15,014.  You think of the gadgets in your office as "friends", but forgot to send
15,01your honey a birthday card.

15,015.  You disdain people who use low baud rates.

15,016.  When you go to a computer store, you eavesdrop on a salesperson talking
15,01with customers and you butt in to correct him and spend the next twenty
15,01minutes answering the customer's questions, while the salesperson stands
15,01silently, nodding his head.

15,017.  You use the phrase "digital compression" in a conversation without
15,01thinking how strange your mouth feels when you say it.

15,018.  You find yourself in groups of people to whom you say the phrase "digital
15,01compression".  Everyone understands what you mean, and you are not surprised
15,01that you don't have to explain it.

15,019.  You know Bill Gates' e-mail address, but you have to look up your own
15,01social security number.

15,0110. You stop saying "phone number" and replace it with "voice number", since
15,01we all know the majority of phone lines in any house are plugged into
15,01contraptions that talk to other contraptions.

15,0111. You sign holiday cards by putting : ) next to your signature.

15,0112. Off the top of your head, you can think of ninteen keystroke symbols that
15,01are far more clever than  : )

15,0113.  You back up your data every day.

15,0114. Your wife asks you to pick up some minipads for her at the store and you
15,01return with a rest for your mouse.

15,01faster than everyone else who are all reading John Grisham novels.

15,0116. The thought that a CD could refer to finance or music rarely enters your
15,01mind.

15,0117. You go to computer trade shows and map your path of the exhibit hall in
15,01advance.  However, you cannot give someone directions to your house without
15,01looking up the street names.

15,0118. You would rather get more dots per inch than miles per gallon.

15,0119. You own a set of itty bitty screw drivers and you actually know where
15,01they are.

15,0120. While contemporaries swap stories about recent hernia surgeries, you
15,01compare mouse induced finger strain with a nine year old.

15,0121. You rotate your screen savers more frequently than your automobile tires.

15,0122. You have ended friendships because of irreconcilably different opinions
15,01about which is better:  the track ball or the track *pad*.

15,0123. You are so knowledgeable about technology that you feel secure enough to
15,01say "I don't know" when someone asks you a technology question instead of
15,01feeling compelled to make something up.
