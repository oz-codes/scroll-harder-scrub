15,01 five meat pies
15,01 hover
15,01 between and underneath and inside
15,01 the smooth wooden platform
15,01 ten feet away 
15,01 but further than the disc
15,01 that isn't beside
15,01 the rotating fungus
15,01 that has five fairy passengers
15,01 all bound for finland
15,01 frolicking freely
15,01 in anticipation 
15,01 of the other side.
15,01 Motherly pumpkins
15,01 with their benevolent gaze
15,01 melt their children to the ground
15,01 which understands.  Thus
15,01 are contented the 
15,01 tiny victims of polka-dot fever?
15,01 Yes.
15,01 Bookmarks twirling, they
15,01 dive into expected action
15,01 to the tune of a 
15,01 Wagner aria.
15,01 Sharpened and ready,
15,01 the pixie folk launch their
15,01 heads
15,01 at the flying cupcake of death!
15,01 She was most defimately not amused.
15,01 Because it revealed her identity as a Reese's peanut butter cup
15,01 Taking out her
15,01 peanut butter insides, she hopped happily away
15,01 to start a new 
15,01 life, away from all this
15,01 trivial mad existance in the war of deserts.
15,01 Soon the deserts won, which
15,01 led to swamp drainage and landscape
15,01 sprinkled with sandy flags
15,01 and primitive ironing boards! (ungh!)
15,01 Then out came the evil 
15,01 good fairie princesses
15,01 with the blue-stained wand and the
15,01 really short, pink mini-skirts, with
15,01 gossamer shoelaces, whose hidden powers
15,01 of chastity and perfumery and haberdashery
15,01 tied up the evil snakes of socials teachers and annoying parents
15,01 so that over-protected children of the planet pooh could be free and
15,01 and burn down the school like in the Pink Floyd movie and
15,01 glow.
15,01 Meanwhile, the meat pies
15,01 are content baking in the oven
15,01 which surrounds them all
15,01 with barbed wire fences 
15,01    and women with hot pink mini-skirts, when
15,01 suddenly a one track mind swallowed them whole.
15,01 it then tottered off, muttering something about proctologists.
15,01 and dreams of lightbulbs and flashlights
15,01 dancing through a clear night sky
15,01 went through the head of the nameless traveller.
15,01 and out. Their pencils sharpenened and 
15,01    and out came the evil erasers. They
15,01 proceeded to "rub out" everybody
15,01 and spaghetti, purple and stringy, climbed slowly over
15,01 the top. Ready for the umbrelloids, they were
15,01 big, and they looked like umbrellas!!!  Suddenly, they
15,01 looked more thither, and brambly, as the gorse and thicket of
15,01 a thousand mongolian warriors on tricycle.
15,01 Dragging their freshly baked loaves of corn bread behind them, 
15,01 the unleavened toastmen conquered all they encountered.
15,01 Meanwhile, on 1775894.57th street...
15,01 the 695 17757894.57th street and granville bus stopped to pick up a passeng
15,01    which turned out to be a late-night prostitute.  She
15,01 saw the light of day and turned to ash. The 
15,01 meat pies were also not amused.
15,01 as they're almost done and don't want to see ashes
15,01 where british telecom repairmen should be.
15,01 and they pulled out the phone line and stuff
15,01    the cords down there throat, suddenly
15,01 aware of its nonsensical placement in a sentence,
15,01   and wondered how he came out with such big words.
