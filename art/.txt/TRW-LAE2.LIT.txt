15,01                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        Darryl McAlister was stretched out on his side in front of an open
15,01window on the fifth floor of the Eaton Centre. One hand was wrapped around
15,01the handgrip of his medium-to-long range Windrider rifle while the other
15,01casually placed a three-ounce broad-tipped stun dart loaded with a few drops
15,01of horse tranquilizer into the manual feeder housing at the top of the gun.
15,01        His spotter, Eric Turnbull, was laid out next to him with an
15,01RSG-Sniper, a .30 caliber medium-range rifle. Worn over Turnbull's left eye
15,01was a Range Piece, a little gadget made of metal, plastic and glass designed
15,01especially for snipers to calculate large distances between the wearer and
15,01the target using radar.
15,01        "Range me," said McAlister who, because he was the primary shooter,
15,01didn't wear an eyepiece of any sort.
15,01        "600 metres," Turnbull replied.
15,01        McAlister reached a thin, telescoping antenna out into the night breeze
15,01and took a windspeed reading. He frowned at the small LCD display taped to
15,01the windowsill and said "With this wind, maximum range would be..." -- he
15,01counted quickly on his fingers -- "...about 200 metres; optimum range..." --
15,01more counting -- "...125 metres."
15,01        Turnbull groaned tiredly and announced into the radio "This is Bottle
15,01Rocket. Target zone at 200 metres; blank at 125."
15,01        Down the street, the two targets suddenly stopped.
15,01        "What are they doing?" hissed McAlister, annoyed.
15,01        "Looks like they're arguing about something," said a voice, presumably
15,01belonging to Black Cat who was doing street surveillance in a car by the
15,01road. 
15,01        "Shit, this could get complicated if they split up now," Turnbull
15,01whispered and scowled.
15,01        McAlister gazed silently through the scope mounted at the top of his
15,01rifle while waving an impatient hand at Turnbull, telling him to shut up.
15,01        Turnbull replied by flipping McAlister the finger and then returning to
15,01his Range Piece, not saying a word.

15,01        Kosk stopped in mid-sip. The two targets ahead were undoubtly arguing
15,01about something or other. The plan was starting to stray off-course and
15,01that, aided by the massive amounts of caffine that he had sucked down so far
15,01that night, was making him nervous.
15,01        He set his coffee down on the dash and got the night vision binoculars
15,01out of the glove compartment.
15,01        "What are they saying?" Sifton asked impatiently.
15,01        Kosk, who was the surveillance man because of his lip-reading skills,
15,01watched them intently with his mouth drawn slightly open. "Lover's quarrel,"
15,01he said finally and replaced the binoculars. "Now what?"
15,01        Sifton shifted a newly lit cigarette from one corner of his mouth to
15,01the other and hissed "Get the Coda ready. We may have to get in on this
15,01one." 
15,01        Kosk nodded and reached into the backseat and got out the Coda Netgun,
15,01a medium-sized gun designed especially for the live capture of humans and
15,01animals. He loaded a 12' x 12' net with 5" x 5" mesh onto the front and set
15,01the Coda in his lap.
15,01        Sifton picked up the radio and said "This is Black Cat. We're prepped
15,01for a drive-by. Please advise."
15,01        In the case of an assassination, the drive-by would have been preferred
15,01because it was quicker and had less chance to screw up but when the
15,01objective was live-capture, the tactics changed mainly because of two
15,01reasons: first off, the targets would be shooting to kill with live ammo
15,01while the Manhunters would be dodging around, fighting with kid-gloves.
15,01Secondly, the sound of a roaring car engine would tip the targets off and
15,01give them a chance for escape. Despite this, most of the Headhunters who
15,01work off bounties can't restrain themselves from attempting to pull off such
15,01a hit, particularly when it involved such a well-known target. Self-control
15,01and excellent teamwork were what the corporate Manhunters were paid for.
15,01        "Black Cat, this is Bottle Rocket. Drive-by only if they split up. Your
15,01target will be Karen James. Fire Wheel will take Elminster. Please stand by
15,01for signal."
15,01        "Black Cat copies that. We're waiting."
15,01        "Fire Wheel standing by."
15,01        Ahead, the bickering had apparently come to an end. Karen turned and
15,01continued to walk towards the target zone and Elminster began to follow
15,01behind. 
15,01        "Looks like we'll be able to take it," Bottle Rocket said.
15,01        Sifton held the radio receiver to his mouth and was about reply when
15,01the distant growl of a car engine made him stop. It got steadily louder
