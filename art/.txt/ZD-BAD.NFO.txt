15,01BAD 1 Year Anniversity Loader coded by Zodiac..

15,01This was created on 1/27/94 @ 11:49pm.. Hell, and its even a school night :)
15,01Well, the fade routines i used on this puppy i got from Dreadnought, another
15,01Bad coder.. And i also recieved misc. technical help from Number Cruncher as
15,01well.. Thanx guys.. Well. if you have any problems with this, or wanna yell
15,01at me for something bad i did.. Call Either Chasm, or Hurricane's board..
15,01I frequent those board often.. I know the MOD support does not have stereo
15,01sound, BUT, im using MOD-OBJ and that kinda sux. HOPEFULLY! me and dread will
15,01have DSMI soon.. so all will be good :) but for the time being, this will have
15,01to do.. I'm not sure if GUS support will be implemented before the release of
15,01the BAD anniversary pack.. but hopefully soon.. Oh well, if anyone ever needs
15,01anything done, or wants to talk to me.. feel free.. and if ANYONE knows where
15,01the hell SuMiXaM (aka SX) and iNTERLOPER are.. tell me.. i havent talked to
15,01those guys in about 5-6 months.. because they are too FORGETFUL to call me..
15,01(j/k).. BUT, gotta go.. later
