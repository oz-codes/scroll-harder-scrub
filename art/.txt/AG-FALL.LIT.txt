15,01the swastika clicks
15,01you were a cog
15,01I wound the watch
15,01after time stopped

15,01the desert of distance
15,01ostrich holes, bomb holes
15,01you removed shrapnel from heads
15,01I was told were rats

15,01burnt flesh
15,01is not dead

15,01that much death
15,01how to trust life.

15,01a face, a face, a face
15,01where do I take it
15,01to whom do I mail it
15,01what is the language of death,
15,01a rope that just ends

15,01you stabbed my soul
15,01I led an army
15,01we watch the replay
