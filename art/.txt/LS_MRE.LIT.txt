15,01Tribute to muh boy Mister E  =)

15,01Cruising down the highway one thing's on my mind
15,01Punks be fronting but he's got my behind
15,01Just like a boy scout he's always prepared
15,01Pulls all the stunts Bo Duke never dared
15,01Strapped to the fullest, all cower in fear
15,01Whenever they learn that he is coming near
15,01A lit writing mother fucker his farts be a-stinking
15,01His opposers see him coming their dicks are a-shrinking
15,01Fear and respect, the boy is on top
15,01Always tokin' izm, the nation's cash crop
15,01All the fly threads this boy is a-sporting
15,01The big breasted hoochies wish he was a-courting
15,01Them.  They want him, he takes it in stride
15,01Don't let a little pussy take over his pride
15,01Got his boys backs whenever they're feeling a bit queezy
15,01Bigger than Acid or Ice, the godfather is E.
