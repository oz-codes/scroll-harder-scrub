00,01   Hi, since I run the mango platoon wich is FiRE's Distro, Paranormal
00,01 thought it would be good if I said something.  Anything.  So here I am!
00,01 Ok FiRE is a modding group started by ViViD, and we are looking for any
00,01 one interested in joinging this modding crew.  Experience not necessary,
00,01 although it does help.  We are currently modding Iniquity and Renegade,
00,01 but if you know any other program you're good at modding, come join us!
00,01 I guess this is all I had to say...15       00- Maniac
