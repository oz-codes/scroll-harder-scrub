15,01there is a wind-gentle man at home
15,01  whose love, mystery, Ophelia
15,01is out in the woods picking nightingales' tongues
15,01     and skipping to the tunes she hears only within.

15,01   to claim that love
15,01   to claim that, love
15,01   
15,01        these nightingales build fine english castles
15,01     i, Ophelia and Medea in lesbian embrace,
15,01                will bear the child   
15,01conceived on the night of the aphrodesiac codeine -
15,01                                insensible and allergic
15,01                       but it is yours.

15,01           sheep sculpted of clay have been smashed
15,01         woolly pots, sweaters of the could-have-been
15,01                        but the sweetest teapots are eaten by harlots
15,01                  as beaver after beaver passes through my hands.

15,01     superiority comes with secrets that are not secrets -
15,01               exclusivity of sexuality (self) is the triumph
15,01                                     but i will not achieve.
15,01                       my secrets would be your secrets
15,01                  could you sit within the chambers of my ears
15,01                                and listen to the mutterings of my brain
15,01        in constant stutter-repetition in the skullish cavern.

15,01the seem is greater than the is.

15,01           skipping Ophelia, skulks Medea
15,01                       daintily  duality

15,01             Jormungander (and his representative on the bookshelf)
15,01     twist into symbols of infinity
15,01                        contorting spacetime in the process
15,01                    and Ophelia dreams on.

15,01          love, in claims of secrecy
15,01   and the more romantic for it whispered across glass panes
15,01                you claim that love.
