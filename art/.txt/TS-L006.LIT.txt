15,01        Etched memory

15,01I watched from my window,
15,01As the night took my hopes away
15,01The wind's cruel bite is deep
15,01And the loss in my heart is deeper.

15,01The walls around me are closing,
15,01And my fears offer little comfort.
15,01My heart called out to her,
15,01But my voice is lost in the wind.

15,01How I have missed her,
15,01That crazy, reassuring smile.
15,01Her gentle voice,
15,01And her loving touch.

15,01Even though she is far,
15,01And I will always miss her.
15,01I know someday, somehow
15,01She will remember me.
