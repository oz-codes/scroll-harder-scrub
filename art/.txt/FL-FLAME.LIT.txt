15,01The flame,
15,01is burning softly,
15,01Its time is coming.
15,01It has burned for too long,
15,01and its fire,
15,01is not needed anymore.
15,01This flame will not die,
15,01at least not fully.
15,01This is the flame
15,01which burns in the heart
15,01in the soul
15,01in the mind.
15,01Like a summer,
15,01which flies by quickly,
15,01as if to give you only one taste,
15,01then it is gone.
15,01AS if a shadow,
15,01fading fast with the light,
15,01this flame shall dissapear.
15,01But like these things,
15,01it shall be remembered, love, missed.
15,01Touch me!
15,01Feel this passion,
15,01this fire will not hurt.
15,01yet it taunts and teases,
15,01leaving you to always want more.
15,01This fire is your soul,
15,01This fire is you heart,
15,01This fire burns within you.
15,01I am the outsider,
15,01accompanying the flame.
15,01It is I who shall die,
15,01not this fire.
15,01One last kiss,
15,01then I say goodbye.

15,01                        Flame -Havok
