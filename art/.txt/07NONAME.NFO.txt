15,01good evening, it's new years eve; and im stuck at home with my parents, watching
15,01dave clark or whatever his name is.. fucking shitty. meanwhile, it's 1997 now,
15,01and we here at noname would like to say the following; noname brand ascii in
15,011997 - happy motherfucking new phear. we're gonna remain maniacally supreme this
15,01year, and if we don't keep contending.. then my name is not negroid jones.

15,01in light of new\returning\leaving members.. we had a fucking hay day this month,
15,01cheg it;  to start it off, my good friend flame returns to the tribe, to kick
15,01some flame stylee for us, now we're not sure how much work he'll have.. but it's
15,01damn good to have him back., in other news, haji comes off the inactive list,
15,01due to his quitting remorse ascii., defiant, an ascii pimp who moved over to us
15,01from the recently semi-deceased s0ap (rip), joined.. did one ascii, and decided
15,01to leave.. because he felt ascii wasn't for him, thats ok bro, much love., also
15,01d3mented, and skatter moved to us from s0ap (rip) to release their dopeness, one
15,01problem being the fact that i can't find d3mented.. ahh well, he'll show up
15,01eventually, they always do., the prodigy, a good bud of mine comes to us from
15,01his own group, odelay.. good to have him around., and one last pimp; caithor,

15,01cheg out his colly this month., ahh yes, one more tek, he's dope, no work this
15,01month though;  a big shout out to all new and returning members!

15,01umm, what else is there to talk about?.. ahh yes; the pack =). there is a few
15,01things you should really take the time to look at, number 1 being the *.bin's
15,01that are being released this month, they are REALLY good., big ups to polymorph
15,01and purify, the two swedes for drawing them =).  umm there really isn't much
15,01going on this month with us, we're just kicking ass. a couple things to look
15,01for are my all-ascii board - the deep - ., should be up soon, and big ups to
15,01necromancer by keeping bbs's alive with his telnet board - back in the day -.,
15,01good stuff there man. bah.

15,01-- cain closed off, mind idling..

15,01-- on january 1st, 1997., discyple had this to say..

15,01To whom it may concern,

15,01        An ascii is a light, delicate pancake with a French name.  It may
15,01be sprinkled with sugar and a few drops of lemon juice, or encase an
15,01unending variety of fillings.
15,01        Many great dishes evolve from simple beginnings.  An appetizer
15,01made from leftover ham, chicken or turkey tucked into an ascii, makes a
15,01perfect beginning to a fine meal.  Seafoods or vegetables may be incor-
15,01porated into a sauce and spread into an ascii for a main course.  A handful
15,01of fresh fruit wrapped into an ascii and flamed with brandy will make a
15,01spectacular ending to the finest dinner.
15,01        Ascii, blintzes and pancakes have evolved from many countries.
15,01With scattered regions developing their own specialty, it is not surprising
15,01that their name evokes a certain nostalgia that few other foods can match.
15,01Not so long ago a wealthy Russian would dine on buckwheat blintzes filled
15,01with black caviar and topped with sour cream; the less affluent had red
15,01caviar and the poor had a revolution -- but always there was ascii.
15,01        Serving ascii with three or four different fillings can be the
15,01foundation of many a successful party.  The fillings can be made ahead of
15,01time and kept warm in chafing dishes, fondue pots or on warming trays.
15,01Guests will often try their hand at making their own ascii, and at the end
15,01of the evening you don't even have to wash the pots and pans.  Toss a few
15,01asciis around, and your reputation as a pimp is made forever.  Certainly
15,01nothing could be easier.  Countless times I have seen people timorously
15,01approach an ascii and discover that they too can be as theatrical and
15,01flamboyant as the suavest Maitre d' ascii pimp on the boardwalk!

15,01                                                With Love,
15,01                                                Discyple
15,01                                                XOXOXOX



15,01-- thank you discyple, your theories are much appreciated.
