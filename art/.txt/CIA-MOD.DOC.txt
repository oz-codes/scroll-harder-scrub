15,01-----[ C!A-MOD v1.03 ]--[06/28/94]-----

15,01  Welcome to CiA-MOD coded and designed by: iCE Breaker of C!A for C!A,
15,01makes sense, huh??? - Anyways, make sure you remove all your memory
15,01managers such as EMM386 or QEMM, they bog your system down and reduce
15,01the probablity of CiA-MOD working properly on your system.

15,01  Please feel free to use and distribute CiA-MOD in it's un-MODified form
15,01(pun intended), including all documentation!  There is no registration
15,01fee for this utility of any kind!  So enjoy, and keep the tunes pumping.

15,01  Hopefully, sooner or later I'll get GUS support in here, but as for now,
15,01it supports just about every SoundBlaster or compatible soundcard.  If
15,01you have any problems with it, please leave tell a CIA representive.
15,01Blah blah blah..  O yea, it might not play LARGE .MOD files over 240k or
15,01so... Tron and I have tested it, and there were only 2-3 .MOD files it
15,01wouldn't play.  With more testing it should be fixed shortly...
