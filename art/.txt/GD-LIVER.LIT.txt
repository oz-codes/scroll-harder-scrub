00,01Liver

00,01The hour has come
00,01It reaches out for you
00,01Razor sharp claws, they cut at you
00,01Lifes desire starts to ebe away
00,01Nothing left, time to pass away

00,01Wicked desires bound you tight
00,01Nothings left for you, lost lives
00,01Young boy reaching for the knives
00,01Wasted youth grown to soon
00,01Not a man not yet soon

00,01Never more only closed doors
00,01Time starts its passing
00,01Oputunities are vanishing
00,01The angels splendid hand
00,01Rests on this cursed land
