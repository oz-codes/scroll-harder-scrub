15,011.   Yes, folks, we're  still in  the scene and  still producing  eye candy to
15,01     make you  dizzy.  Remember to check  the box labeled  "Lord Soth/iCE" for
15,01     the Republican  primaries in a state  near you!   If he doesn't appear on
15,01     your ballot, it was only  because of a  bureaucratic  error,  please give
15,01     him a write-in vote.  Seriously!

15,012.   Numerous  changes to the  memberlist this  month.   We'd like  to welcome
15,01     Kabal 13  to the fold,  an excellent  artist  whose  pictures will  speak
15,01     for themselves.   Kamikazee  comes back with an  ANSI that will  make you
15,01     shiver twice.  Isosceles and  Maestro also return from  places beyond the
15,01     horizon.  We would also like to welcome Snake Grunger, whose ansi talents
15,01     are outstanding.  On a sad note,  Chromatik has left  the scene,  and The
15,01     Green Hornet rejoined DARK.  In this  pack we are releasing  CK's Goodbye
15,01     ansi, entitled "Hello" :)  He did not mean for this to be released in the
15,01     iCE Pack, but we're doing it  as a (sadly) last favor to him.  We want to
15,01     quickly restate  that iCE  does not  wish to alienate  any members of the
15,01     group or discourage any group of people from applying, and that all ideas
15,01     expressed in the pack are the views of the individual artists, and do not
15,01     represent group policy.  Regardless,  we wish both CK and TGH well in all
15,01     their future endeavors.  Finally, due to a violent fever, Magnetic M left
15,01     for Legend, but  once he awoke and  noticed the new  tatoo he returned to
15,01     iCE.  A  cry  of "Who  likes  a  sailor  then?"  went  up  as  the  group
15,01     spontaneously felt bashful.

15,012a.  The staff  would like to  apologize to  Apox for  forgetting  his name in
15,01     the past pack.  Apox, you have one 'kick Syntax in the head' certificate,
15,01     void in 40  states as well as  where prohibited,  except in the case of a
15,01     healthy traumatization.

15,012b.  The staff would  also like to apologize  to Slothy for not announcing his
15,01     official "coming out"  day, on December 22,  1995.  He  proudly wears his
15,01     pink  triangle  in  support  of  ankle  grabbers  around  the world.   We 
15,01     sincerely  regret not making light of  this most important  announcement.

15,013.   Defective  Mind's board,  Black Sunshine,  has  retired.   Apparently the
15,01     software  left a note  on the keyboard  about having  found a  good woman
15,01     in a Waffle House  and leaving for  Tahiti.   Go figure.   In other news,
15,01     nobody else  retired that anyone can think of.   What this has to do with
15,01     iCE  News  has  yet  to  be  seen,   however,  Greater  Evil  was  caught
15,01     "red-handed" as it were during a routine yak molestation.  His court date
15,01     is at noon  on February  17th in the  4th room on  the  left at  the town
15,01     Court.  Everyone  is invited  to Attend.   Oh,  silly me...  he  lives in
15,01     Georgia.   Sheesh,  we   almost  forgot  to  tell   you  where   it  was. 

15,014.   iCE is  back on  FTP,  finally.  The folks at wit.com noticed our defunct
15,01     site during a  reorganization  and contacted  us about  bringing  it back
15,01     online.  While we're  a little slow  doing the  reorganization,  you will
15,01     begin  seeing  the  archives  on  ftp://harmony.wit.com/ice  in the  near
15,01     future.   Bear with  us for a few  weeks while we get  everything running
15,01     smoothly  again and oil all  the gears and  water the plants and blow the
15,01     old air out of the lungs of all the dead bodies.  I think.

15,015.   Just a note  about Surreal Logic's  Web magazine,  NetherwOrld.   This is
15,01     a non-iCE  Affiliated  magazine,  and  we just  wanted to  give him  some
15,01     extra publicity.  The URL for NetherwOrld will be:
15,01     http://deadbaby.res.wpi.edu/nworld/
15,01     It will be  up in about  a week.   Anyone  wanting  to write  an article/
15,01     review packs/do  artwork for the online  magazine should  contact Surreal
15,01     Logic or  his mother,  as she gets  lonely with  nothing to  do except go
15,01     surfing  on the  Baywatch  beach,  although this  requires her  to have a
15,01     weekly disaster  whilst  swimming,  which her  doctor  told her  to watch
