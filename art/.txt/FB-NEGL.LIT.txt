15,01Neglected Life - Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01Lost, confused, relying on the charity of others,.
15,01Getting advice from all my brothers.
15,01Wehere shall I go?  What shall I do?
15,01Lost, all the friends that I once knew.

15,01I gave so much to you, this home of mine,
15,01I have outgrown my worth, I am now past my time.
15,01I helped build you, I fought to keep you free.
15,01To make you a safer place for my children to be.

15,01What has happened to this home of ours?  It falls before our eyes.
15,01The evil ones run with our money, and never answer our "whys".
15,01The future no longer looks bright saws the young and the old,
15,01but there are only a few who want to change and be bold.

15,01Politicians and officials grow wealthy sitting in their seats,
15,01while elderly, homeless, and children die in our streets.
15,01Can you help them?  Can you help me?
15,01Can we bring back hope, to the land of liberty?
