15,01Some sweet talk and a tonne of wine,
15,01They say it works most every time,
15,01To get that chick to hop in bed,
15,01Take it off and spread those legs.

15,01It worked tonight -- you got it on,
15,01You banged on her from dusk till dawn,
15,01But when at last you sobered out,
15,01You saw what you'd been warned about!

15,01You were so drunk you don't know how,
15,01You ever screwed this fucking cow!
15,01This fat, disgusting, lump of shit,
15,01This putrid, pussy, greasy zit.

15,01She wakes and opens yellow eyes,
15,01And holds you tight between her thighs,
15,01She starts to speak, this hairy boar,
15,01"Can't we do it just once more?"
