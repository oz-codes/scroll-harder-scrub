15,01- the innocent child -


15,01I wake into the silent whisper of an elusive morning
15,01as the sun peeks over the
15,01ebony shadow of the hills with the mischievous grin on his face,
15,01like a child peering over the fence and seeing a playful dog on the other side -
15,01a neighbor that just wants to play.
15,01The sun sees me, the insomniac, and his liquid rays speak louder than words
15,01of the resplendence of the dawn.
15,01Languidly, I extol my arms, my bare chest
15,01soaking up the warmth of the sun through a
15,01stained-glass window,
15,01painting a crimson rose on my chest
15,01that falls behind me as I stand and walk away.
15,01The mirror welcomes my waking,
15,01its introspection of myself
15,01speaking back the truth -
15,01I wonder what he thinks of me,
15,01seeing him bare and disheveled through the crystal wall.
15,01I don't care if he sees me - I refuse to be ashamed -
15,01everyone looks the same in the morning - in the pseudo-darkness;
15,01Darkness makes everyone the same.
15,01Still lost in thought, reflex splashes cold water on my face -
15,01the shock comes like standing under a mountain waterfall in dead winter
15,01with only your bare flesh to keep you alive -
15,01the day has that certain nip to it -
15,01the bite that reaches out and pinches your cheek
15,01and says - "Hey, wake up! - there is a world beyond the window
15,01and a life to be lived - come, join the sun on the
15,01hillside and dance with the swaying trees as
15,01they rock in the gentle wind and the splendor of the
15,01crown of autumn, flaunting their colored robes
15,01of leaves in the light of the sun; be alive!"
15,01Who can refuse the invitation?
15,01Barely taking the moment to throw on a shirt, I fling myself at the oaken door
15,01and fall into the wind,
15,01the grass twitching between my toes as I dance on the fertile earth,
15,01wonder in the bountiful bosom of Mother Earth
15,01and love the fruits of her labors -
15,01she guides you as you open your heart to the
15,01song of the clouds and the sapphire sky.
15,01Patterns drift through the vast expanse as the
15,01clouds sing in their own language of shapes and morning-colors -
15,01the silent language of images and imagination
15,01that is heard by every child who has taken the time to spend an afternoon
15,01building an immortal memory as he
15,01dreams away time and confusion,
15,01with his back on a grassy hilltop,
15,01his arms stretched out on the earth,
15,01his body embracing the flows of wind,
15,01and his face turned toward the sun
15,01as he dreams of what might be. . .
15,01For a moment, I become that child again - the only memory of a distant past -
15,01A moment of reprieve amidst the swirling chaos of life -
15,01I am the innocent child again;
15,01The innocent child in eternity.
