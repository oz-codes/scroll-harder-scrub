00,01Oh, great poets of wrath,
00,01Do not fear...
00,01For the coming of rising serpent
00,01Is near.

00,01Though all of your moments of glory
00,01Have extinguished in the not too distant past,
00,01Your protrusion into darkness cuts like a knife...
00,01At the moonbeam's pass,
00,01I travel last-

00,01I at my study, examined the distant fire light,
00,01Yet all stand too sturdy, and none too bright...
00,01That I could see into the waking past...
00,01And grap what fires are burning fast,
00,01Into the night and bye the sun,
00,01What is accomplished is hardly done...
00,01But yet, I have a feeling flying low,
00,01That the great jaws of the serpent
00,01Will fill their toll-
