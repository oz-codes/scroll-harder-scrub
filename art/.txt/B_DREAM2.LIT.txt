15,01                          "Good-night," i said to the Priest
15,01                                "Good Night," he said

15,01        A secret formula that sucks peoples souls from the pit of their 
15,01stomach to be stung by the metallic air is clasped in the hands of a maniac 
15,01doctor who hovers over me silently like a big bug his eyes are wide and 
15,01whirling in his head as he holds a needle bright and sharp to a vulnerable 
15,01spot at the base of my neck where the bones appear and reappear because my 
15,01breath is coming harsh from fear of the needle as it pushes alien and cold 
15,01into my veins this fear i have she says as she pushes a few strands of her 
15,01hair over her ears her fingers are clumsy and do very little but the light 
15,01catches a faint gleam at the top of her head this fear of being like the 
15,01people that i hate so much her words are tinged with sarcastic laughter but 
15,01her eyes tell a different story they are bloodshot and they replay the 
15,01nightmares like dogs dogs with yellow teeth coated with saliva that snap at 
15,01the back of my ankles just nipping the skin the dogs eyes are wide and white 
15,01and remind me of her smile and how it makes her face glow with not a childlike 
15,01light but a welcoming light and i catch myself thinking of her back again and 
15,01how it rises up and down with each breath she takes her shirt only slightly 
15,01warm where it soaked in her body heat but i have to stop thinking of that now 
15,01because she is talking again and i am mesmerized by the fears she places in my 
15,01hands and how they curl around my body rustling against me with dangerous 
15,01eroticism but i have to be careful now because the black smoothness of them 
15,01has entered my skin and has pushed it's way into me i am choking as it slides 
15,01down my throat and into my stomach where it is pulling at my soul and sinking 
15,01it's teeth into it i can feel it bleeding but i can't let it or the doctor or 
15,01the girl or the old man with the nazi in his eyes tell me what to do or who 
15,01to be or what colored nose to wear...

15,01        "Come," said the captain, "we go to whorehouse before it shuts"
15,01                        "He should go to Palerma"
15,01"It is a filthy and vile book," said the Priest, "You do not really like it?"
