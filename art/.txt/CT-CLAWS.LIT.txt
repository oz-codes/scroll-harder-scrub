15,01I should have been a pair of ragged claws
15,01scuttling across the floor of silent seas
15,01so far beneath the simple surface laws
15,01that life spins out, ignoring nature's pleas.

15,01Two wingtips tracing lines across the skies,
15,01potential realized now in three planes.
15,01My grave dsecent left burned in mortals' eyes.
15,01Their loss of sight exchanged for fallen gains.

15,01The claws burst into flame - quite blue and hot
15,01while feathers penetrate into soft loam.
15,01Those seemly ends will quickly be forgot.

15,01I brought to mind all four beneath the dome.
15,01The poles are brought together in their end,
15,01and only in destruction can they mend.
