15,01+-----------------------.. .  .

15,01            Hello  everyone  and welcome to the  first edition of the
15,01         Imperial art package.  This  has  been a very  hectic  month
15,01         organizing this newly merged group.  It  took a while to get
15,01         linked up, and to  think  up of a name, but as you can tell,
15,01         everything is going great.


15,01                                                 .  . ..---------------------+

15,01                                  The Merger

15,01            The  two groups  that formed Imperial were  Grip (Graphic
15,01         Revolution in Proccess) and Nwa (New Wave Artists).  Both me
15,01         (The Narccissist) and The Night Prowler both decided that we
15,01         both run good art groups,  but things were missing.  Both of
15,01         our respected groups had  stronger areas then the other, and
15,01         it only seemed right that we combine all our  talent to make
15,01         a better group.  Instead of  running two rival  groups we've
15,01         decided to work together and do the best we can to make this
15,01         group a big success.  For  the first few days we settled the
15,01         decisions about  positions and  sites,  and how we'd run the
15,01         group, who would do what etc., but  the longest  decision to
15,01         decide was the name, there were many suggestions, and at one
15,01         time  we  had decided to use the name Domination,  but since
15,01         the artists  weren't too happy about it,  we  decided on the
15,01         name Imperial, a name which was suggested by Zorlak, and I'm
15,01         glad we finally decided!

15,01            Another  key  part of the merger were the two main  areas
15,01         where the groups were located.  Nwa was  an  art group  that
15,01         was based in western Canada, with sites around North America
15,01         but all our  artists in 604 (British Columbia).  Grip seemed
15,01         that is was mainly based in  the east,  Montreal to be exact
15,01         (514).  This  seemed to  be like the perfect east meets west
15,01         merger, bringing both sides of Canada together.

15,01            I'm  not  sure  if there  will be any other major mergers
15,01         for the group, and with  The Night Prowler I  think we  will
15,01         do  the best for the group.  In working with TNP, I've found
15,01         that not  only is he a very great ansi artist and coder, but
15,01         he is also a great person.  Easy going  and easy to talk to,
15,01         and he also runs Never Land,  a board with the best Renegade
15,01         setup I've ever seen.  I take my hat off to TNP.

15,01+-----------------------.. .  .

15,01                                   Lastly =]

15,01            This is just the first of what I estimate to be very many
15,01         art packages.  We were kinda shaky  getting this one off the
15,01         ground,  but  I'm sure in the months to come that we will be
15,01         able to produce even more quality work.

15,01            I'd like to take  this time to send out special greets to
15,01         The Night Prowler,  Six Pack  for  keeping  in touch with me
15,01         while the merger was going through,  The Masked Pirate,  who
15,01         likes to stay modest although he's one of the best we've got
15,01         and to all former Nwa and Grip members, I'm glad that we are
15,01         all together and producing quality artwork.

15,01            And finally,  I'd like to ask you all to read COBAIN.ANS,
15,01         it is something I  wrote in the memory  of my favorite music
15,01         artist,  who commited  suicide in early/mid  April.  Nirvana
15,01         will always be No.1 in my mind.
