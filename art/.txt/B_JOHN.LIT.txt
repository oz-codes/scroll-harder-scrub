00,01O15nce There was a man named Johnny McGill,
00,01H15e thought the world was round and probably does still.
00,01O15ne day he decided to walk out of town,
00,01H15e thought if he kept going that he'd come back around.
00,01H15e walked and he walked, he walked all the night.
00,01J15ohn couldn't be wrong he knew he was right.
00,01J15ohnny, Oh Johnny.
00,01J15ohnny, Johnny McGill.

00,01W15ell, he came to this place, the deep, blue ocean.
00,01J15ohnny bought a boat, he sailed with devotion.
00,01H15e sailed and he sailed, he sailed all the way.
00,01"15The world is round, I'll make it!" he'd say.
00,01O15ne day this big fish crossed Johnny path.
00,01T15he fish took a bite and John took a bath.
00,01T15he fish was a whale and it wanted some sup.
00,01I15t swallowed John whole and spat him back up.

00,01W15ell, he landed on the beach of a great new green land.
00,01H15e clambered up a mountain and raised his great hand.
00,01"15Look, I've come to this land, it's solid, it's pat
00,01I15've proved to you all the world is not flat!"
00,01W15ell, he kept on going, he wished to go home.
00,01Y15ou know that place where the buffalo roam.

00,01W15ell, he kept on going but unknown to him,
00,01T15he edge was near his future looked grim.
00,01H15e tripped and fell and landed splat,
00,01T15he world was not round it was flat FLAT FLAT!

00,01I15f you take this trip, you must be unglued.
00,01'15Cause when you reach the end you will be screwed.
