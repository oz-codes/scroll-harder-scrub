15,01Lit Beef - by Frost Byte <CiA Lit SS>

15,01 Well, again it has come to ripping on literature in the scene. 
15,01Sure, I guess that it is easy to get a lit affiliation with a
15,01group. No really, if there is NO quality control, I guess that
15,01you can let anyone in and lit can look, and sound like shit.  Any
15,01schmuck that doodles a few words down on a piece of paper and
15,01types it in, ta-da.  They just became a lit artist. Congratula-
15,01tions, you just have moved into the scene, a few key words, a
15,01little arrangement, and you too can become a upstanding member of
15,01the art society.  Then again, take a look at some of the more
15,01respected literature groups out there, look at their membership
15,01listings, gee whiz, you would think that with how EASY it is
15,01there would be members flowing out their wazoo's.  NO?  There is
15,01not 300 lit members in any lit group?  Well, now there is a surprise,
15,01No? 
15,01 With a little quality control, you can get the decent lit
15,01artists, not every Tom, Dick or Harry can show up on the scene
15,01and do good lits.  In all actuality, look at the number of
15,01practicing artists, and look at the number of practicing lit
15,01artists.  There are less lit artists than ANSi artists. That does
15,01not even take into account the GOOD lit artists from the BAD lit
15,01artists.
15,01 If you let every handle that can write a few words down into a
15,01group. Why not let every person with a copy of TheDraw, ACiDDraw,
15,01AnsiAnimatior, Rage, Debut, or Warlock into an ANSi group?  It really is
15,01not comparing apples to oranges anymore.  LIT IS ART.  You want apples
15,01and oranges, hit a fruit stand shmuck.
