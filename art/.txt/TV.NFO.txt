15,01[<--------------------------- TorrentView v1.0a ---------------------------->]

15,01                      You know the whole disclaimer bit. 

15,01      You know i don't want this program distro'd without prior consent.

15,01                          You know all that bullshit

15,01  What i want you to know is that this program is not a very good example of
15,01  my coding abilities or of the torrent coding division (of which i am the
15,01  sole proprietor). It's absolutely loaded with flaws and bugs. The only
15,01  reason i'm releasing it is because you _can_ scroll through your files,
15,01  you _can_ view jpg's and gif's, and we wanted a viewer for pack#1. The gif
15,01  viewing is top notch, but the jpg viewing is lacking in speed, resolution
15,01  optimization, and dithering. Excuse the quality of this program for now.
15,01  Next month it'll knock your socks off. =)
