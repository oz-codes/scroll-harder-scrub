15,01A child touches the stove in innocence only to get burned
15,01I reach for the impossible (the ideal) for which I've always yearned

15,01the vernacular states three times the charm
15,01two times I've tried both resulting in harm

15,01two visions already fill my mind
15,01I pray the third I never find

15,01the fire within burns ever stronger
15,01How can I take it even longer

15,01Some call it a crush it's a fitting word
15,01My feelings best described using crushed as a verb

15,01I used to think of suicide
15,01and all to often I have cried

15,01The anger has always been inside
15,01To control it each day I've tried

15,01The body I am given is truly a sight
15,01Dark hair and eyes, only me mind is bright

15,01some say "I have a beautiful mind", this I'll never claim
15,01The ever growing wide range of thoughts
15,01love, hate, sorrow, joy, unknown, and fame
15,01they are constantly changing only me to blame

15,01Living this barren life
15,01Every inch of joy cut short by the scythe
15,01of reality

15,01I need more
