15,01next step.

15,01counting the days one by one
15,01thinking of a life born without fun
15,01lost inside a dream of the inner sun
15,01but now gone because of what youve done

15,01i counted to three before i left
15,01broken by a counter rapped by theft
15,01still going on just to see whats left
15,01maybe i'm curious or maybe i want the gift

15,01towering over rendering sleep
15,01losing the thought i dare not keep
15,01torn asunder by those who are cheep
15,01and your glory is what they reep

15,01but i'm still curious and still enchanted
15,01wonderin of the things born implanted
15,01can i not find the world not intrenched
15,01find where the missing link has doubled

15,01or will i walk the way to my final stay
15,01in one resting place on my final day
15,01where the sun wont shine and the dogs wont bay
15,01turning slowly to sand inside my box i'll stay.

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
