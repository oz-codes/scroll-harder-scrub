15,01                                   Welcome!               
15,01                                   
15,01           Hello guys and gals (and Tzeentchs  =]) and I hope you have          
15,01         
15,01        enjoyed (or at least, will enjoy) the third installment of the          
15,01 
15,01        Imperial art package.  This has been our busiest, toughest and
15,01        bumpiest month.  People have come and gone, and some have come
15,01        back,  but all in all,  I  think the group  has again improved 
15,01        since the last pack,  first,  let's get on to the  new members
15,01        and the departures.                               
15,01                                                 .  . ..---------------------+
15,01                               The 'Big Three'

15,01           The day after Imp-0494.Zip was released, 3 members had sent
15,01        me  their  resignation forms.  Asian Knight and  Darkforce was
15,01        headed  for Tribe  and Vanquish off to Nation, but about a few
15,01        weeks later, two  of  them were not in their groups, Darkforce
15,01        and  Asian  Knight were both out of Tribe.  Darkforce  went to
15,01        Union, and Asian Knight re-joined the Imperial family,  and it
15,01        is  great to have him back.  You  will see the  last  Imperial
15,01        works from  Vanquish  in  this months pack, and well, with the 
15,01        new work by Asian Knight, you'll never think he left =]

15,01           The  new artists.  Alot of people applied for Imperial this
15,01        month, and alot of them are  talented. Some of our new members
15,01        are Devil's Spawn from iCE, Maximum Overdose, The Drowning Man
15,01        Reznor from various art groups, and a few other guys, who look
15,01        very promising. Mr. Wizard, a talented artist, and a few other
15,01        applicants are being reviewed. Bravo.

15,01           From my local area code,  604 (HOME  OF THE CANUCKS!) there
15,01        rose two new members, Eternal Silence, who has a great deal of
15,01        potential, and Grateful Dead, who used to be 604's most wanted
15,01        man, but quit the scene a  while back,  well he's back. I look
15,01        back on the days Pain (my old group) and (Poison, we merged to
15,01        make NWA)  were both  fighting over GD,  well, looks like BOTH
15,01        sides won =]

15,01                                   
15,01           Well, you may see in the  future other mergers with our us
15,01        and other groups, but Six Pack,  Night Prowler and I will all
15,01        have to discuss anything, but  we got a STRONG group starting
15,01        here, and well,  we're already  solid enough, but it would be
15,01        nice, if the group was good.
15,01                                          Till next time,
15,01                                                The Narccissist of Imperial
