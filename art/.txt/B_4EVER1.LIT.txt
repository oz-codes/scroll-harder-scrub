15,01# Words by Beatle

15,01I hear the pictures in the music
15,01I see the sounds in the painting
15,01I hear the writing on the wall
15,01I see the words that you speak

15,01I've been here longer then you think
15,01I've been known more than you'll know
15,01I've seen more than you'll see
15,01I've heard more then you'll hear

15,01Writing down the sounds she hears
15,01Touch the music in the air
15,01Singing to the painting
15,01Drawing pictures with her voice

15,01I see her thoughts in the moonlight
15,01Feel her voice in the darkness
15,01Watch her dreams as she sleeps
15,01Hold her soul in my hand

15,01I've witnessed the birth of the Universe
15,01I've witnessed the birth of Time
15,01I've witnessed the birth of Life
15,01But I'll never witness mine

15,01The painting is unfinished
15,01The symphony is undone
15,01The painting is unfinished
15,01The symphony in undone

15,01I'll be here longer than you think
15,01I'll know more then you'll know
15,01I'll see more than you'll see
15,01I'll hear more than you'll hear
