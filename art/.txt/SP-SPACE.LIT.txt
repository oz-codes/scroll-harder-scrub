15,01Space is an endless frontier
15,01into which we must venture
15,01There we may find the answers
15,01to the questions which plague us today
15,01Hunger, disease, homelessness, war;
15,01all problems which we must soon confront
15,01And in the sky far above
15,01we can learn of ourselves
15,01Not just of other species
15,01we must learn from them what we must do
15,01In order to save ourselves
15,01from the ultimate destruction
15,01Which lies before us

15,01Stop- why must we escape
15,01to other worlds
15,01To find answers?
15,01we can solve them here, at home
15,01If only we set our minds to it
15,01great thinkers of the world must unite
15,01For a common cause
15,01greater then all of their work together:
15,01The saving of the planet Earth!
