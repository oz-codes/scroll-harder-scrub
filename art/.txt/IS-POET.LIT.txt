00,01The poet to the reader....

13,01My th06ought14s don't flow so smoothly as I sit down to write.
13,01I los06e a l14ittle word or phrase along the way and the poesy diminishes.

13,01Life 06is li14mited, exceedingly so, not by the restraints,
13,01Of de06ath, 14but by the restraints of humanity.

13,01I am 06facet14ious.  I never show my true face, hidden by a masque of cold words.

13,01I am 06lost 14in my sentiments, failed interpretations of
13,01Prett06y sou14nding words strung together from the bottom of my heart.

13,01I sha06ll no14t wax poetic, nor shall I bore you with observations
13,01Of na06ture 14and laments of a hard life.

13,01The e06ssenc14e of the poem escapes me, as they are just words, empty words.
13,01Yet t06hey s14eem to affect, as they create the desired image that
13,01The p06oet w14ishes to bring to his perpetual audience,
13,01Thusl06y cre14ating a lifetime of remembrance.
