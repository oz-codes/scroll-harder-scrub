00,01If I when the teacher is not looking

00,01and writing on the blackboard

00,01and all of my classmates watch me

00,01as I reveal my butt to them

00,01- TWO MOONS SHINING

00,01in the light of an afternoon sun

00,01They will laugh and the teacher

00,01may turn around only to see

00,01my defiant middle finger aimed directly at him

00,01while my two moons are still glowing brightly

00,01Who shall say I am not the hero of the school?
