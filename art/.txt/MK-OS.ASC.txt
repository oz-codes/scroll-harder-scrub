15,01It's your old friend Mr Kite.  I was arguing the other day on how
15,01uninspiring and commercial the ascii scene is now.  All anyone does
15,01is fucking fonts.  The opposition (names withheld) said that it's because
15,01the oldschool medium is more restrictive than newschool.  To that I say
15,01be fucking creative.  You're artists, you're supposed to find ways express
15,01yourself using what's at hand. You could draw an interesting picture using
15,01only the character "@", so fuck that idea.  Now this is my first attempt
15,01at oldschool.. and while it's a little plain, it's a start.  I might draw
15,01another... but I won't take requests, since I don't do commercials.
