15,01I have a mickey in my pocket...
15,01          it's filled with despair
15,01                 I'm afraid if I open the top
15,01my life will change....but for the worst?
15,01the head is melting
15,01          my body heat is slowly melting it
15,01               shapes appear and dissappear
15,01                    new forms.
15,01               is the head of wax ?
15,01          feels like it.
15,01               and it melts...
15,01                    and little bits of dispair escape.
15,01                         and fly around like flies.
15,01          but I have my fly swatter

15,01 I will not be my own Pandora
15,01 letting the contents of my darker self escape
15,01                   and
15,01                   destroy me.
15,01                                  Why did I carry them so close to me?
15,01never letting them see the light of day......
15,01but sure enough..
15,01          sure enough.
15,01               sire.
15,01               these flies keeping pestering us .. whatever shall we do ?
15,01          return fire admiral. keep the flies at bay.
15,01        <sounds from the battlefield>
15,01    a man. Robert Ross. leading the flies. saving them. something inside is s,
15,01within our own ranks , is saving the flies of dispair.
15,01     is he a hero ? is he wrong ?
15,01     maybe those flies are a part of us. they make us whole. maybe.

15,01And now I am flying.....
15,01    a new me....perhaps newer than you think....
15,01returns triumphant from the field, my fly swatter snapped to smart attention.

15,01            b  u t   yes?
15,01we all know Ross dies in the end.
15,01after a hopeless relationship.
15,01after being brutally raped.
15,01he burns. burns. and
15,01well... was he a hero ?
