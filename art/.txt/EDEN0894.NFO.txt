15,01Okay Guys and Gals, here is the Eden 08/94 NFO file as typed by Dalamar, with
15,01submissions by other members.

15,01 12The Formation of15       To begin with, it's important for me to give you an

15,01 14mmmmmmmmm15 14mmm15 14m15    had decided to make an art group, named Rancid. We ran
15,01                    Rancid for about eight months or so, but we were not very
15,01 happy with Rancid, since the group was not run efficiently, so rather than
15,01 clean it up ourselves, we left the group to MindCrime, who turned it into the
15,01 now Blade. We decided it was best to leave the scene for a while, and work 
15,01 on our various talents. Me (Dalamar) on Art, and Temperate Hijacker on coding. 
15,01 After around six or so more months, we decided we were ready to begin a new
15,01 group, and Eden was born.
15,01       Basically, the logic around why we formed Eden, was that we wanted to 
15,01 create a group who was not worried about it's size, or weather or nor it was
15,01 in the top five, but rather to be the best it could be, and put out quality.
15,01 This is the group's motto, "Quality over Quantity". It is because of this that 
15,01 we are putting out a pack with so few members. We believe the team we have put 
15,01 together is capable of producing quality. The other factor we want to emphasize
15,01 is that we are about having fun. We enforce no restriction on the number of
15,01 ansis, lit, etc... that you produce. If you are a member, that is that, you
15,01 produce if you want to, if you don't, oh well. The theory is that if you do
15,01 your best work in a laid-back relaxed manner, not in a harried rushed one. Art 
15,01 is to enjoy making and having fun with, and that is what we intend.
15,01       So with our philosophies in order, we recruited a talented lit guy named 
15,01 Crisis and made him lit coordinator. We also managed to grab Ex-CIA guy 
15,01 Mr. Data, who I might add is a superb coder (Hence, we include PPEs in the 
15,01 pack). And although we have only one artist for now, we feel that the laid
15,01 back manner of the group, coupled with the quality releases, will attract the
15,01 highest caliber of artist. And as such, we are looking for VGA and RIP
15,01 coordinators. Well, to sum everything up, have fun with the pack and if you
15,01 don't like it, call Syndication-X and leave feedback to the presidents on why
15,01 you don't like it and what you would change. In short, have fun and peace!
