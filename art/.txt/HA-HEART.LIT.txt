15,01              00T13h06e14re is someone  in my life that I love very much,
15,01              00M13y 06h14eart longs to feel, her sweet and gentle touch.
15,01           00T13h06i14s girl is like a princess to me,  but who am I to say?
15,01              00W13o06r14ds can't describe how  I feel for her every day.
15,01                 00E13v06e14rytime I see her, it makes me want to cry,
15,01             00M13y 06h14eart gets knotted up; into a knot  I can't untie.
15,01         00S13o06o14n we'll be out of  high school and I will see her no more,
15,01             00U13n06t14il then, love and happiness is what I'll look for.
15,01                  00I 13w06r14ote this for her, from my lonely heart,
15,01               00W13h06i14ch is hurting me badly, it's ripping me apart.
15,01               00W13h06a14t will happen between us, is  anybody's guess,
15,01            00B13u06t 14all I can say for now, is she leaves  me heartless.
