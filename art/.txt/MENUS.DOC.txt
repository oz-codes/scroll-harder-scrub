15,01INTRODUCTION:

15,01    Celerity is a great software.  It's features are numerous and it's flex-
15,01ibility is limitless.  It's only drawback is it's complexity.  There are many
15,01aspects of Celerity that take a lot of time to understand and impliment.  
15,01Language files and menu files provide a great wealth of options in configuring
15,01your system, and are capable of making your system look like almost anything.

15,01    These menus are fairly simple, yet great looking.  They will give you one
15,01less thing to worry about when setting up your system.

15,01INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING:

15,011.  Look at the menus (all entries in this zip as xxxx.) and see if you
15,01    like them.

15,012.  Copy the menus that you wish to use (and i suggest you use all of them)
15,01    to the directory listed in line 2 of EDITLANG.DAT

15,013.  Run EDITLANG.EXE.

15,014.  Select what menufile you would like to put these menus in from the

15,01    *WARNING*  If you deccide to import these menus into an EXISTING menufile
15,01               they will overwrite your existing menus.  I recommend making
