15,01toy train, its tracks hooked onto the ceiling
15,01a drunk Spaniard, messing up her seduction, asks me for the joint
15,01I wish I had.
15,01by the end of the reading, each hair on the girl's head tilted in front of me
15,01will have passed between my fingers.

15,01there is a rain stick on stage,
15,01the snare drummer tips it upside down,
15,01downside up; where did it start, and when?

15,01Leonard doesn't tell; he refuses 
15,01me the finality of an answer.

15,01I must listen hard enough
15,01to bounce the train off its line,
15,01return the girl's hair to every lost touch
15,01so I can lose possession,
15,01derail those causes dropping me off here

15,01applauding a man sharing the same 
15,01time zone as me,
15,01and another, maybe in Greece or Montreal,
15,01flattering women with a stethoscope
15,01tuned to his heart.
