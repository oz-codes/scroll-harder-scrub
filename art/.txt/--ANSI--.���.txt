15,01Yoda by Weird Al Yankovic from Dare to be Stupid! 

15,01I met him in a swamp down in Dagoba,
15,01Where it bubbles all the time like a giant carbonated soda.
15,01S-O-D-A, soda.
15,01I saw the little runt sitting there on a log.
15,01I asked him his name, and in a raspy voice he said, "Yoda."
15,01Y-O-D-A, Yo-ho-da.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Well, I've been around, but I ain't never seen
15,01A guy who looks like a muppet, but he's wrinkled and green.
15,01Oh, my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Well, I'm not dumb, but I can't understand
15,01How he can lift me in the air just by raising his hand.
15,01Oh, my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Well, I left home just a week before,
15,01And I've never ever been a Jedi before.
15,01But Obi Wan, he set me straight, of course.
15,01He said, "Go to Yoda and he'll show you the Force!"

15,01Well I'm not the kind that would argue with Ben,
15,01So it looks like I'm gonna start all over again
15,01O with my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01So I used the Force.
15,01I picked up a box.
15,01I lifted some rocks
15,01While I stood on my head.
15,01Well, I won't forget what Yoda said.

15,01He said, "Luke, stay away from the Darker Side,
15,01And if you start to go astray, let the Force be your guide."
15,01Oh, my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01"I know Darth Vader's really got you annoyed,
15,01But remember, if you kill him then you'll be unemployed."
15,01Oh, my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Well, I heard my friends really got in a mess,
15,01So I'm gonna have to leave Yoda, I guess.
15,01But I know that I'll be coming back some day.
15,01I'll be playing this part till I'm old and gray.
15,01The long-term contract that I had to sign
15,01Says I'll be making these movies till the end of time,
15,01O with my Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.

15,01Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
15,01Yo Yo Yo Yo Yoda.
