15,01Sandy Blue Eyes


15,01Sandy blue eyes,
15,01Give a little hope to a blind man,
15,01Always so sad...
15,01I grieve-

15,01My nervous system is erect,
15,01The sun peaks through the clouds,
15,01All your pain and suffering is
15,01  not in vain...-

15,01To see those blue eyes
15,01Close up with tears,
15,01All this death you could not
15,01  hide,
15,01It's eating you up inside-

15,01I remember the day we met,
15,01Oh, what a fair sister that fell to
15,01  the threasher's flail,
15,01And all those tears that came from
15,01  that blue heaven,
15,01So bloodshot, so dead,
15,01And all I could say is that I was sorry,
15,01All I can say is that I am sorry-

15,01You were always stronger than I,
15,01Any lesser of a human being would of
15,01  died,
15,01This I know to be true,
15,01Deep in my heart I still love you-

15,01And when the summer of our delusions
15,01Turns into the fall of our passing,
15,01And the cold air blows down from the
15,01  north,
15,01And every leave on every tree crumbles
15,01  to the ground,
15,01I will look up to a blue sky,
15,01Your eyes
15,01Filled with tears-
