00,01The evil is calling
00,01Despite what they say
00,01The good guys are falling
00,01By night and by day

00,01The devil is creeping
00,01Right into your bed
00,01And when you are sleeping,
00,01it's him in your head

00,01The shadows are casting
00,01Get ready to die
00,01The darkness is lasting
00,01Its not worth the try

00,01The silence disturbs you
00,01though quiet at last
00,01your wishes were not true
00,01But the worst part has past

00,01With silence and darkness
00,01and noone around
00,01You come to your senses
00,01you are under the ground

00,01You lie there for hours
00,01for water you thrive
00,01with aroma of flowers
00,01you were buried alive
