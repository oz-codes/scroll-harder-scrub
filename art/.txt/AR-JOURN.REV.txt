15,01journey

15,01a bell tolls distant, wearily
15,01encompassing a dreary thee
15,01a fog rolls in, and out again as though a mystery
15,01a path has formed, below your feet
15,01what once was air, is now a street
15,01you step along, with no intent of fate you soon shall meet
15,01a ponder here, a ponder there
15,01thoughts lie weeping everywhere
15,01"What a dream," you think aloud,"as cold as yonder air!"
15,01'tis no dream, you realize
15,01unto the mind, it deifies
15,01caught in a trance, you send a selfish mind its wasted lies
15,01here you'll remain
15,01no loss, no gain
15,01and so once more, your trapped in fear, afraid to face the pain.
