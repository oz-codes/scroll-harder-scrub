15,01Pick it, pack it, fire it up.
15,01Come along and take a hit from the bong.
15,01Put the blunt down just for a second,
15,01Don't get me wrong it's not a new method.
15,01Inhale ..... exhale.... Just got an ounce in the mail
15,01I like a blunt or a big fat cone ,
15,01but my double barreled bong is a getting me stoned
15,01I'm skillin', just wanna run inside, don't spill it.
15,01Smells like shit on the carpet, swill it.
15,01Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit,
15,01of the skunky funky smelly green shit
15,01Sing my song, puff all night long...
15,01And so take hits from the Bong....

15,01I LOVE YOU MARY JANE....
15,01She never complains when I get merry,
15,01With that flame, I light up the cherry.
15,01She's so good to me,
15,01when I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
15,01Don't get me started up, I smoke through the bubbling water,
15,01Makin' it pure so I's gots 'ta .
15,01Take my hand and hold it, just like CHONG, I get the bowl,
