15,01                    - Introspection -



15,01My soul is drowned in the memories that follow with the rain,
15,01And sear the immortal heart with regret and pain,
15,01And draw the weary lid of the coffin of time,
15,01And strive to bury my heart upon the open bed of pine.

15,01I sink into lament like a stone into a stream,
15,01And in comatose silence, I stare in space and dream,
15,01And all the mortal fury that once burned me deep inside,
15,01Now finds a hiding place in the endless caverns of the mind.

15,01And all that is or was in being,
15,01Escapes this hell like dawn-knights fleeing,
15,01And leaves us alone with out own condemnation,
15,01And spills the regret that will be out eternal damnation.
