15,01                     By - Who do you think dumbass?!


15,01        Howdy cowboys and cowgirls <they had rodeo week here a couple
15,01weekends ago, and I'm still recovering>! This month pretty much sucked.  At
15,01least for me, during this wonderful Rodeo week we had, I rear-ended some
15,01old man driving a tank..err.. an el camino.  Caused $3100 in damage to my
15,01front end, and left a mark of paint on his bumper.  At least he didn't go
15,01into fits of eppeleptic seizures(sp).  Anyways.. oh, this is the ALIVE
15,01article.. that's right.

15,01        Publicity for us -

15,01                This month we had a corruption #3 article lined up, but
15,01        when psyco child lost his 800, I lost the time to call. <grin>
15,01        So the official corruption #3 article on the alive history - is now
15,01        the official corruption #4 article.
15,01                Iridium article as well was planned - but I finish writing
15,01        the sucker and I call ShadowLands.. can't connect all of a sudden.
15,01        Then, I try the next day - line's disconnected.  Anyone know what's
15,01        going on over there?  If someone wants to call up my board and
15,01        get the two articles... feel free.

15,01        New Members -

15,01                This month saw the welcomed addition of a few new members.
15,01        First off was Illusive Criminal's complete welcome in, from a
15,01        somewhat sketchy standing last month.  Next, Biscuit, a previous
15,01        no-name has joined us - and he's great.  This dude will turn some
15,01        heads, so keep an eye on him.  But of course, Einstein.  One day, I
15,01        was cruising my local VBBS board, on VNET, and of course on 'ANSI
15,01        ELITE'<is that a paradox or irony or what?> when I see EN posting
15,01        that he isn't going to join the union/empire merger.  Hmph, I think.
15,01        So I sift through an old empire pack for a board number or two.  I
15,01        call up Straight No Chaser on accident - PsycoTrane's board and ask
15,01        for a voice.  No go, but I do have Falling Fast's number, EN's own
15,01        board.  Called it up, left him email, he joined alive.  In the
15,01        process, PsycoTrane, previously of empire, told me that he wasn't
15,01        going to union either.
15,01                [ed. note: why was empire so anti-union?  not that i'm
15,01                complaining, but it's interesting, that's all.]

15,01        Soon, PT calls my board, u/ls an application, and is a member.
15,01        Cool, a lit guy, now we can have some 'multi-media' productions,
15,01        graphics AND literary prowess. =)

15,01                The other thing this month - was the re-establishment of
15,01        contact with Mr. Sinister [ours, not the ex-tribe one..] and picking
15,01        up one of his works.  It's for Legion of Silence, which has overall
15,01        dropped out of contact with us, but nonetheless, it's for you SD.


15,01        New Site for 6/94 -

15,01                Well, last month I said that sites were going out to friends
15,01        on an invite only basis.  Ok maybe not.  I forgot we only had two
15,01        canadian boards, and RipTide, of Nation, called me up with a
15,01        application.  We talked, and I decided it would be good to pick up
15,01        one last canadian site.  MaelStrom, in 905, is now an alive board.
15,01        We regretfully inform the public that we've dropped Sushi Bar Z.
15,01        What happened to this guy?  Did he fall of the edge of the planet?
15,01        Sushmeister - you were like our very FIRST site, and we haven't
15,01        heard from you in 6 months... did you get shot in compton or..?
15,01        If Sushi X reads this, and is still interested in an alive site,
15,01        he can call up PR and chat with me on the issue and we'll work
15,01        something back out.
15,01                There is also a certain board, run by a certain sysop, in
15,01        a certain ac like 413, who happens to be a nation whq, and who
15,01        would like to think he's an alive site.  Too bad this sucker hasn't
15,01        called me back. =) Now by the chance that he does call me back,
15,01        perhaps such things as him being added to the site list could happen.
15,01        To Hammer in 413 - Sorry man, I have to do what I promised first. =(


15,01        Requests during 6/94 -

15,01                ALiVE has a request to put out.  I recently have aquired an
15,01        account on the internet via Delphi. <oh joy ren.> And I'm now a
