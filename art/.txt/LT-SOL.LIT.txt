00,01 I look out my window and see
00,01so many faces staring at me
00,01 I live in complete poverty
00,01and my country says I'm free
00,01 My brothers were jailed for speaking out
00,01all the injustice makes me scream and shout
00,01 Their wealth perpetuates the strife
00,01how can they tell me how to live my life
00,01 How can they tell me how to live my life

00,01all the injustice, all the cries
00,01 All the children killed, all the fucking lies
00,01no questions asked, why is this so
00,01 People bound in chains, justice is so slow

00,01so many hungry mouths to feed
00,01 Hungry because of their frightening greed
00,01so many people living in need
00,01 Will we ever be freed
00,01will we ever be freed

00,01 Stop the oppresion, stop the lies
00,01stop the needless death and the children's cries
00,01 A world of hate destroying lives
00,01can't you see we've got to fight

00,01 Solidarity !!!!!
