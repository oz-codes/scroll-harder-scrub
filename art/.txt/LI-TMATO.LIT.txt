15,01The Screaming Tomato
15,01--------------------

15,01Tuny confronted his mother, shaking slightly...
15,01"Mother, is it true?  Am I not a full-blooded beefsteak tomato?

15,01"Am I a bastard?"

15,01Tuny's shiny red mother tried her best to comfort him, then admitted,
15,01"Yes, dear.  Your father was a potato."

15,01"But... i thought a potato was a starchy white tuber, while a tomato
15,01is a pulpy berry-like fruit...?"

15,01"Well, that's true..."

15,01"Then how...?"

15,01"I don't know, look it up in Webster's dictionary."

15,01Tuny was horrified to find out that he was, in fact, related to the
15,01potato.  He quickly packed his things, with only one thought in mind:

15,01He must kill the potato.

15,01So, despite his mother's pleadings and ketchup tears, he stormed out
15,01of the house.

15,01He bought a ticket forthe next available train for Idaho, and
15,01gathering his vegetable peeler and julienne cutter, he boarded the
15,01train.

15,01Idaho came quickly, and he began his long search for the potato which
15,01had defiled his family's bloodline.

15,01Rumours of the existence of a potato which had left behind a wife and
15,01a seedling soon led him to a small farm near the southern border.

15,01Confronting each of the potatoes in turn, he finally found the
15,01offending potato.

15,01To his disappointment, the potato had grown old.  Its eyes were
15,01stretched out over several feet and it was almost dead.

15,01Readying the peeler, he stepped forward and demanded, "Why?"

15,01The old potato stirred, waited a few seconds, and then replied,
15,01"You may not believe this, boy, but I really loved your mother.

15,01"I left because I knew how tough it would be for you, going to school
15,01with all the other tomatoes.  You'd have been pureed by the other
15,01tomatoes just for being a half-breed.  I left because I cared."

15,01Not buying this feeble emotional crap, Tuny chopped the elderly
15,01tuber into hash browns.

15,01"You're not my father!"  he screamed.

15,01And so, with his father properly julienned, Tuny set out for the
15,01library, to find out just how the hell a tomato can possibly
15,01be related to a potato.  Balderdash!
