15,01        second motion


15,01        northwest

15,01    hallucinated amoebaes
15,01    hear the stretch of the glaciers
15,01    see the red disaster
15,01    of the sacrificed aurora borealis
15,01    of the infernal screen
15,01    the one that will prevent you
15,01    to think about the winterhoing in your destroyed voice
15,01    flames will reach your mouth
15,01    and your tongue will decompose
15,01    your cells will split up
15,01    and carbonize the snow by their effervescence
15,01    yea, yea, i could try to shout
15,01    and i'll shit on your corpse of my skin
15,01    to be dismembered
15,01    i could try to weep
15,01        insanitiessible
15,01    cuz she's sticking in my landscape
15,01    i'm coming here to take youbeing able to exit
15,01    we're goingody
15,01    the haemoglobin dropping from her mouth
15,01    average catholic images
15,01    life used to be moral normal with excellent reputation corporative 
15,01parents javellized childhood full of lethargic laughs and microwaveable 
15,01lovei want her to stay
15,01    no way babyt to force myself to watch her at 3am
15,01    the highway is just a second away
15,01    my soiled hand in your sweet blond hair
15,01    shut uphout attacking i lose my only defence

15,01    sweet impaled flesh
15,01        instant departures neighbouring regions
15,01        nocturnal celebrations with sulfuric acid

15,01    seas of sandg you
15,01    skidding continentsu could be
15,01    cannibal torrentme
15,01    don't die anymore
15,01    i'm building my non-existant soul
15,01    from the wounds of my victims
15,01    i lost my sight don't know where
15,01    because of the vinegar
15,01    i will never recover from my insanity
15,01    even with the radiations
15,01    even with the drugs
15,01    every dayyou
15,01    every nightrt again
15,01    even with the insomnias i will never leave the nightmare
15,01    so i can still believe i'm innocent
15,01    i went away
15,01    i left the dump when i saw you weeping
15,01    with an hatchet i broke the bones of my friends
15,01    they shouted and they shut up, petrified
15,01    i closed my eyes
15,01    mist on hometown, usa
15,01    grey pick-up on the nine
15,01    six am

15,01    come with me
15,01    i'm going outta here
15,01    i'm escaping to the states
15,01    don't suffer for me

15,01    to fuck me kiss me fuck me kick me fuck me kill me
15,01    to fuck me
15,01    at some places on the asphalt
15,01    i crucified my realityd
15,01    i carved my acid truth
15,01    i drowned my cephalic territoriesops
15,01    me, that compulsive liar
15,01    i have no intention of repenting myselfsing
