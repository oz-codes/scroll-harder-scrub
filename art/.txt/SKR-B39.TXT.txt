15,01and the words are..

15,01midgets / wrestling / canada


15,01        It was hard to get used to at first.  I mean, I'm used to it now
15,01and all, but when I heard the news that one sunday night a year ago (it
15,01seems like decades ago now) I couldn't believe it at all.  I stared in
15,01slackjawed horror as the screen showed the flag with the maple leaf on
15,01it and started to play the Canadian National Anthem. I didn't even know
15,01they had a National Anthem.  Although it sort of figures like they
15,01would, seeing as how they're a nation and all.

15,01        Except they turned into much more than just a nation.  They
15,01turned into the ultimate form of government ever: a dictatorship.  I
15,01mean ultimate not in a "good" sense, but ulitmate in the "it's going to
15,01be the last form of government" sense.  Because it's true.  The Canadian
15,01government pulled in covert operations experts and started hiring all
15,01the mercenaries it could find.  It trained them in secret locations
15,01miles underneath the frozen tundra.  Huge facilities existed
15,01underground; entire training battles were held in specialized
15,01facilities.  Everything was happening and none of the outside world knew
15,01about it.  Because, after all, what had Canada ever done?  Most
15,01Americans viewed them as the silent neighbor to the north where the
15,01prices always seemed to be higher because of Canadian currency.  War and
15,01Canada seemed like the two farthests thing anyone can think of.

15,01        And, in a way, they didn't really use war.  They merely managed
15,01to subvert all of the major western nations and seize silent control.
15,01Everything was over before anybody realized what was happening.

15,01        It was at that point that the Canadians themselves started to
15,01show their true form.  Instead of mild mannered people with occasional
15,01speech affectations, they grew to be ten foot tall! (Which meant they
15,01were easy to pick out in a crowd, because not only were they taller but
15,01they also had green scales and huge fucking antennae and large black
15,01eyes.  But I guess I didn't mention that.)  Yes, it was true.  All along
15,01the Canadians were merely an alien superrace bent on World Domination
15,01with a capital W and a capital D.

15,01        Soon, almost the entire human race was enslaved.  Millions upon
15,01millions of people were forced to do pointless work for no money.  After
15,01realizing that was too similar to "Dilbert", they began to whip them as
15,01well.  Random acts of brutal violence occured, including the ever famous
15,01"Tic Tac Splat", whereupon unlucky victims were dropped from a crane
15,01onto a giant cement tic-tac-toe board.

15,01        Now I pray for a similar fate.  They have forced me to
15,01participate in professional wrestling, which as you know is worse than
15,01an eternity of cowboy boots, chewing tobacco, and large belt buckles.
15,01They call it "Midget Wrestling", because we humans are so short compared
15,01to our gargantuan captors.

15,01        It's a difficult job because old-style wrestling was all faked;
15,01now it's all real.  Instead of a ring we usually are forced to fight on
15,01the aforementioned giant cement tic-tac-toe boards, usually after a
15,01particularly extended game, as well.

15,01        At night I hold my head in my hands and pray to whatever God is
15,01up there, why, why us?  Why didn't we see through their ruse sooner?.
15,01And then I break down and cry, cry until my eyes can take no more.  Or
15,01until the next match starts. Whichever comes first.
