15,01        Well, this is our first, (and maybe our last) ANSiTooN movie.
15,01        This was orignally suppose to be an ANSi-Type Game.  But we
15,01        figured it was too hard and the slackers we are, I'm surprised
15,01        we even finished this!  This ansimation is pure 100 percent
15,01        ACiD/ANSiTooN Production material.  Well, just sit back have
15,01        fun watching it and please don't edit this ansi in any way
15,01        or I'll have the REAL feds after ya!

15,01        BTW, if your expecting an ANSi from either myself, (JED) or Slash
15,01        don't be expecting it to come out soon since we're both pooped
15,01        from this project.  (Except for Honus Wagner's ANSi).
