15,01        w00p! I'm back for the second issue of... *drum roll*..
15,01"HOW TO DRAW A PRIME EVIL VGA". Anyways...

15,01background on picture:
15,01---------------------
15,01        Well, like 1 or 2 days before the deadline, Quazar was on irc and 
15,01he asked me for my number for the *horns* TRiBE iNTERNAL DiRECTORY. Well 
15,01I gave it to him and he told me I only had till Sunday to up my shit to 
15,01TRiBEbot for the pack. Well at the time I only had this unfinished VGA 
15,01for hardwired (which at this moment I still haven't finished... I guess 
15,01that's what happens when you don't work on something... go figure). 
15,01Well... I had a sudden flash of genius and inspiration... not really. I 
15,01was acually flipping through some of my old AD&D books (damn..its been a 
15,01long time since I've played that..). Anyways, it gave me an idea for a 
15,01picture.
15,01        So I stayed up all night working on this VGA (I'm writing this 
15,01after I drew the pic..unlike last time). After I got through with about 
15,01forearm, I dicided I was gonna make an other *deep voice* HOW TO MAKE A 
15,01PRIME EVIL VGA *medium voice on* (as in a regualr non faggot voice). So 
15,01about every 10 mins I saved my shit. Anyways, this VGA took a lot longer 
15,01than my other ones because of the pixel by pixel shit (the lightning 
15,01bolts....w00p).
15,01        PS - the titles is pe-marv.gif because I guess its a lesson on 
15,01how to make your VGAs look like cheap marvel trading cards... w00p. 
15,01Looking back at this, number 029 with the ugly purple background looks 
15,01like a neato marvel card... But I went ahead and made it Prime Evilish 
15,01and added a black background and lightning bolts and shit...

15,01okEtDoKeY:
15,01tools I used for this VGA:
15,011) pencil tool
15,012) air brush tool
15,013) selection tool
15,014) an anti aliasing software (jag by ray dream is neato elito, I was gay 
15,01and just did it the old fashion way)

15,01btw:
15,01I *really* get annoyed when people ask me what program I use. Unless you 
15,01know what you are doing like Sober does.. IT FUQEN DOESN'T MATTER! Even 
15,01though I rag on Sober a lot (I hope he knows its all funn'in) I admire 
15,01that he knows how to use the prgrams he has insides out. For the average 
15,01VGA artist (errmm..like me) it doesn' fuqen matter who elito burrito your 
15,01program is because you still suck. (my theory: that I'm a terrible VGA 
15,01artist, its just that I know how to draw that saves my vgas from being 
15,01total trash... oh yeah..mouse dexterity helps too.. I'm proud of the fact 
15,01that shockwave (bitch) accused me of scanning... w00p... thats how good I 
15,01am...w00p!) I forgot how many of these parethesies I used) oh yeah... 
15,01read my lit... pehs-tr.lit... the logo is from that coolio mofo Hellspawn 
15,01and the lit is...well mine..) where was I? For the average vga artist its 
15,01not gonna matter half a wit whether you use coral draw or photoshop. When 
15,01you ask me what program I use, it implies that the vga comes from the 
15,01prgram and not throught my skill. So on irc if you ask me what prgram I 
15,01use I'll most likely ban kick you unless you are a coolio mofo liek Drd 
15,01or Cavalier) Anyways, by now you probabbly think I didn;t graduate 3rd 
15,01grade english... so read my lit and suck my ballz, motherfucker!

15,011) draw the shape 
15,01        Even if you know that you are gonna go over the part with a big 
15,01fat black pencil, draw it anyways. It helps keep porportions. Don't be 
15,01afraid to sorta just sketch out the area. Thumbnails (oOoOoOoOo SK told 
15,01me what that meant in the comic book world.. I just thought it was that 
15,01little preview on the side of the dialog box when you open a gif) are 
15,01helpful that way. Once you start knowing your subject matter, you need 
15,01less and less of them, but as you can see, I stil use them in certain places.
15,012) shade
15,01        Even in the black and white stage, shade your shit. just draw the 
15,01borders of the shadows and fill it in with a black pencil. It'll save you 
15,01needless colouring... make it look comicbookish... make it look pe'ish.. 
15,01make it look eliteish
15,013) colour
15,01        w00p... choose a colour scheme and stick with it. Even if you 
15,01colour like shit, like me... if you stay colour coordinated, it'll look 
15,01d0p3 ish even if its not. Coplour scheme that always work for me 
15,01are...gray and red....red and blue... deep blue black... light blue and 
15,01ugly orange (for an example of this if you can't imagine it... look at me 
15,01pe-high.gif in the ice pack..well past ice pack)
