15,01                            Part II, The Counting


15,01                             Now, as I sit here,
15,01                                Alone, and cold,
15,01                           I question my origin,
15,01                            I question my faith,
15,01                                       Who am I?
15,01                           Where do I come from?
15,01                             Where have i been..
15,01                      Where I have been is easy,
15,01           I have rot in hell since my creation,
15,01                      I speak to no one of this,
15,01                                 Except for you, 
15,01                            My beloved brethren,
15,01                                   My only hope,
15,01                        The reader of this tale.
15,01                           Where do I come from?
15,01              I come from the back of your mind,
15,01                                    I sit there, 
15,01                    Waiting for you let me free,
15,01                  Waiting for you to unleash me,
15,01        I sit there gnawing away at your sanity,
15,01                                    I sit there.
15,01                                       Who am I?
15,01                             I am all the fears,
15,01                                     And angers,
15,01                 Hopes and dreams never reached,
15,01                             Never accomplished,
15,01                                     I am those,
15,01               I am the epitomy of your despair,
15,01                            I sit there waiting,
15,01            Knowing that if you ever do find me,
15,01         You will abuse me like you have before,
15,01            Use me for what little power i have,
15,01                      You will learn my secrets,
15,01                    The source of my weaknesses,
15,01                         Use them to control me,
15,01                                I know you will,
15,01               You are just like all the others,
15,01                                Nothing to give,
15,01                              Only much to take,
15,01                  I will give you what you want,
15,01                                  You know that,
15,01                             But i exact a toll,
15,01                                          A fee,
15,01                      You will learn this price,
15,01             You will feel the pain i have felt,
15,01                          Just unlock that door,
15,01I will show you knowledge you will grow to fear,
15,01                      I will rip your heart out,
15,01                          As you have done mine,
15,01               And as i go blank and write this,
15,01              I have lost all control to myself,
15,01                        I am the beast that you,
15,01                                         Myself,
15,01                                   And everyone,
15,01                                   Has created..
15,01             I cannot stand the pain any longer,
15,01                       The walls are closing in,
15,01                 They await around every corner,
15,01                    They search for me at night,
15,01        They hide where they think I cannot see,
15,01                                         But oh,
15,01                                     I see them,
15,01                     And how they try to get me,
15,01             You will laugh when they do get me,
15,01         You will laugh when they begin to feed,
15,01                         Feed on my barren body,
15,01              Feed on what little is left of me,
15,01                               For they are you,
15,01                                And as I ramble,
15,01                  Making little sense to no one,
15,01                               Least of all you,
15,01                                     The reader,
15,01                                   I slide away, 
15,01                               Off the deep end,
15,01                               As you would say,
15,01                  As you would have me put away,
