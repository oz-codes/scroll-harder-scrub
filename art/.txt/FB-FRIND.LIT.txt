15,01Thought we were friends... - Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01As I lie awake, my thoughs are of you...
15,01My mind is a river of emotions with falls to go through.

15,01The tears are welled up, all hidden inside,
15,01not from lack of love, but emmence amount of pride.

15,01It is my faulty to have believed in you,
15,01my suspicion was answered, the truth lay anew.

15,01The tears join the others, the emotions of care,
15,01leaving yet another cross for me to bear.

15,01My mind has forgotten, my soul made amends,
15,01but my heart is still saddened, were not even friends.
