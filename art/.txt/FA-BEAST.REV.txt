15,01The Beast

15,01The beast travels beside the lepers,
15,01Outcasts of a civilized world.
15,01Hated by some, but feared by all.
15,01With an immoral society, doomed to fall.
15,01With revenge on their minds, they take the path
15,01to meet the prince of darkness, and all his wrath.
15,01Pleading with the devil, they trade their souls,
15,01For a chance at revenge, they must pay the toll.
15,01Sent back to the world of the unforgiving
15,01an army of the dead arises,
15,01Selfishly slaughtering all the living,
15,01Just as before, there are no compromises.
