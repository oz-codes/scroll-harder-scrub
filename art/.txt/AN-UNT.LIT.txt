15,01oh, but if not now, then when?

15,01take flight with me,
15,01we'll slough off this watery husk,
15,01the weave means nothing,
15,01too tired, i'm drunk on vapors,
15,01lost to lavender, lost to loss,
15,01but borrowed flesh betrays me.

15,01lips closed and sealed around the teeth,
15,01chewing on a fresh deceit,
15,01do you have a match for me?
15,01it's cold and smells of closing time,
15,01will you take me home to 
15,01wrestle with the night?

15,01speak to me in your soft manner,
15,01you've got a tale to torture,
15,01encroaching words to leave me here, 
15,01beneath the vacuum, whistling,
15,01you'll slip along the beach,
15,01your hand in hand, your mind in mind.

15,01exchanging breath amongst the dead,
15,01me, my grinning foolish boy,
15,01and for the fourth we'll feign, forget
15,01to transcend the tinselled tissue,
15,01but nothing's left beneath the flesh,
15,01but whirring gasps of silence.

15,01oh, but if not now, then when?
