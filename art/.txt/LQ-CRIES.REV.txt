15,01.Cries of the dead.

15,01The spirits of the dead haunt your dreams
15,01They call out to you; frightening screams
15,01Free us from this torturous cell, they cried
15,01Free us from this firey hell; they died.

15,01Imprisoned for their evil intentions
15,01Their crime: creating cruel inventions
15,01Machines of death, chaos, and blight
15,01They had no choice; they couldn't fight

15,01Prisoners chained to walls and beat
15,01Then thrown out to die in the street
15,01Pain and agony was all they could feel
15,01Wished they were dreaming; no this was real

15,01After all their work had been done
15,01They were then killed: one by one
15,01Their life had been spent creating strife
15,01Now was their time; the end of their life

15,01Once they were dead, they went Sheol
15,01Body departed; spirit and soul
15,01Rotting until the end of time
15,01Payment for their terrible crime.
