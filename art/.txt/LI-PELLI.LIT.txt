15,01   Suddenly, over a period of ten years, three months and two days, Pellicule
15,01the Magnificent leapt down from his lofty tricycle, and surveyed the
15,01surrounding countryside.

15,01   "This sucks!" he cried, and went somewhere else.

15,01   The somewhere else he went to was called Shampooville.  No one liked
15,01Shampooville, and so no one lived there, except the town's population of 6.8
15,01billion people.  Pellicule the Magnificent strode into thw town square, and
15,01prepared to make an announcement.  He suddenly realized that the town square
15,01would be a bad place to make an announcement, because a square is such a pissy
15,01little shape.  He got up on the town rhombohedron instead.

15,01   "Mu name is Pellicule the Magnificent!" he declared, after the townspeople
15,01had all gone home.  The sole remaining audience member, a sharp blue
15,01toothbrush, stared in awe at his imposing figure.  His imposing figure was a
15,01small diagram labeled, "figure b."  It was a very imposing figure indeed.  So
15,01imposing that Pellicule the Magnificent himself had to set it on fire to avoid
15,01becoming its slave.

15,01  And so he ate the sharp blue toothbrush, which cut a hole in his esophagus,
15,01through which he bled to death.

15,01   The hole in his esophagus was very displeased, as this violent death would
15,01surely lower property values, and so it moved to Spain.

15,01   Spain was, on the whole, completely disinterested.  Shampooville was about
15,015000 miles from Spain, except on thursdays.

15,01   It was at this point that Pellicule the Magnificent realized what a terrible
15,01mistake he had made.  Or at least he would have, except he was dead, because
15,01there was a big-ass hole in his neck.  He would have been able to realize what
15,01a terrible mistake he had made, had he not tried to swallow a sharp toothbrush.
15,01Of course, swallowing the toothbrush was the mistake he was in the process of
15,01not realizing he had made, due to the fact that he was dead, so he disregarded
15,01the whole shebang and continued being dead.

15,01   His tricycle, which was actually the reincarnated spirit of Kurt Cobain,
15,01suffered a fatal hangnail and died.  The coroners never learned this, however,
15,01because they couldn't find any fingernails on a tricycle, due to their extreme
15,01incompetence.

15,01   The population of 6.8 billion people all ate ice cream with ball bearings on
15,01top.  They gave it a nice, sparkly texture and some real crunch.  Dentists in
15,01Shampooville were wealthy men.  See figure b.  The town government decided they
15,01didn't like the uneven number, and rounded in off to 7 billion people, by
15,01dumping aphrodesiacs in the javex, so everyone who tried to commit suicide had
15,01children first.

15,01   The extra .2 billion people didn't like Shampooville, so they burned it to
15,01the ground.  They even burned the ground they had burned Shampooville to.

15,01   Then they all moved to Spain, and mysteriously disappeared when they all
15,01fell into a hole.

15,01   +  END  +
