15,01I see enjoyment here.
15,01I see knowledge and prestigue there.
15,01They say the grass is greener on the other side.

15,01The choice I never thought I must make
15,01Is turning 'to my biggest twist of fate.
15,01Gripping .. Pulling .. Yanking me away from sanity.

15,01Running here, trying to be there.
15,01I cannot satisfy all .. life isn't fair.
15,01Oh why is it so hard?

15,01Life is the way it is and will never change.
15,01Only the strong survive they say.
15,01Even the strong have a weakness or two.

15,01Screaming is a temporary solve.
15,01Crying makes your emotions revolve.
15,01Stoism increases the pain.

15,01Take me away ... away from it all.
15,01Come now before I start to fall.
15,01Catch me and save me from this agony.

15,01Anger grips hold of me tightly.
15,01Tears trace my cheeks nightly.
15,01I now understand the emotion will never leave me.

15,01Oh, to be without emotion is the answer.
15,01For it is emotion that is the cancer.
15,01Emotion begone .. leave me be.

15,01It is a never-ending decision .. one I will never make.
15,01This choice is made by them .. while everything I do is fake.
15,01Oh how I yearn to free myself.

15,01They have decided .. I am their toy.
15,01I am lead by the hand like a young boy.
15,01Lost forever in other's hopes and expectations of me.

15,01Usul's inspiration for this particular piece go to the following:

15,01        "A Touch Of Spring" Composed by Purple Motion/FC from the Journey
15,01                MusicDisk #1
15,01        An interesting note from an interesting person
15,01        His totally messed up life

15,01A note from Usul:
15,01----------------

15,01I am not extremely happy with this piece as my first official Lit. for
15,01Visual Insanity, but it will have to do.  Creating what I usually create
15,01is always overshadowed by my current emotion.  Chances are, you won't even
15,01understand this unless you are at a particular stage in your life as I am.
15,01Don't give up and keep fighting.

15,01I want to thank everyone who deserves it.  You know who you are.  No need to
15,01list them.

15,01I also want to tell all you literary artists out there to keep working.  It 
15,01may not be as glamorous as drawing or composing, but it's an artform in its 
15,01own self.  Never give it up ... no matter what anyone says.
