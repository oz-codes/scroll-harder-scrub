15,01A Soul Beckoning Towards Retreat        
15,01        
15,01        At that back of every mind,
15,01There is a space...
15,01        Where the spirit meets back with the reason,
15,01We feel each as it moves across our dreams and landscapes,
15,01Nothing can touch what we see. 
15,01Life, chaos, liberty...
15,01I step back and now I believe it's life or it's simplicy.

15,01Night running chills 
15,01Up my back,
15,01Strike it down with the need to know
15,01That my mind will not sustain,
15,01Being flat...
15,01Hidden in a limited box-

15,01I am going out to touch
15,01The burning air
15,01The winds that scorched my tounge
15,01And burnt out my eyes,
15,01But the means to retrieve is still there,
15,01In those burning last seconds, clash and reality broken,
15,01Then do you understand...?

15,01Life,
15,01Filling every need
15,01Filling all my needs,
15,01I will never rise above or below,
15,01But in the end of all experience that light which 
15,01   claims me,
15,01I stand alone
15,01And above...
15,01Listening to my family's echoing woes,
15,01Of a soul beckoning towards reteat-
