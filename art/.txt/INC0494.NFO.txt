15,01# Welcome to the first pack, to view ansis or listen to mods, use incview.exe.
15,01  It is our viewer coded by Kano, and it was done in a bit of a hurry so if you
15,01  find any bugs e-mail an incarnate member on a board they call.

15,01# Things are going well for iNCARNATE, we've picked up many new members over the

15,01  past few weeks. If you are interested in joining, e-mail The Weasel on any of
15,01  the iNCARNATE Member Boards or HQs.

15,01# I know that there has been a lot of bad blood between iNCARNATE and X-Products

15,01  lately. I'd like to say that I have no interest in argueing anymore, so I will

15,01  not start anything, as long as no one starts anything with me.

15,01# Enjoy the pack if you got any questions, or comments mail The Weasel on any
15,01  board he calls.
