15,01- Traitor -


15,01Damn you, traitor! Fuckin' die!
15,01Burn forever in your lies!
15,01Place your head on the chopping stone;
15,01Guilloutine blade - sharp and honed.

15,01Watch as the cord is severed;
15,01Falling blade takes forever,
15,01Until it reaches for your throat -
15,01Executioner laughs and gloats.

15,01Head rolls down the platform steps;
15,01Mind rolls down to the devil's depths.
15,01No more lies from the fuckin' traitor -
15,01Only the flames that will burn you later.

15,01Severed head shoved on a spike;
15,01Blood pours forth like a broken dike.
15,01Dead in grief - Dead in shame,
15,01And you've only got yourself to blame.

15,01Your loyalty you sold for wealth;
15,01Gave your soul to someone else.
15,01Now your mistake daunts you;
15,01Forever, it will eternal haunt you.

15,01Worse even than hell's flames -
15,01King and country curse your name;
15,01Spit on your carcass, on the floor -
15,01Devil's Nightmare; Traitor's door.
