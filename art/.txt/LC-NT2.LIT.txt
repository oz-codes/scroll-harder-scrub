15,01Things all seem so simple,
15,01Until you look inside,
15,01To see the workings spinning,
15,01The things that people hide.

15,01Just below the surface,
15,01Down there in the dark,
15,01Until the piston moves again,
15,01Prodded by one spark.

15,01It makes a lot of sense to me,
15,01That every one can't tell,
15,01For I, like you, have secrets too,
15,01You don't know me all that well.

15,01There are things that I keep to myself,
15,01That I choose not to share,
15,01They'll stay that way until the day,
15,01When I'm convinced you care.

15,01If you want to see inside,
15,01You must come closer still,
15,01Open your mind and take the time,
15,01Then perhaps you will.
