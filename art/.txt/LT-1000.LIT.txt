15,01  02T12h00is shattered mirror holds the only
15,01   02t12r00uth, the sole reflection of our
15,01  02e12x00istence which is broken into
15,01   02f12r00agments. Each frail piece holds a
15,01  02d12i00sorted view of double standards and 
15,01   02h12i00dden agendas. Each a sliver captures a
15,01  02c12r00acked glimpse on scenarios of our
15,01   02e12x00ploitation. Each culture scrapes its
15,01  02i12n00dentity attempting to squeeze through
15,01   02t12h00e cracks. But perhaps the most
15,01  02f12r00ightening image of all is the blank
15,01   02e12x00pression on the face of our society.
15,01  02H12o00w can we look at this anymore?
