15,01T'was the night before release and all through the scene,
15,01Spawn ANSis were being drawn as if it were Holloween.
15,01The NFO and member list were in the directory with care,
15,01in hopes that some members work would soon join it there.

15,01And I with my virus scanner, and the board with THD,
15,01had just settled down to figure out what screwed me.
15,01When out in another window there grew such a clatter,
15,01it was the damn modem, "Now what's the matter!"

15,01He blew past the NUP so easily and slick,
15,01and left a comment about ZZets, so I F5ed him quick. 
15,01After the the modem dropped his ass,
15,01I went back to see F-PROT say my HD did pass.

15,01Now a call on nodes one, three and eight,
15,01finally some art, I could hardly wait.
15,01They went straight to doing thier shit.
15,01They uploaded Gifs, ansis, and an occational lit.

15,01They left with /o, bye, and even a drop carrier.
15,01Now its time to see if I can break the 2 meg barrier.
15,01I zipped it and dizzed it with one simple whack,
15,01the couriers would be happy only a 1.6 meg pack.

15,01Now the couriers came and I counted and put a check by thier name,
15,01on Aarzak, on Kreiger, on Stoner and Soul T,
15,01on Targa, on Zodiac, on Thor and Quad Z.
15,01From the Beginning of the file onto the very end,
15,01click Zmodem, click IceZModem, now send send send.

15,01And I heard them exclaim as they logged off with accord,
15,01You'll get it 0 day, unless you have a shitty board.
