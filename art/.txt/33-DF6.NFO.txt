15,01-/- Information -/-

15,01This movie was designed on a 486/33. That is, on other machines, the movie 
15,01may run slower or faster. If your computer is faster than mine, then I 
15,01suggest you to turn off the turbo switch before running the movie. In the 
15,01next releases I'll try to make this compatible with all machines.

15,01To have all the fonts and fade effects, you must have a VGA card. However, 
15,01if you only have a CGA or EGA, you just have to run the movie in the 
15,01no-effects mode.

15,01When your bored to wait, just strike any key and the movie will continue. 
15,01Also, [Esc] almost anywhere will quit the proggie.

15,01For a movie I ask $15 US or $20 CDN. Or you can offer me a real big trade. 
15,01Since this represents a LOT of work, I make no free movies, sorry. :(

15,01If you want to do a VGA font for my next movies, contact me. I will give 
15,01you a program that does that quite easily.
