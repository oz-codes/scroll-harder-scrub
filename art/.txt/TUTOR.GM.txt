15,01 Are your players lost? Have no idea what to do? here are some ideas toey
15,01 get them going...ortune of running into D4 skeletons like the ones from
15,01 town.                   14,15  15,01  14,15  15,01 14,15   15,01 14,15  15,01 14,15  15,01 "14,15   15,01"
15,01A cry for help!y travel this road, from the town, and north, they run the
15,01 - a woman comes up to the heroes, (seeing by their weapons that they're
15,01   the adventuring sort,) and begs them to go to (one of your trouble
15,01   spots) to find her (relative, dog, whatever) If they seem un-interested,
15,01   offer a reward.***********************************************************

15,01A scary encounter...e it. If they have the amulet from the guy to the north,
15,01 - while wandering about, they fight off some minor monsters, but before the
15,01   last runs away, it turns into a dangerous looking man, and says***********
15,01   "You're as strong as they say.. we'll meet again.."
15,01   When they ask anyone about the man they saw, a villager (or whoever) says:
15,01   "Oh my! that's _______ who lives at ______! (one of your trouble spots?)e
15,01   "you'd best keep away from him!"
15,01   Of course, they can't. They're heroes.
15,01   If they don't go right away, have the man attack them again, tease them,**
15,01   taunt them, play dangerous tricks on them. You may just develop anead end,
15,01   arch-villan, who will always annoy the characters, and always escapesmor,
15,01   final defeat..ty good for level 1 guys.. of course, by now, there's a slim
15,01 chance they COULD be level 2..)
15,01The mentor you've GOTTA have the dice. 20 sides, 12 sides, 10 sides, 8 sides,
15,01 - You may create a character, perhaps of authority of some sort, whoBLE
15,01   helps the heroes out. Sometimes this mentor will ask them favors...lot
15,01   "please protect my messanger.. he needs to pass though the woods tofind
15,01    town x, and they say vampires roam those woods.."n 4 players begins to
15,01    (this might turn into a large scale battle, trying to get the messangerk,
15,01     back from a horde of vampires.. play it as you feel it..)ed.hts' without
15,01   "The people of town z are troubled by frequent attacks by a (whatever)"harm
15,01    This may lead to just a fight at a town, or maybe a search for
15,01    some monster's secret lair!
15,01 [fire erupts from the slot, rising a foot or so above the floor.] characters
15,01  This is a paticularly useful and easy way to get players going on a task.!
15,01  Once you get the hang of this, you can start to make intricate plots,
15,01  made out of seemingly random encounters, people in distress, ledgends
15,01  told over a pint of ale, and the sagely advice from the old wise man..
15,01 [the door creaks open to reveal a small chamber, containing only a slumped
15,01 figure in the corner. The door squeak wakes it, and it begins to get up.ng
15,01ALRIGHT! now... you have a lot to do, and there's lots to keep player'sor,
15,01busy.. but.. every world just cries out for one problem that is so huge,
15,01so frightening, and terrifying, that all fear it, and none dare oppose it.
15,01This problem may be an enemy occupying army...  an insane, god-like monster,
15,01or invaders from another dimension..d thing that they have to beat!
15,01 Start him out with 100 HP.
15,01Make it good, cuz this will be the main plot. Maybe, as the heroes travel,
15,01and do good deeds, they'll hear about this problem, find clues about it'samage
15,01origin, or maybe just be inconvenienced by it, never quite knowing for suree.
15,01what importance it has until much later.

15,01That enemy army.. their troops sure make a lot of trouble at the inn..easy for
15,01         Their leader has never been seen..ger than his 100 HP, just longst
15,01         They've blocked the road south..ts them, have them wake up in the
15,01         They pester any travellers.., and THIS time they face him, be
15,01         They've got a base in town, and people have been disappearing..*****
15,01The town: They will likely come here a few times at least. It's your run
15,01         with a threat like this, you can fight the lower ranks, a grand gate.
15,01         but still have a LOT of trouble left to go around...." A ghost
15,01  appears breifly before fading into the darkness. Where have you seen that
15,01That god-like monster..yers ask, you must come up with a reasonable response.
15,01         100 years ago, it destroyed several towns, then declared itself ruler
15,01         It's tower sits on mount (whatever) and it has no doors.rown falls
15,01         Anyone opposing it is visited by it's pet (big scary monster)
15,01         Brainwashed servants, causing trouble of their own..
15,01  They all gain 30%-40% experience.
15,01    heck! there's all sorts of things that could be big problems! In fact,
15,01    you could give a world dozens of HUGE problems.. the main thing is that
15,01    the cluse should be revealed over a long period of time, through]
15,01    smaller problems, and the players should be of a HIGH level before they
15,01    can face that problem's head menace, and bring some peace to the land.
15,01 1- sell the crown to a shop keeper, who will offer $200 bucks for it.
15,01    Long before this, your world should be well under way, and you'll
15,01    probably have quite a lot of ideas about your world, and will probably
15,01    become attached to it.. along the way you'll probably become a GMing, and
15,01    ACE..do the last one, this is their best option. (but don't tell them!)
15,01 ["Grandfather's crown!" the king says. ]le in town, they'll meet 3 guards.
15,01       Now then, teach a friend how, so YOU can play.. :)
