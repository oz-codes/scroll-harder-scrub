15,01Exile

15,01   The loud creaking of the gates struck unseen blows to the mighty warrior.
15,01He had heard it a million times before, but never like this.  He had always
15,01been listening from the inside, and not the outside looking in.  For the 
15,01first time in his life, the soldier felt alone.  No friends to cover his back
15,01and no chance to re-enter the place he once called home.  He had been brave
15,01for the people of the city, he put his life on the line countless times, and
15,01now... now...  One mistake.  One mistake cost the lives of his troop.  Fall-
15,01ing asleep on his watch, providing a window of opportunity for the enemy 
15,01soldiers.  He cheated death but the others were not as lucky. The only thing
15,01worse than dying is being the only one to survive.
15,01   Looking for comfort from the people of the city, his people, he received
15,01none.  They forgot all of his past deeds, his conquests in their names.  The
15,01only thing they could remember was the death of his soldiers.  So alone he
15,01stands.  Looking longingly at the gates shutting him out from the life he 
15,01once had lived.  With a sigh, the mighty warrior turned and walked off to-
15,01wards the horizon, ready to being a new life.  A life of exile...
