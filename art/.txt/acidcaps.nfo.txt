15,01       With the coming of winter, people will be making some changes to their
15,01  wardrobe.  New shirts,  new pants,  new shoes,  (and  glasses,  so you have
15,01  them), etc.  But  why  limit  yourself  to things that may go out of style?
15,01  Get a hat!  Hats are  a  great  addition to any outfit, and can be used for
15,01  many purposes.  They can keep  your  hair  out of your face,  they'll  help
15,01  you  develop  the  much  lusted after  "hat head",  and you can even use it
15,01  to keep your head warm!  And what better hat to get than an ACiD cap?

15,01       For those of you that like choices, and don't we all, we have two for
15,01  you:

15,01    #1  -  Option One one is a straight black cap with the ACiD logo in a
15,01           deep forest green and white trim.

15,01    #2  -  Option Two boasts a two-tone color mix, caramel-brown crown and
15,01           a black brim.  The ACiD logo is white-filled with a phat black
15,01           outline.

15,01       Both of these hats flaunt  the  embroidered  ACiD logo designed by RaD
15,01  Man, are made from a  soft,  supple  wool-blend  that just makes your mouth
15,01  water and lets your head breathe.  (And we all know that if your head can't
15,01  breathe, well then.  You have problems.)  Size is something that should not
15,01  concern you here, big head or small, these are one size-fits-all caps.
