15,01                --The latest and the <not so> greatest--

15,01     Kay here's the deal.  About 8:45 Thursday night I get a call from Dosage
15,01here in CA.  He asks if I have the code done for our groups lil' Ansi viewer.
15,01Up to this point all the work I had invested had been merely investigative --
15,01trying things out to see how they work.  So, no, I hadn't.  When I asked him
15,01why he told me there was this new group out somewhere in the far away reaches
15,01of Cyberspace which was in need of a viewer, and could I write one in about 45
15,01minutes.  Upon initially looking on the project I had figured, sure, no
15,01problem...  boy what a mistake.

15,01     Here I am, about 10 coding hours later, and I've finally finished <whew!>
15,01What resulted from that flurry of scratch-coding is a very basic ANSi-ONLY
15,01viewer -- no RIP, no GIF, no MOD and no VGA support.  I realise that a lot of
15,01people were put at an inconvenience due to my mis-estimations on time (ie.
15,01just gimme 30 more minutes...)  but I finally got it done.  Servicable, buggy
15,01and the first .60gamma release, RaveView is now in full project.  Of course by
15,01the next RAVE pack there will be a definite change -- for instance, there will
15,01actually be some sort of nice interface with which to interact.  However, as it
15,01stands, this was my first shot at doing a non-parsing ANSi viewer, implementing
15,01only those ANSi codes as found in my DOS Instant Reference -- I promise better
15,01support next time ... really!

15,01     In any case, Enjoy the viewer.  There shouldn't be any system-harmful bugs
15,01in it (no resources are tapped), but there are bound to be quirks.  If anything
15,01major surfaces, it would be greatly appreciated if you could report to
15,01"Shattered Beliefs" at (310) 541-9779, an ART-based board in California, via
15,01Email to "The Flaming Phoenix", or through the Internet at
