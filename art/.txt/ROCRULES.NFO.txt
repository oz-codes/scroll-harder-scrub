00,01-  If you  ha15ve a proble14m  with the  management 15or feel you 00have a better
00,01   sugestion, 15then  let 14us know. We are a group15, not a  dict00atorship.  We
00,01   wil listen 15and try to 14compromise the best we 15can.

00,01-  Try not to 15start  gro14up wars. Don't  drag th15e  whole grou00p  in against
00,01   another gr15oup, it is 14a stupid and lame thing 15to do. Just 00don't do it.

00,01-  Members of 15ROC are al14lowed to be in more tha15n  one group 00at a time, so
00,01   long as  i15t does  not 14interfere  with your w15ork  with ROC00. If for some
00,01   reason,  y15our product14ivity decreases  becaus15e of your inv00olvement with
00,01   another gr15oup, you  w14ill  be notified  of ou15r concern  an00d appropriate
00,01   actions wi15ll follow.

14,01    00ROC  pack15s  are  pla14nned  to  be sent  out 15every  month  00on  the 1st.
00,01This means  a15ll work tha14t  members would like  15to submit to 00the pack need
00,01to be uploade15d  to the R14OC World  Headquarters 15by the 28th o00f each month.
00,01To  continue 15to  be a me14mber  of ROC, you  do n15eed  to be pr00oductive.  We
00,01expect  that 15you do  cal14l the WHQ and find  out 15what is goin00g on with the
00,01group and get 15your assig14nments.

14,01    00Each  mem15ber of ROC 14is  required  to  submi15t  AT  LEAST  00one piece of
00,01work to each 15monthly pac14k.  This piece must be 15of high quali00ty.  However,
00,01we do  unders15tand  that 14some  months certain  t15hings  will  00come  up  and
00,01there  won't 15be time  to 14get a piece of  work d15one that meet00s the quality
00,01standards for  15the pack, 14or  maybe you won't  e15ven submit a 00piece at all.
00,01either way, t15he first ti14me this happens, it's n15ot a problem.  00You will be
00,01put under  pr15obation, fo14r a  lack of better wor15ds.  The seni00or staff will
00,01make  sure th15at  the nex14t pack you  give someth15ing of higher 00quality.  If
00,01the next mont15h rolls aro14und and still no  work 15has  been rec00ieved or that
00,01which meets t15he standard14s you will be thrown ou15t of the grou00p.  There are
00,01certain excep15tions. Thes14e measures  are just to 15ensure that  00members keep
00,01productive.

00,01    Distribut15ion sites a14re required to have the 15latest pack 00online at all
00,01times.  You m15ust  also k14eep a board  of good qu15ality. We don00't think that
00,01this is askin15g too  much14.  Most times, when thi15ngs go well, 00the pack will
00,01be delivered 15by our cour14iering staff.  There ma15y be  times w00here you need
00,01to call and p15ick up the 14pack. Failure to keep u15pdated with t00he packs will
00,01result in the 15terminatio14n of your distribution 15site. General00ly, We accept
00,01only one  dis15tribution s14ite per  area code.  As 15with  all ru00les there are
00,01certain exemp15tions.

15,01    00Couriers  15aren't ask14ed to do  too much.  On15ce a month th00ey do however
00,01need to call 15their  assi14gned boards and upload 15the newest RO00C pack. Or in
00,01other cases, 15call artist14s and pick up their wor15k for the pac00k.
