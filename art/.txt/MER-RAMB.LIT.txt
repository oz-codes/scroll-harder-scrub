15,01Life is pointless without challenge.  Utopia is a paradox, as in Utopia,
15,01all man's problems are solved.  But perseverance over challenge is an
15,01essential part of human nature, and Utopia must take this away.  Utopia
15,01cannot possibly be perfect and cannot possibly exist then.  Without
15,01challenge we would literally die of boredom.  The entire point to our
15,01existance seems to be the creation of a Utopia that would, esentially,
15,01destroy us.  Perhaps Utopia is asymptopic: we can get closer and closer,
15,01but never reach it.  The entire point of our life is to reach it, but
15,01the closer we come, the more and more pointless our existance becomes.

15,01My father went into a bookstore the other day.  He tells me he was surprised
15,01when he entered to find three shelves filled with religious books, but only
15,01one shelf of scientific books.  I find this laughable, but not surprising.
15,01My father is very intelligent, I was quite surprised the other day when he
15,01said he thought drugs should be legalised.  I shouldn't have been surprised,
15,01though.  Too bad we don't get along.  We always end up treating each other
15,01like children.  I always crack up laughing when he tells me of the stunts
15,01he pulled when he was an engineer.  One of them even included taking an
15,01old tank from a scrapyard, putting wheels on it, and driving it around
15,01UBC.  Giving the science men free beer with a chemical that turned their
15,01urine red was also pretty good, though.

15,01I cannot think of a job that I would truely enjoy doing.  If I work just
15,01to make money just to survive, what's the point?  I'm making money to
15,01continue my existance to make more money.  If I don't enjoy it, what the
15,01hell is the point?  There are so many people like this.  They work so that
15,01they may put bread on the table.  Why?  So they can survive for another
15,01day and continue doing the same thing they've always done.  A pointless
15,01message.. did I say message?  I meant job.  A pointless job that only
15,01serves to put bread on their table.

15,01What is enjoyment, anyway.  It is a chemical that flows though the brain.
15,01It is an illusion.  It can be replicated.

15,01Eventually, humans will have machines do everything for them.  They will
15,01be plugged into a wall.  They will live for ever.  They won't do anything,
15,01they'll just have emotions pumped into them.  That is what we seem to
15,01desire, a life of comfort and of nothingness.  Just immortality and a
15,01constant supply of the happiness chemical.  The man who discovers the
15,01happiness chemical will become a millionaire indeed, and will be able
15,01to afford it by the gallon.

15,01Simple does not mean stupid.

15,01I miss my friends.  True, they're bigotted, shallow fucks, but I miss them.
15,01I miss being able to laugh with people.  During the summer, they suddenly
15,01came to the decision that I was a loser and not to be associated with.  No
15,01real reason.  They've done this before to another person.  Who, of course,
15,01is once again an associate.  So why do I miss these people?

15,01I'm too shy to meet any other people.  I don't think I've ever really made a
