15,01        Karma.. ugh. Karma has great members but lacks good leadership. Its_\/
15,01leaders are hardly involved in the scene, and from my viewpoint, are hardly
15,01ever in contact with their members. Karma would prove themselves if they could
15,01keep theirselves on track and keep up with the scene, something that hasn't
15,01been shown to date.he future hold for Remorse?  In some ways, it doesn't

15,01        Hazmat.. ah. Hazmat, CIA's ascii division. A sortted group with members
15,01that are great, and some who aren't so great but have great potential. I look
15,01forward to the next couple packs from this group. If they keep on track like
15,01they've been doing, they could turn out to be a major group in the scene.
15,01gameshow idea I had...  First of all, we start out with 3 contestants, and
15,01        Aspire.. doh! RIP. Aspire, Gwydian(aka Puff)'s group died about 2 or
15,01so months ago. This group had potential to be a great group but when gwydian
15,01decided to remove the ansi division, which i definately thought was a bad move,
15,01it lost its popularity. After this happened the group slowly faded away. And
15,01sad to say, a local scene died with it. One good thing though, is that Gwydian
15,01is now in remorse, woohoo.own 3 photos of 3 different people's faces.  Two __
15,01of them are normal people, and the third is infact a midget.  The/\ / /\  / /\
15,01        Element.. oooh. Element, Kayozz's label or whatever,(what the hell are
15,01these things?) shows off its skillz pretty often with great collies. I always
15,01look forward to a colly from one of the artists under the element label.
15,01We will need 10 rounds, 10 midgets and 20 normal people per round.  When
15,01        Arcade.. ??. Dezibel's label. This guy is great, i love his ascii, but
15,01i have no idea who the hell else is under the arcade label..a midget, they
15,01buzz in and get a small cash prize.                              |
15,01        Then theres the people in the scene. I think everybody has pretty much
15,01matured over the years. I remember when i first joined #ascii. Oh boy. I got
15,01banned for having the nick "df" because it was some server. This caused me to
15,01hate the ops in #ascii back then. But now look at the ops, more mature, not
15,01banning people for stupid reasons as much, and there isn't as much anti-op
15,01whinning as there used to be. A couple weeks ago i recall somebody hating
15,01remorse because of the way we treat people in #ascii. This guy must be a
15,01fucking weenie. I got banned all the time from #ascii when i was new, i put up
15,01with it(for awhile), but this guy cant when its not even close as much. People,
15,01you are in fucking heaven compared to what it used to be, so if i hear whining,
15,01ill just ban you and ignore you.eral.                            |

15,01filled with hungry (possibly rabid?) badgers.  We might get censored on
15,01- r3volutionut I think the kids will like it.  Don't worry, I don't think, you
15,01  Remorse1981will happen to the badgers...  The midget will not have anyne
15,01weapons with which to hurt the badgers.  He will also most likely beght -- We
