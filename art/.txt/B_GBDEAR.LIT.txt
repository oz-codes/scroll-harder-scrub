15,01# Lyrics and Music by Beatle

15,01You came to me today, said you're going away
15,01To a far away place, far far away from here
15,01The look on your face, it says goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01I, I have nothing to say, you wouldn't want to hear
15,01Hear the words in my head, they're talking to me my dear
15,01Dear, so this is it my dear, this is the end
15,01Won't you say it my dear, dear whisper in my ear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01I, I don't feel any pain, it's all gone away
15,01To a far away place, far far away from here
15,01The look, look on my face, it says goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
15,01Dear, goodbye my dear
