15,01I am a rare insect.       (this one's just silly. april 19th)

15,01I am a rare, sectional, easy-to-assemble insect.
15,01I come supplied with my own threads,
15,01cogs, and batteries,
15,01a leaf to live under,
15,01and a diet of paper.

15,01I crawl through oceans of literature,
15,01two of six legs holding on for dear life.
15,01From lifeboat to raft I jump and slither,
15,01before curling into the spine
15,01for the night.

15,01My antennae glow, red and drooping.
15,01My body is bright blue.
15,01I am unwelcome on most coffee-tables
15,01and in someone's dinner mug.
15,01Kitty-corner to the door
15,01I slink away.

15,01Postscript: Please spare your size 15 shoe
15,01            another day or two.
