15,01+ The Cure

15,01Life must be better then this
15,01There must be a cure

15,01My only dream is my quest
15,01To find the cure
15,01The pain within me must end
15,01It must be released

15,01If only I had the cure
15,01The solution to the pain
15,01Maybe my life would be fulfilled
15,01Prosperous, meaningful

15,01Maybe happiness would be once again
15,01My friend instead of my enemy

15,01It's all so confusing to me
15,01And to those few that know my pain

15,01The war within me, the battle between
15,01Good vs Evil
15,01Emotions, feelings, thoughts
15,01Are all twisted around
15,01Like a never ending roller coaster ride

15,01So each day I cry out
15,01To stop "The Ride"
15,01To find "The Cure"
15,01But loneliness is my friend
15,01So my requests are never heard
15,01Never answered

15,01So the ride continues
15,01Like a never ending roller coaster ride
15,01Without "The Cure"
