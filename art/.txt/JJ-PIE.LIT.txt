15,01lines
15,01lines of sky.
15,01skyline.
15,01tease.

15,01tickle your hair
15,01with the light.
15,01carress of air
15,01flowing past
15,01flesh.

15,01twinge of desire

15,01twitch of reality.

15,01looking for something
15,01that'll get me off
15,01even more than life itself.

15,01I want more.

15,01I want out.
15,01I want immortality.
15,01I hope I live to
15,01use technology to acheive this.

15,01if not I will have
15,01to do it the hard way.
15,01and be in the minds and on the lips
15,01of our culture.
15,01maybe music.
15,01maybe paint.
15,01maybe
15,01      poems ?
