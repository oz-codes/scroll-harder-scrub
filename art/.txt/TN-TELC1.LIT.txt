00,01I 14admit that I'm guilty, I have no regret00s,
00,01I 14meet death with a smile, I don't want you to fre00t.
00,01Th14e feeling was worth it when I gazed at my knif00e,
00,01Th14e feeling I felt to have taken someones lif00e.

00,01It14's been 20 years, alone in my cel00l,
00,01As 14I look back behind me, and I bid it farewel00l.
00,01I 14hear the bars closing, for the very last tim00e,
00,01Th14is is my punishment, for my unforgivable crim00e.

00,01I 14walk past the cells, the inmates all chee00r,
00,01Fo14r being so brave facing the ultimate fea00r.
00,01I 14take my last breath, and smell death in the ai00r,
00,01As 14I sit back and I laugh, strapped in the chai00r.

00,01I 14am afrai00d.
