15,01| What's BloodView?
15,01+--------------------------------------------.- .. .

15,01With bloodview you can softscroll thru "ANSI" textfiles. However, you 
15,01can  use it to view  any  kind  of  textfile  but  don't forget  that 
15,01BloodView was made for viewing ANSI-files with more than 25 lines. so 
15,01don't get jerky if bv doesn't load your non-ANSI-textfiles correctly! 
15,01BloodView should display the files exactly as  the "TYPE" DOS command 
15,01does (with ANSI.SYS installed)  except that BloodView  has  some more 
15,01features.

15,01| Black Maiden edition?
15,01+--------------------------------------------.- .. .

15,01This is a special version for  Black Maiden  which includes some new
15,01features. It is a part of the Black Maiden Art Pack.  Of course, you 
15,01may use it for every  ANSI  you  want  but please  don't spread this  
15,01edition seperately...

15,01| Bugfixed?  
15,01+--------------------------------------------.- .. .

15,01The last Bloodview BM edition was  full of bugs.  This is because it
15,01was done in a  "quick'n'dirty" way.  I had not much time  to include 
15,01all functions and I had virtually no time to test them.
15,01This bugfixed version has been running o.k. for some time  and there 
15,01shouldn't be too many bugs left in it. However, I had to remove some
15,01functions, which were not working yet.  And I am currently bothering
15,01with the 3.0  Version  which is completely different from the former
15,01versions and which will be released ..well .. as soon as it's ready,
15,01sooner or later. Hope it works o.k. this time!

15,01| how to run Bloodview
15,01+--------------------------------------------.- .. .

15,01There's not much to say about that! You can either run  "BV"  without
15,01any parameters  or you can specify the filename of the file you wanna 
15,01view as a commandline parameter.

15,01Here's a short overview of all the "switches" you can turn on or off:

15,01EGA MODE       - EGA MODE is a video  mode where every text character
15,01                 is 8 pixels wide.  Most ANSIs look much  cooler with
15,01                 EGA MODE turned on.

15,01ICECOLOR MODE  - if enabled the blinking is disabled and you have  16
15,01                 background colors instead (used in some ANSIs).

15,01SAUCE          - SAUCE   stands   for:   "Standard  Architecture  For
15,01                 Universal  Comment  Extensions"  It's  an  extension 
15,01                 to every file  which  contains  the  title,  author, 
15,01                 group,  and  some  extra information about the file. 
15,01                 SAUCE  was  developed  by ACID and is e.g. supported 
15,01                 by AcidDraw.
15,01                 If turned on  BloodView reads the SAUCE  information
15,01                 and  displays  the name,  author,  and group of each
15,01                 file while displaying the file.
15,01                 Also, if ANSI or PCBOARD  mode is turned off but the
15,01                 SAUCE-info  indicates  that  a  file does use PCB or 
15,01                 ANSI  codes  or  that it  contains  binary  data  it 
15,01                 automatically switches to the correct mode.

15,01ANSI CODES     - toggles ANSI code support on/off

15,01PCBOARD MACROS - toggles  PCBOARD  macro  support  on/off.  I did not
