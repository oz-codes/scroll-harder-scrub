15,01the self seeking
15,01at last confronted
15,01requested
15,01denied
15,01made to beg in the night
15,01she tells me she is lucky
15,01cause she can seperate her mind
15,01from her body
15,01thats why the other girls
15,01out there on the street go crazy
15,01they can't seperate
15,01$40 for a lay
15,01just curious I say
15,01what else is there to ask
15,01when a freind is working the
15,01streets
15,01to confess the beautiful
15,01human facts
15,01I fall asleep
15,01stareing at clouds on a park bench
15,01I wake up to a man with a camera
15,01asking me if he can take my picture
15,01he wants me to come home with him and finally asks
15,01how much
15,01I slam his face with my fist
15,01he runs, bleeding
15,01I bleed as well
15,01dreams kept still
15,01sometimes I let myself enjoy it
15,01but usually I try not to
15,01it is usually over within seven minutes
15,01I looked up at to drunken bums
15,01they were dazed
15,01I sat in the sun
15,01I hear you can get good deals at four in the morning
15,01when they're dieing for a fix
15,01the dead rise every day
15,01I lay my face in her hair
15,01and breath deep
15,01sweet indian perfumes
15,01The last thing I remember
15,01from that night
15,01lost in the middle of a terrible fight
15,01and later a dismal cafe
15,01cold coffee with nothing to say
15,01I stagered out, mind ablaze
15,01I try and sleep
15,01its like a maze
15,01patterns of thought running in
15,01constant loops
15,01and I have to do all this
15,01just to get throught the
15,01hoops
