15,01                                the shadow wood

15,01             two lovers borne in light, safe from a twisted blight
15,01          made haven in the midst of Shadow Wood, that cold midnight.
15,01               a forest thread with trees, and narrowing decrees
15,01        the spirits spoke the lovers' words while bowing on their knees.
15,01            for dread was this Wood's feel, what misery would steal
15,01          the two laid there would take it 'way and make it all unreal
15,01           the trees, who feared to fall, recursed their freedom call
15,01           and once again the spirits knew the love sought by us all.
15,01                   they drifted aimlessly, a fragmented glory
15,01       for still they reigned as spectres set to live, but still not free
15,01            what had they in their path, and in their peaceful wrath
15,01           then soon partook in punishment yet craved it's aftermath
15,01               the apparations they, took with them night and day
15,01        the lovers took their vows to heart, the Wood was there to stay.
