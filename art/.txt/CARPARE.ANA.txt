15,01     HAVING PARENTS
15,01     --------------

15,01Ok...I'm still living at home, as most of you nerds.  Now, I'm sure many of you
15,01have wondered "HOW THE HELL AM I GONNA PULL OFF THAT CARDED 20 MEGGER?" I know
15,01damn well that some of you have parents as smart as a fucken tree stump.  But
15,01for intelligent people, like my parents, they aren't gonna fucken believe that
15,01the carded hard drive is the modem.  "Yeah, sure mom, it's the modem, remember,
15,01uh when we went to Zooliggerz Department Store and I begged for one?  huh?  do
15,01ya???".  Well, maybe my mother would believe that but it just wouldn't hold
15,01steady with my dad, he's an electrical engineer and works around computers all
15,01the time, you can't say shit like "yeah, uh...  that thing you've never seen
15,01before?  oh...  uh...  that's Jimmies, yeah, he, uh, gave it to me".  I know
15,01that some people do that shit, I got a unidisk from some dude who didn't care,
15,01and my parents believed it too.  Anyways, how do you get away with it?  Well, I
15,01suggest you practice carding small shit, like knives and bb guns and shit.
15,01Also, read as many carding files before you follow any instructions, this is
15,01for the beginner, but I assume that you understand the "basics".  Practice
15,01going and picking them up, small things, your parents usually never notice.  If
15,01your parents never go in your room, then splurge, card yourselves a bunch of
15,01sluts to work you over everyday, but if your mom isn't a yuppie bitch, then
15,01it's gonna be tough....After hours of day dreaming in school, I came across
15,01this method...


15,01    CARDING BIG SHIT AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT
15,01    -----------------------------------------

15,01ok...at this point, before carding ANYTHING.  Tell your parents that you have a
15,01friend in California (or some other far away place, like I live in S.NJ so I
15,01usually say Nebraska or something).  who is starting a computer business in a
15,01local shopping mall.  Tell them months before that you want a 20 meg hard
15,01drive, keep telling them (you'll probably get it for xmas, but you can't wait
15,01that long), in no time, they'll be sick of it.  So you say that the dude is
15,01gonna give you a hard drive as long as you advertise his company on systems all
15,01over the country (if your parents don't know you phreak, then just say
15,01"locally"), for the small price of a hard drive.  You must have a friend set up
15,01in a state far away, in order to really do this.  If your parents do not
15,01believe you, usually they do, but if they don't, give them the number of your
15,01friend (he must sound older, no squeaky voices), and say it is the computer
15,01store in the "mall".  He must answer the phone like this:  "This is the
15,01didly-squat computer store, this is Joe, may I help you?" If your parents start
15,01asking questions, the dude on the other end cannot be nervous, he has to see
15,01the thing through, even in the tough spots.  If your parents buy it, then
15,01you're home free.  Let "Joe" explain to your parents the concept of the deal.
15,01Also, I'd throw in an HST 9600 for good effect, as a "free gift".  But you
15,01don't have to tell them that.  You can only pull this off once, unless you have
15,01ultra-stupid parents.  But i'd cash in real good cuz you cannot use this as
15,01much as you'd like to.  If your parents work, then you do not have to worry,
15,01card everything as usual, and go pick it up at the drop site.  If your dad
15,01works, and your mom doesn't.  Go outside and ride your bike (how cute),
15,01skateboard, work on your car, kill dogs, spray paint the road, etc.  anything,
15,01as long as you're in front of your house, and your mother knows it.  Go pick up
15,01the shit, and goto your mother (who's probably in the kitchen, heh.) and say
15,01"oh goodie, look what just came!  Hot dog!  The nice UPS man just delivered
15,01it!" and open it, and say "hey look, a 9600 baud modem!  wow!" and got to your
15,01room (where the computer is, unless you keep it in the family room..ha) and set
15,01it up.  That's it!  It works, and it is very sensible.  If you have any
