15,01Neverland


00,01Here we are,
00,01Back again...
00,01To this land of deadend holes-
00,01The songs we sang,
00,01The hours above us hang,
00,01To the song and dance of a new age,
00,01Who gives a damn about us now?-

00,01In those tranquil days,
00,01Those beaten down,
00,01Dragged in and out days...
00,01One too many bowls of time,
00,01Have left me searching for a revolution
00,01That no longer exists-

00,01I have succumbed the mountains
00,01To see the sea,
00,01Only to be pushed down again,
00,01Face to the sky,
00,01Break down a thousandth night,
00,01Break down to tears,
00,01Break down and cry over the remains of
15,01         00these days,
00,01In broken verses...
00,01Hiding beneath the eye of Horous-

00,01In time from time,
00,01I can find a time...
00,01Where I can be seduced from living...
00,01But if it's time we are ment to shadow
00,01Over the portals of a neverland,
00,01Killing from time from time,
00,01Can't be too bad-

00,01So...
00,01Pour yet another,
00,01We as friends,
00,01Yes! We as friends,
00,01Will talk as friends,
00,01And as time whispers us through sleep,
00,01Someday...
00,01We'll be strangers on a strange street-
