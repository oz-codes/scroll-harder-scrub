15,01running on. letting it flow.
15,01shit.
15,01shit.
15,01flow.
15,01consume the good parts.
15,01shit out the rest.
15,01see what's in your shit.
15,01see what you reject.
15,01search the fecal material
15,01for answers.

15,01things is.
15,01thing is.
15,01blocking out
15,01other people's shit
15,01is not always healthy.

15,01it's natural to excrete.
15,01ideas. thoughts. emotions. love.
15,01but shit also has
15,01a
15,01place you know.
15,01you know? you knew.

15,01this media can also be a toilet you once will learn.

15,01and we spew and spew.

15,01my older messages
15,01were vomit.

15,01just couldn't
15,01didn't want to
15,01hold it down.

15,01all the bile.
15,01the strong stench.
15,01just ripped through my head as I
15,01vomitted
15,01all over our growing
15,01circle.

15,01you know what's cool ?
15,01sometimes just the smell of vomit is enough
15,01to make others puke too.
15,01and this circle
15,01became a receptacle
15,01as we all took turns.

15,01now it seems that material
15,01has past through you.
15,01much time has gone.
15,01it is not vomit.. too old.
15,01all the nutrients were taken out.

15,01well.. most of them.
15,01I found some nuggets
15,01things that help you grow
15,01in your pile.

15,01I hope you understand
15,01that sitting on the toilet
15,01though it can feel good
15,01can eat up too much time...
15,01it can prevent others
15,01from shitting.

15,01let others in..
15,01finish your sentences.
15,01wipe your ass.
