15,01Betrayed

15,01I thought we were all friends,
15,01No--more than friends,
15,01Like a close-knit team
15,01None complete without the rest--

15,01But I was wrong

15,01I had worked long hours
15,01The motivation was but to please,
15,01My toil and determination mingling
15,01with my blood and sweat

15,01But they thanked me little
15,01Nodded sparsely in my direction
15,01Their contribution trivial, even nothing at all
15,01Death's web loomed large above us

15,01As the black widow lowered itself
15,01Slowly, not to draw attention,
15,01We refused to acknowledge it
15,01Could not recognize death

15,01I cannot help feeling betrayed
15,01Yet past deeds spoiled can be remade
15,01The venemous spider can yet be slain
15,01It is a simple thing to ask

15,01One so easy it is ironic,
15,01ironic that all refuse to accept the task...
