15,01What is love
15,01if not an emotion
15,01What is love
15,01if not lasting devotion?

15,01What of love for me
15,01I've givin all That I am
15,01What of love for me
15,01I've done all that I can.

15,01You've made me see
15,01That I'm not alone
15,01You've made me see
15,01I'm not the only one.

15,01My heart's beat changes
15,01whenever your around
15,01My heart's beat changes
15,01And I feel bound.

15,01You've opened a portal
15,01In which I finde happiness
15,01You've opened a portal
15,01with just one kiss.

15,01Can I see you
15,01All of the time
15,01Can I see you
15,01heart bound to mine.
