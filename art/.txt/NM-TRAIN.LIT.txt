15,01Note From Wyvern:  I just happened to be newscanning messages on one of the
15,01                   oh so cool boards in my local area and happened upon this
15,01                   little piece of idioticism from a fellow THC Member,
15,01                   Neuromancer.  I enjoyed it so much I just had to add it
15,01                   to the pack.  :)

15,01F> Whatever floats your boat! :)

15,01my boat doesn't float...  hey, last saturday, when i came into taco bell, i
15,01was thinking, and then my friend said something to me, and i said "hey, you
15,01interrupted my train of thought", and then i got thinking... what does my
15,01train of thought look like?  well, i thought about it, and it looks like an
15,01old locamotive, and it uses uncle ben's converted rice for fuel instead of
15,01coal, it's about 3 feet long, and has french poodles hanging off the sides
15,01on fishing poles.  parts of it fade in and out of existence, to reappear in
15,01other places on the train.  it doesn't travel by moving forward, but by
15,01changing it's colour, and shifting left to reality.   yeah, i thought "wow,
15,01i've gotta build this train", and went and got a chicken soft taco.
