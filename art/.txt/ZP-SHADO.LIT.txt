15,01Deep black shadows
15,01Caressing your face
15,01As we travel
15,01Hopeless, hopeless
15,01On our quest.

15,01I can't remember where
15,01I don't want to
15,01I don't really care.

15,01Red, blue, purble, orange silhouettes
15,01Chasing each other
15,01Through starry nights
15,01In your magnificent eyes
15,01Catching moonbeams
15,01Of blissful joy
15,01In the cold rain.

15,01How far we have come
15,01I do not know
15,01It won't matter
15,01When we're done.

15,01Pupeteers toying
15,01With the minds of babes
15,01Controlling everything
15,01Controlling nothing 
15,01But hard-wood figurines
15,01Turning and twisting them
15,01To their will
15,01Stringless we are
15,01But controlled nonetheless
15,01By hands called many things
15,01Subconcious, emotion, devotion, intellect.
