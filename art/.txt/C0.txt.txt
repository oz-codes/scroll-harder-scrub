15,01   Hello, and welcome to Masterpiece Theatre. I, Alistair Crawley, will be
15,01your host for the evening. No. Wait a sec. 
15,01Yeah, sorry, wrong opening speech. I like surreal stuff like that, though.
15,01So sue me. 
15,01   Okay, hi, I'm c0unt zer0, and I'll be your host for the duration of this
15,01little thing that I'm writing.
15,01   First of all. You may be wondering what I'm doing here. Well, I had a 
15,01whole lot of ansi just lying around, 'cause I haven't been releasing under
15,01any groups for the past couple of months, so I talked to pC, and I said to
15,01him, "pC, my man, would you mind if I released this stuff with TWiSTED,
15,01even though I'm not in the group anymore?"
15,01   And HE said, "c0, my man, you're a god. Of course. We would be greatly
15,01honoured to have you release your stuff with us."
15,01   Well, maybe he didn't use EXACTLY those words. But that was the gist of
15,01what he said, OKAY?! So here I am, releasing stuff with TWiSTED once more. 
15,01And that, basically, is the story of why I am here. So now that I've done
15,01with the explanations, I suppose I can get on to the fun part. GREETZ!!
15,01Haven't done THESE in awhile.

15,01Boy, that didn't take to long. I guess that since all the FUCKING ART BOARDS
15,01in my area shut down, I don't have anybody to give greetz to anymore. I think
15,01I'm gonna cry. No, really. I'm crying right now, I swear it.
15,01   Ah well. Anyways, that's about it for now. Oh yeah, I'd just
15,01like to take this opportunity to thank my mom for making me what I am today,
15,01and to say goodbye, once again, to the 9o5 art scene, 'cause I'm gonna 
15,01be going to University at Waterloo come autumn. So maybe I'll release
15,01something in august. But if not, buh-bye!!
