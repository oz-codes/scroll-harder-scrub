15,01Hi.  This is 00Flight15 writing.  This is just a short, 00last-minute note15 to
15,01apologise for the abnormally low content of the pack.  We've had some big
15,01mess-ups this month, and unfortunatly, it does sorta show.  some of our 
15,01members lost touch, 00Dislogic's15 computer exploded or something, and every 
15,01artist suddenly found a life on tuesday nights.  In other words, things
15,01were a bit 00odd 15this month.

15,01So, although the work in the pack is good, there isn't so much.  Also, with
15,01dislogic having bigass pooter problems and upgrading/getting another node for
15,01his board and stuff, he won't be around.  Which means that I'm going to be
15,01doing his job while he's 00gone15 in addition to drawing - which meant that the
15,01pack was a bit rushed.  ... But all that doesn't matter.  The pack is still
15,01actually pretty 00damn good15.  WERD!)*&$@)(!!!

15,01Either way, we're sorry if the pack isn't as good as last month's, but it
15,01couldn't be helped.  We still rule though. 00 DON'T YOU DARE FORGET THAT, BITZ!

15,01Later.
