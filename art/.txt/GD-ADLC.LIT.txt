00,01A Day in the Life of a Conman:

00,01as the moon and clouds melt away
00,01sun rises to stake her claim
00,01for dawn she has broken the day
00,01forever hers shes now tame

00,01old merchantman tries to refrain
00,01can't swindle the swindler or so i'm told
00,01old mind not quite as sane
00,01drunken misgivens now been sold

00,01porters pocket picked so neat
00,01bells forget to toll forget to wed
00,01diamond gold quickly pawned on the street
00,01drunken stomach not quite fed

00,01blue boy with hungry eyes
00,01peace-bringer without a mind
00,01judicious jury until he's one of the guys
00,01friend flies by blue boys in a bind

00,01starve the chicken to be sold
00,01drink to the maddened mob
00,01time to weigh in the poisoned gold
00,01dreams conned ready to sob

00,01so the clouds bring back the rain
00,01darkness looms over the doomed
00,01all in a day under evils reign
00,01conman's life has been finely tuned
