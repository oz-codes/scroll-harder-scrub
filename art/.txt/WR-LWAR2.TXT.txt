15,01        Dawn rose over the dry desert town that Omi Skywalker called
15,01home.  Drifting slowly back from his dream, he rolled over in bed to
15,01find himself tenderly stroking B0ar3P0.  "What the @#$@?!  What are 
15,01you doing in here?  A was having such a great dream about the 
15,01princess."
15,01        "Well, master Skywalker, you ARE a master of my system...if 
15,01you know what my poorly compiled and humble self is attempting to imply
15,01oh so vaguely." B0ar3P0 sighed suggestively.
15,01        "That's it, if you're gonna talk like a WinBitch (tm), then i'm
15,01gonna beat you like a WinBitch (tm)."  Omi was clearly not impressed.

15,01        "Might I suggest, sir" B0ar3P0 interrupted, "that we hurry to 
15,01your landspeeder and track down G0at2D2 before he gets himself in real
15,01trouble."
15,01        "You mean my new Range Rover?  Okay, let's find the little 
15,01bastard before old Whod gets his hands on him.  There are rumours that 
15,01he...does things...to unsuspecting bots."
15,01        "That would indeed be unfortunate.  I still have not finished 
15,01punishing him.  But that's another story."

15,01<<CUT SCENE>>
15,01        Instead of me describing it, go grab a MatchBox toy car and 
15,01roll it back and forth along the front of the keyboard, yelling "VROOM 
15,01VROOM!" loud enough so that the neighbours hear you and call the cops.
15,01<<END CUTSCENE>>

15,01        Princess Kaleia found herself onboard of Darth Balmer's 
15,01flagship, the 'TouchMeI'mFeelingSexy'.  Balmer came forward to inspect
15,01his prisoner.
15,01        "Very nice, but there will be time for that later.  WHERE is 
15,01the rebel base?"
15,01        "I'LL NEVER TELL YOU!" Kaleia screamed at Balmer and the 
15,01StoonTroopers. "Torture me as you wish, but i will never divulge the 
15,01location of the secret rebel base."
15,01        "I can respect that." Darth Balmer chuckled.  He turned to the 
15,01StoonTroopers.  "Bring me 3 hours of motivational speeches by our 
15,01esteemed Emperor Gates!"
15,01        "The base is on Dantooine." Kaleia quickly stated.
15,01        "Dantooine?  I know not this place."
15,01        "Monkey-ass, perhaps you better know it as San Jose" she spat.
15,01        "Excellent.  Bridge, set a course for San Jose."
15,01        "Yes sir" came the call from the bridge. "we just have to make 
15,01a quick stop at a Chevron to gas up, and so that Lloyd can take a 
15,01whiz."
15,01        "DAMMIT!" Darth bellowed.  " I TOLD Lloyd not to get that 
15,01slurpee at the Galactic MiniMall."



15,01and so ends this section of the story.  Kinda short, but that's what 
15,01happens when you accidentally erase a file.  So i patched this together
15,01fairly quick.  a final product should arrive on your shelves in the 
15,01next 4-8 years.


15,01                                        ciao.
