15,01         Well it is finally here! The third pack. Well this pack has less
15,01work in it compared to other packs because it is the summer! Well there isn't
15,01much news this month but here it is:

15,01         00114) 15Data Ruckus left Reactor to follow up on some local group. We
15,01            wish him good luck where ever he turns up.

15,01         00214) 15Dark Dante is a new addition to the group. He will be taking Data
15,01            Ruckus's place. Nice to have you aboard.

15,01         00314) 15Enzo decided to make this pack his last pack. So he decided to
15,01            retire. Best of luck to him and his board.


15,01         Reactor has been letting people go to make room for better member's
15,01to join. Right now we need member's. If you would like to join just call
00,01Kasle of Darkness 15at 14(009O814)0058O14-00O8O3 15and apply. No New User Password. Just
15,01leave feedback with your information. We need member's so please apply.

15,01         Reactor is right now looking to merge. We would like to merge
15,01because we need more members. If your group would like to merge please call
15,01either 00Kasle of Darkness 15at 14(009O814)0058O14-00O8O3 15or 00Mirage 15at 14(009O814)003O214-009654 15(Voice)
15,01Reactor would like to keep it's name but will change if we have too.
15,01Every detail in a merge is all up for disscusion.

15,01         Reactor currently is tring to make a net to link all Reactor boards.
15,01If you know how to make a net please call 00Kasle of Darkness15.

15,01         Would the following people call Kasle Of Darkness: Hocus Pokus, Jynx,
15,01and any other Reactor member that hasn't called Kasle of Darkness.

15,01         We are currently looking for Distro sites still so if you want to be
15,01one please call Kasle of Darkness. Also we are accepting merge offers.

15,01         That about raps it up for this month. Hopefully by next pack Reactor
15,01will either have merged with another group or have it's own net. Maybe both.
