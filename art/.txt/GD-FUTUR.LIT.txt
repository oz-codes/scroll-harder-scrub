15,01future evil

15,01mercy on the rich eating poor
15,01who stand knocking at your door
15,01feed them something for a chore
15,01bleed them for a little more

15,01got to get what you can
15,01before all the shit hits the fan
15,01so this is where you ran
15,01when your ass was frying in the pan

15,01were you safe were you comfy
15,01were the ones you used empty
15,01or have you mended your sanity
15,01broken you thoughts of simplicity

15,01this is where you mind shall walk
15,01through the gardens in which we balk
15,01and over the fields we will talk
15,01but we must go one in a nice slow walk

15,01controlled maybe but free in the end
15,01this is a hidden rule my unawares friend
15,01one that not even the devil may bend
15,01for the tunnels light we will mend

15,01to find your way in the gloom
15,01ask a man how to reach your tomb
15,01if he answers he is your doom
15,01so run from him and hide in your womb

15,01touch the feathers on old cupid
15,01when will he die from being to stupid
15,01he cant make my dreams quite as lucid
15,01i get blammed but i aint that stupid

15,01so what if i am lost and cant find my way
15,01i can always find a place to stay
15,01not as comfy and not much to pay
15,01these ten cent rooms are fine for today

15,01grateful dead.cia
