15,01   ||                                                                      ||
15,01   ||    Ok Ppl's this is AV's Very First ART PAK! we're hoping you'll     ||
15,01   || enjoy viewing our art as much as we enjoyed making it!               ||
15,01   ||                                                                      ||
15,01   ||    I Guess your wondering just who the hell we are?! :) well i'll    ||
15,01   || fill you in on the details, of members in just a little bit, but     ||
15,01   || first, mey'be a little bit of a story about AV is in order, to sort  ||
15,01   || of bring you upto date as it were. ;)                                ||
15,01   ||                                                                      ||
15,01   ||    The Story so far.                                                 ||
15,01   ||    AV was formed roughly about 2-3 months ago, just after the failure||
15,01   || of my first "art group" called flare.  Due to some disagreements with||
15,01   || the other "founder" so that group consisting of 3 members, was broken||
15,01   || up and nothing was done for a short period of time (about 4-5 weeks) ||
15,01   || during that time i decided to get into the SysOp scene, and run a BBS||
15,01   || so thats just what i did, at the same time i was still doing a lot of||
15,01   || vga stuff, etc and was still in contact with one of the other        ||
15,01   || Ex-flare ppl.  After the start of the BBS i decided to go out on my  ||
15,01   || own in the art scene, i believed i had suficient enough drawing      ||
15,01   || ability to do some decent work that might be of use to someone out   ||
15,01   || there, so i decided to get myself a new working name, and start on   ||
15,01   || doing some real gfx work.  At that time i got in touch with one of   ||
15,01   || the other Ex-flare ppl, and got him on side as senior member of an   ||
15,01   || as of yet un-organised art group. Anyway to cut an extreemly long and||
15,01   || boring story short, i gathered up a handfull of ppl who had potential||
15,01   || into my group and then we got out art together in this pak that you  ||
15,01   || you see before you!  We all worked extreemly hard for the short time ||
15,01   || we had before the release of this pak, and even tho its late, i think||
15,01   || it was well worth waiting for!  from now on we'll be releasing paks  ||
15,01   || on a monthly basis, which will include: VGA's, ANSi's, LIT's. we're  ||
15,01   || trying to get into RIP & Music, but as yet dont have any musicians.  ||
15,01   ||   OK so thats basicly it. we came out of obscurity and made a show on||
15,01   || the international ART scene, and we did it all in the space of 2     ||
15,01   || months! i dont know if thats any real feat or not but i believe it is||
15,01   || quite an achievement for us, and i think you'll see a lot more of AV ||
15,01   || Here and there! :)                                                   ||

15,01   ||                                                                      ||
15,01   ||PS. i'd like to see the OZ art scene take off, and get to an          ||
15,01   ||international level, and with groups like DiE and SKAG we're well on  ||
15,01   ||the way to getting there!                                             ||
