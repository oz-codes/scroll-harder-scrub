15,011.  Howdy hey folks, this is Ronin here giving you an update on what is 
15,01    happening (or not happening) with literature.  

15,01    a.  For starters, Phoenix Hawk has been removed from the lit section of 
15,01        iCE for plagiarism.  He confessed to stealing a poem from a school
15,01        literary magazine and putting his name on it.  It was released in the
15,01        February '94 pack.

15,01    b.  I'm sure you've noticed that no lit has been released these last few
15,01        onths, there are a couple simple explanations.  For starters, Syntax
15,01        Error and I had a talk and decided to restructure the way lit is 
15,01        released in iCE, starting soon all lit will be released as part of an
15,01        ansi.  Secondly, very little lit has been produed by myself and the
15,01        other writers.  Lastly, because of numerous computer problems and a 
15,01        lack of interest in the scene I haven't been doing much in the way of
15,01        directing.  

15,01    c.  Shaggy is gay.

15,01    That's about it, take care everyone.
