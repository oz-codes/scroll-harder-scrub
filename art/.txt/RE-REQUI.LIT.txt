15,01Alas, you poor forgoten child,
15,01Abandonned, helpless in the wild,
15,01Your bearers gave your life no thought,
15,01It's their own fault - Yet they care not,
15,01    No Gods, no Seers
15,01    Can quell your fears
15,01Or pains as you unjustly rot,

15,01Alas, you sad and beaten wife,
15,01Deserve this not, in death or life,
15,01No love you live, nor words you say,
15,01Will any of his beatings sway,
15,01    But so estranged
15,01    You hope he's changed
15,01So foolishly you won't away,

15,01Alas, you disillusioned girl,
15,01Afraid to show your face the world,
15,01So soft the touch, so sweet the kiss,
15,01Your white and powd'ry, deadly bliss,
15,01    Alerts you spur,
15,01    It's safe you're sure,
15,01And from your grave no one you'll miss,

15,01Alas, inebriate, allow,
15,01The bottle is your home for now,
15,01So simple then to start at first,
15,01Now no amount can quench your thirst,
15,01    Oh to begin
15,01    To start again
15,01For now you know you're at your worst,

15,01Alas, poor boy, so fleet of heart,
15,01You loved her from the very start,
15,01You felt you were her life-long mate,
15,01And yet, she'd been withdrawn of late,
15,01    But it's all right,
15,01    You've seen the light,
15,01This cliff will be your new found fate,

15,01Alas, unhappy little elf,
15,01You sold your soul, now sell yourself,
15,01He sweetened you as if his bride,
15,01Now makes you give your very hide,
15,01    Now pray above,
15,01    You want some love,
15,01But scared to let a thing inside,

15,01Alas you lonely millionaire,
15,01You've made it rich, but life's not fair,
15,01You wanted just to prove yourself,
15,01And now they only want your wealth,
15,01    To be, to be,
15,01    No love you see,
15,01So raise your gun in toast to health,

15,01Alas myself, alas, alas,
15,01See worlds through a looking glass,
15,01At some I laugh, at some I scoff,
15,01And always place myself aloft,
15,01    Yet he who points
15,01    Himself anoints,
15,01And thus am I the one worse off?
