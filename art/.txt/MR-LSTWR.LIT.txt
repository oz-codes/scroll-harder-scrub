15,01                00In the sun I feel as one
15,01                00I feel that my work is done
15,01                00But yet so much left unfinished
15,01                00I want to talk a gun and shoot until I am daminished
15,01                00I am just so sorry and wasted that I don't deserve to live
15,01                00There is just nothing left for me to give
15,01                00I am so sorry but it is time
15,01                00Time for my last dine
15,01                00I must now go
15,01                00I must go deep and hide
15,01                00It isn't my fault
15,01                00I just feel caught
15,01                00So I say my fair wells
15,01                00When I come back? No one can tell
15,01                00Don't bother to calling
15,01                00I'll just be in a horrible place balling
15,01                00My chances of living is a slim five percent
15,01                00This is my last and final Primal Decent.
