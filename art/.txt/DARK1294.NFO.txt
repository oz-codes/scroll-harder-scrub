15,01              If you only knew the power of the Dark side......--------

15,01  Welcome to Dark's 6th pack!  6 - Dark.... hrmmm is there a connection
15,01here?  Well it's been 3 months since our last release, ya ya I've heard
15,01people talking; "Is Dark dead?!?"  Actually, we're not (as you can see).
15,01The reason we waited three months oppose to our regular two month thingy is
15,01because of three reasons; One we wanted to get get back on track for our 1
15,01year anniversary coming up in February 1995.  Two, we wanted to let the members
15,01adjust back to that horrible school life... yuk!  And three, why the fuck do
15,01we need a reason? :)

15,01  Well (I keeping saying this), this is Dark's best pack to date, so be
15,01happy you downloaded it, it's worth every byte :)  You'll find a most
15,01excellent viewer in this pack... it's got a few bugs (like giving Acidic Soap's
15,01chick a beard) but take it for what it is, it's totally from scratch.
15,01PS: If you don't want to read the DARKVIEW.DOC and want to find out how
15,01to use Darkview with the Text interface, use DARKVIEW -IT from the 
15,01command line.

15,01Anyways, prepare to cream yourself once again!

15,01-----[ Filenames ]-----------------------------------------------------

15,01The Dark files are still named as follows:


15,01                              XXXXX-##.DRK

15,01XXXXX  represents five characters  for artist name.  ## is a hexadecimal
15,01number representing the number of releases that artist has made to date.
15,01This file naming system is working out just fine for us and hopefully
15,01other groups may find this new method useful with getting rid of the
15,01multiple alias conflicts.
