15,01                              "Broken Vision"
15,01                               
15,01                               Denial of hope
15,01                          For long sought out fame
15,01                            Relentless repression
15,01                            Of humility 'n shame
15,01                            Speechless he moves,
15,01                           No wants and no needs.
15,01                             Dreaming she soars
15,01                          Through beams of sunlight.
15,01                             Wanted for nothing 
15,01                           Searching for the same
15,01                             Both growing tired 
15,01                           Of life's little games.

15,01                             One will move on
15,01                           And the other just miss
15,01                        The life that could have been
15,01                            Started with a kiss.
15,01                          No guide to the stars
15,01                            No handbook of life
15,01                             Both will suffer
15,01                             And gain nothing
15,01                          But a walk in the rain.
