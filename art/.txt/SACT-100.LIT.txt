15,01The facts are well known.
15,01Chewing the gristle of 
15,01Rumors and lies
15,01The rays don't peirce
15,01this Stained-glass silence.

15,01With a toothpick I extract
15,01a mass of flasehood's arteries.
15,01Flicking it, with contempt, over my shoulder (left)
15,01I continue my eighty thousand rosaries

15,01Bead whisper and beat
15,01At a rote-string of heresies
15,01Living and screaming under my fingers
15,01Arched towards dust-waltzed light.

15,01Motes of truth in reality's air dance through me
15,01as viscerae are removed from my over-eager bite.
15,01Such persistant interruptions

15,01The flesh chokes and convulses
15,01Around the feathered grains
15,01Such feeble and contrary fuel
15,01For the marrow of the soul.

15,01Hail Mary, full of grace and...what is this?
15,01Hack hack, I say, followed by a lung
15,01or is it a kidney? filthy, regardless,
15,01tumbling to the constant cobbles.

15,01The stone hands reach out to receive
15,01My offering. Orbs roll god-ward
15,01Ecstacy in marble
15,01The blood dripping on their feet.

15,01toes buffed from countless pleas for luck,
15,01revenge, fertility. A nameless monk
15,01shuffles forward, trembling,
15,01places the organ in a wooden box.
15,01Engraved skulls and toads 
15,01it is put in an alcove, where a guttering candle,
15,01soft and tallow,
15,01burns for the soul of thr truth.

15,01Now they come
15,01To lay out their need
15,01Into the face of mystery
15,01Dusty pilgrim prayers to
15,01The innards of
15,01    A new sort of saint.

15,01Mysterious martyr
15,01my body is cast out, reviled,
15,01while my organ is sanctified,
15,01revered. It knows adulation
15,01while I learn of excommunication

15,01Choice cuts
15,01held on high
15,01While the leftover flesh
15,01Writhes in denial.

15,01At long last my thick tongue curls
15,01in confession
15,01to my own ear.
15,01The rest, dust coated from the warm, sticky blood
15,01traces the outline of a new whirlwind of faith.
