15,01  1.    Hey whats up, Metal Head here.  Putting together the iCEPACK.
15,01      Let's see what's been going on this month ...

15,01  2.    In the way of ANSI there is a bit of news concerning members.
15,01      The biggest news is of course the fact that 5 canadians left the
15,01      group to start another one that now goes by the name Gotic.  We
15,01      are, of course, dissapointed to see them go, but at some point maybe
15,01      they will be back.  Have fun guys.. :)
15,01        The 5 were: Elminster, Golgotha, Lord Carnuss, Random Violence, &
15,01      The Retarded Warrior.

15,01  3.    As people leave, people also join, our newest ANSI members are:
15,01      Special Ed.. Just up from iCE Trial.  On the road to greatness :)
15,01      RipTide.. New Trial Member.. Probably soon will be full iCE.
15,01      Cool-T..  He's back and has a wicked ansi out for this month.
15,01      G-Man..  Formerly of TRiBE has now joined iCE.
15,01      Also, Joker has finnaly released another ansi.. Yeaaaaaah!

15,01  5.    This month we have the addition of 2 new .MOD composers, Necros &
15,01      Psychnosis.  The later, Psychnosis, is out newest VGA director.
15,01      These two make up a good part of the pack with the .MOD's released,
15,01      definatly worth it though...

15,01  6.    And the last new member is Par-Salian, an addition to the literature
15,01      division.

15,01  7.    And also Sanctuary(tm) has gone down, will it go back up?  Who
15,01      knows.. :)

15,01  8.    One last thing, yes the iCEPACK is over one disk, and i'm sorry about
15,01      that, because it is also too small to split into two disks.  So let
15,01      me offer a solution.  The file MS-MELT1.ZIP is what puts the pack over
15,01      one disk.  So just take that out of the zip and store it on a separae 
15,01      disk if you liek to store things.  
15,01                                         
15,01  9.    Unfortunatly this is a second release of this November '93 iCEPACK.
15,01      This release was made because the origonal was infected by a virus. 
15,01      Even though the virus (PS-MPC, Phalcolm/Skism Mass-Production Virus) 
15,01      is relaltively harmless, people get spooked by virus' so this pack is
15,01      cleaned of the virus, and SCAN.EXE is included for you to scan your
15,01      hard drive.  Sorry for any inconvenience...
