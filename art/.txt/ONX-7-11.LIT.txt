15,01I ran outside. 2 shells left. I called to Jill and the cops to run.
15,01I didn't think they could, until who should appear, but MURPHY the dog!
15,01Murphy dragged the incapacitated cops to safety! Good dog!
15,01I just got off one of the more interesting shifts in my all-too-long
15,01I prayed that the ice machine had got eddie good and I could make it look
15,01cold.. but maybe it won't matter. He soon was outside as well, and beganrk,
15,01crossing the parking lot, through the gas pumps, to get at me.eave, and
15,01mutters: fiction, and nonsensical blithering. You will be warned as to which
15,01I unloaded my second last shell at my target. Nothing happened, and he
15,01continued towards me. I fired again at my target. The gas pump.

15,01to be watching him, as to make eddie think I was a little busy. He disengaged
15,01the hand hold, and started out, after I helped him pick up his smokes.

15,01black lab enters the store, takes a quick tour, then come right up behind the
15,01tills, and lays down.
15,01Back on topic. I was marking down the nightly write-offs, when Jill
15,01"uhm... hi. Shoo. Or something."er. We watched as he calmly got in his car,
15,01and drove off without paying. We calmly took down his plate.
15,01Well, I couldn't resist this ole girl, she looked just like the dog I had.
15,01After dealing with the customers, who all had either an idea of what to do
15,01with it, or an story on where it came from, I went to check the tag.*******

15,01Of course, murphy, as it turns out, thought this was play. Ok, I had fun.
15,01I like dogs, I just can't have one where I live. I sneak a peek at the tag,
15,01and copy down the phone number.

15,01It was a bit after midnight, so i took the chance of calling the number.
15,01I got the machine at first, but someone picked up.
15,01"uh, hi.."hat at the 7-e,
15,01"hi, are you missing a large black dog?"
15,01<pause> where they heard that from,
15,01"hm.. looks that way."
15,01"well, she's waiting at the 7-11 at lougheed and laity."
15,01"oh geez. Thanks. I'll be right there."
15,01Gee ma, i wanna go home!
15,01I thought It might be better to get murphy outside, but at the time, I didn't
15,01know her name, and the usual doggy coaxes wern't working. I went over to the
15,01write offs I'd checked off into the book, and pulled out some packaged ham.
15,01Peeling back the wrap, I knew murphy's attention was mine. I walked to the
15,01front door, and put down a slice. Murphy's nose went down, and immidiatly
15,01came back up. The ham was gone. I'd forgotten how fast dogs can eat. I don't
15,01think there was any chewing involved.
15,01Gee ma, i wanna go home!
15,01I brought her outside, and one by one, tossed the ham slices into the air,
15,01for her to catch. She only missed one. I used to play that a lot with my
15,01dog, way back when. When the ham was gone, the only proof that would satisfy
15,01murphy was to let her inspect the wrapper, which of course had to be licked
15,01clean of any residual flavor. I tried to sneak back in without her, but she
15,01wormed her way past. Another canine skill I'd forgotten. But I didn't really
15,01care. It looked to the security camera like I tried, but I liked the extra
15,01company. On a normal shift, all of this would have been impossible, but like
15,01I said at the beginning, it was an unusually quiet shift. I punched in the
15,01order for the sandwiches, while talking to murphy, who sat behind the counter,
15,01and made the odd dog-yawn noise. Luckily, dogs are short enought not to be
15,01seen behind the counter by the camera. saw his standing at the door, yelling
15,01various swear phrases. I passed by, and went inside, to where mohan, a fellow
15,01Soon enough, a regular showed up, and took murphy home. Owell. The manager
15,01would never let me keep her anyway.d with a nearly bronx accent.
