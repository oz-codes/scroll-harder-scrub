15,01Jihad was first formed as an all VGA group by me and Prime Evil.  We really
15,01didn't have the time for it so we let it die.  Only a few pple got pissed. :>

15,01Recently I've gotten tired with just being a member of other groups so I 
15,01decided to either go free lance or start my own group.  Guess what I did.
15,01Since I already had a name, I decided to pick Jihad back up only allow
15,01any form of art (yes, lit too).  

15,01Jihad is not exclusive, yet anyway.  So I really don't care if you are in, oh
15,01say iCE or ACiD and are also in Jihad.  As long as you put out one decent work
15,01a month or so, I'll keep you in.  Sound fair?  I know it does.
