15,01 (excuse the short lines; the pad of paper was narrow)


15,01 I watched some all-american tv tonight:


15,0121 minutes with LAPD on channel 35


15,01on your tv
15,01deep L.A.
15,01rebounds off satellites:

15,01church doors
15,01alarmed and linked
15,01are & arm with the Law

15,01father pulled over
15,01carrying marijuana.
15,01policeman yanks him out,
15,01shakes hands with the backseat children
15,01    - I thought daddy quit
15,01    - hey kid, give my badge five

15,01what the FOX in Const. Smitty's uniform
15,01wants us to see:
15,01that white faces are honest,
15,01reared on pork chops and butter.
15,01the black ones need a blue sponge,
15,01a good clubbing 
15,01and humiliation on national tv

15,01they do it all in seven minute segments,
15,01on car hoods, car trunks.
15,01flashlight peeling layers of face
15,01then punching same question over:

15,01   who are you?
15,01   who are you?
15,01   who are you?

15,01what's your real name?
15,01legs spread on the road for speeding
15,01hair pulled for pipe possession

15,01cocked gun up the nose
15,01  answer me. answer me.
15,01(will they shoot live?)

15,01handcuffs chew a thousand wrists
15,01batons already blunt

15,01coffee, boys, after the credits?
