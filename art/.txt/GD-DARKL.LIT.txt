15,01darkened light

15,01something broke when i gazed after you
15,01you were not really there like a missing shoe
15,01i fumbled around and looked everywhere
15,01but nothing nothing in this lifeless air

15,01you have dissapeared from my world
15,01into another you must have meld
15,01but i am at a loss hidden in my grief
15,01you stealing my sould like a heartless thief

15,01i try and hold on cannot let go
15,01but then i realize just how low i can go
15,01deeper and deeper i sink within
15,01withdrawn trying to find the answer to win

15,01i feel as if nothings left in this lifeless sin
15,01sabotage created by something smaller than a pin
15,01how can you leave this pathetic soul
15,01and force it to go through a private hell

15,01but its your choice that you chose
15,01your inner voice was behind the hose
15,01that doused our fire burning bright
15,01into this life without anymore light

15,01grateful dead.raid'94
