15,0130 THINGS TO DO ON AN EXAM WHEN YOU 
15,01KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO FAIL IT ANYWAY
15,01===================================

15,011. Get a copy of the exam, run out screaming,
15,01"Andre, Andre, I've got the secret documents!"

15,012. Talk the entire way through the exam. Read questions
15,01aloud, debate your answers with yourself out loud. If 
15,01asked to stop, yell out, "I'm SOOOO sure you can hear
15,01me thinking" Then start talking about what a jerk the 
15,01instructor is.

15,013. Bring a Game Boy. Play with the volume at max level.

15,014. On the answer sheet, find a new, interesting way to 
15,01refuse to answer every question. For example: I refuse
15,01to answer this question on the grounds that it conflilcts
15,01with my religious beliefs. Be creative.

15,015. Run into the exam room looking about frantically. Breathe
15,01a sigh of relief. Go to the instructor, say "They've found me,
15,01I have to leave the country" and run off.

15,016. Fifteen minutes into the exam, stand up, rip up all the 
15,01papers into tiny pieces, throw them in the air and
15,01yell out "Merry Christmas" If you're really daring, ask
15,01for another exam. Say you lost the first one. Repeat this
15,01process every 15 minutes.

15,017. Come into the exam wearing slippers, a bathrobe, a towel
15,01on your head, and nothing else.

15,018. Come down with a BAD case of Turet's Syndrome during the 
15,01exam. Be as vulgar as possible.

15,019. Bring things to throw at the instructor when she's not 
15,01looking. Blame it on the person nearest to you.

15,0110. As soon as the instructor hands you the exam, eat it.

15,0111. Every 5 minutes, stand up, collect your things, move to 
15,01another seat, continue the exam.

15,0112. Turn in the exam after 30 minutes. As you walk out, comment
15,01on how easy it was.

15,0113. Get the exam. 20 minutes into it, throw your papers down
15,01violently, scream out, "Fuck this!" and walk out triumphantly.

15,0114. Arrange a protest before the exam starts (ie. Threaten 
15,01the instructor that whether or not everyone is done, they are 
15,01all leaving after one hour to go drinking).

15,0115. Show up completely drunk. (Completely drunk means that
15,01at some point during the exam, you should start crying
15,01for mommy.)

15,0116. Comment on how sexy the instructor is looking that day.

15,0117. Come to the exam wearing a black cloak. After about 30
15,01minutes, put on a white mask and start yelling "I'm here, 
15,01the phantom of the opera!" until they drag you away.

15,0118. If the exam is math/science related, make up the longest 
15,01proofs you could possibly think of. Get pi and imaginary 
15,01numbers into most equations. If it is written, relate 
15,01everything to your own life story.

15,0119. Try to get the people in the room to do the wave.

15,0120. Bring some large, cumbersome, ugly idol. Put it right
15,01next to you. Pray to it often. Consider a small sacrifice.

15,0121. During the exam, take apart everything around you.
15,01Tables, chairs, anything you can reach.

15,0122. Puke into your exam booklet. Hand it in. Leave.

15,0123. Take 6 packs of rice cakes to the exam. Stuff at least
