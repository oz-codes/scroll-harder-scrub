15,01+==========================================+lti-purpose File Viewer

15,01    In a DOS Shell, certain programs may conflict with ForceView/2. Files
15,01  most likely not to work in a DOS shell are those that have high memory
15,01  requirements. The same is true of spawning (running) EXE and COM files
