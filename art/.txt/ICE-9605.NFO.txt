15,011.  Another month, another pack. :)  We've decided to try to get this pack
15,01    out at the beginning of the month and bite the bullet with all the artists
15,01    who needed thier typical day or two to finish thier artwork... The size
15,01    might not be what we're accustomed to releasing, but the change for the
15,01    better can never occur otherwise.

15,012.  Our webpages were officially open to the public on 10:00p on the 15th of
15,01    the month!  That's right, http://www.ice.org is now a reality.  We're
15,01    quite pleased with the outpouring of positive comments we've received,
15,01    and are confident that these pages are the beginning of something
15,01    fantastic for us as a group.  In the first 15 days, we had over 1.5 gigs
15,01    of information transfered to thousands and thousands of new users.
15,01    Congratulations to all those involved in the construction of the page,
15,01    your diligence has made something we can all be truly proud of.

15,013.  The pages.. are HTTP://WWW.ICE.ORG.. repeat.. HTTP://WWW.ICE.ORG.  Is
15,01    this a shameless plug?  Of course not.  We're beyond shame. :)

15,014.  A very warm welcome this month to Annihilatus, Megalith, and Vesalius..
15,01    three VGA artists with very different styles among them.  These three
15,01    fellas will be sure to bring a wealth of high quality VGA artwork for you
15,01    all to enjoy.  In our ansi department, we welcome Dieznyik and his
15,01    wonderfully unique personality and artistic style to the iCE ranks.  He's
15,01    certainly no stranger to attention, and perhaps being among the iCE
15,01    family will focus the world's attention on his artistic skill.  George
15,01    Washington also was summoned back to life from the positive vibes we've
15,01    been exuding, and returns with some old school flair.  Last, but
15,01    certainly not least, we welcome our old friend Cavalier to our memberlist.
15,01    His presence to the group, for those who know him, needs little
15,01    explanation, and we're pleased to have him back oiling our gears.

15,014b. On the flip side, we're sad to mention that Maestro has left the iCE
15,01    ranks to persue some group entitled Quest.  We never truly found out
15,01    what his intents were in doing this, but we wish him the best regardless
15,01    in his endeavors.  In addition, we'd like to pay a quick thanks to Borian,
15,01    who stepped down this month as VGA coordinator.  Needless to say, he
15,01    did an awesome job in this capacity, and our VGA department could be
15,01    nothing but better for the wear because of the input he had.  We
15,01    understand the personal issues that have forced him to devote less time
15,01    to his group stuff, and we look forward to his future pictures with the
15,01    group.  In related news, we'd like to welcome Xten as our new VGA
15,01    coordinator.  His leadership on the webpage as well as his long time
15,01    loyalty to the group's cause makes him a natural replacement for the
15,01    position.  Congratulations!

15,015.  Blunder department!  We made a very big error.  Our apologies to Borian
15,01    for releasing an unfinished picture in last month's pack.  The picture,
15,01    bn-ice6.jpg, even though it looked fantastic as all of Brent's other work
15,01    does, wasn't finished.  Our sincere apologies for this blunder.  We're
15,01    awaiting our wet noodle flogging.

15,016.  NAID:  As of this writing, we just received word that one of our artist
15,01    duos, that of Visigoth and Lintec, was disqualified from the contest.
15,01    Needless to say, we need to find out the whole story as to what happened,
15,01    but from what we understand from Visigoth, the two artists were
15,01    disqualified following the judging process, after thier pic was voted
15,01    overwhelmingingly the best picture by the public.  We send out our support
