15,01TERSE is a tiny (only 4096 bytes) but amazingly powerful full-screen
15,01editor for files of up to 64K in length.  TERSE runs on all PC compatible
15,01machines.  Its command keys are very similar to those of the famous
15,01BRIEF editor (by UnderWare Inc.).  TERSE can edit both UNIX and MS-DOS
15,01style text files as well as binary files.  No hacker's disk is complete
15,01without it.  No disk, be it hard or floppy, is too full to include it.

15,01TERSE is free (but copyrighted) to private users.  If you are a private
15,01user who uses TERSE "for pleasure", you are not required to register.
15,01However, if you use TERSE for any commercial application, i.e., in
15,01your company, at work, etc., or make money from selling software or
15,01distributing shareware, you are *required* to register your copy of TERSE.
15,01Registration cost is only $15 and buys you a personalized version, and
15,01grant your institution a site license.  For an additional payment of 
15,01only $5, you get the source code of TERSE.

15,01Highlights
15,01==========
15,01 o  Very small: fits in 4096 bytes = 4 clusters on 5.25"/3.5" floppies.
15,01 o  Minimal free memory requirements: 137KB.
15,01 o  Uses current screen size, including the most common 80x25 screen
15,01    dimensions but also unusual sizes such as 40x16, 40x25, 40x40,
15,01    40x50, 132x25, 132x43, 96x33, 80x30, 80x33, etc.
15,01 o  Fully DESQview (version 2.0 and above) aware.
15,01 o  Edit binary files. TERSE is ideal for a quick and dirty job
15,01    of editing and patching strings in small programs.
