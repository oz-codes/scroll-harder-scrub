00,01Friendz, loverz, all who have cared
00,01I'd like to take this time to thank you
00,01thank you for when some of you actually were there
00,01for me
00,01thanx for the timez we spent, the laughter shared
00,01and conversationz we've had
00,01But after a while..............ya'll couldn't deal with the shit.....
00,01the shit goin on in my head, heart and soul
00,01abandoned, I just felt so alone, solo
00,01stranded
00,01That'z what finally made me realize 
00,01that life was no longer worth living
00,01I just don't care about anything anymore
00,01everything I've ever cared for is gone
00,01I'm empty...............just a shell
00,01there has got to be more to life then just that.....
00,01being just a shell.....but that'z all I am
00,01and all I'll ever be so just forget me
00,01It truly was a gift that I had what I had
00,01when I had it
00,01But it is all gone
00,01Vanished N Poof N C-ya N Bu-bye
00,01So As my final request I as of you this........
00,01Please, do not mourn my loss
00,01but
00,01Mourn for what I have not yet given to the world
00,01I love you all
00,01May I forever rest in peace....
