15,01  You awaken from a long, dry sleep.  A sleep where nothing pierced you.  You
15,01felt as if something had reached out and swept you away from the life you
15,01lead.  The life.  You open your eyes slowly, reluctant to pursue visions of
15,01reality.  The first thing you notice is that you are outside, out on what
15,01once could be called a plain.  But now, even the ground is desolate.  Your
15,01eyes glance up at the daytime sky, and you feel the scorching pain of a
15,01ozone uninhibited sun as it beams through the purple and blue sky.  The
15,01planet has become defenseless against the terror of the star that was once
15,01its sustenence.  You groan as you attempt to stand up after sleeping on the
15,01mucky grey ground.  Your back feels as if it had been cracked in half.
15,01Standing, you reach into your pocket to grope for a Life-Pill, mankind's only
15,01hope for survival in such a desolate wasteland.  The pill protects people by
15,01rendering the radioactive ultraviolet rays from the sun and other things
15,01harmless.. but at a cost.  You pop the pill into your mouth, and doing so
15,01you notice your skin.  Once perfect and healthy, and now grey, hard, and
15,01scaly.  You purse your lips in grim realization of the being you have become,
15,01and crack them, spewing out a short leak of oozing green unidentified liquid
15,01from the dry cracks.  Science was never able to explain the effects on the
15,01skin or the new oozing molasses like liquids flowing through the body after
15,01the Life-Pill was developed, but always forgot it since mankind SURVIVED.
15,01You survey the terrain around you, and notice there are only two trees.
15,01One to your left, about a speedball rink's distance away, and one in the
15,01smoky isolated horizon to the right.  But before you is the marvel of
15,01modern society.  The fair city Smerol Triph, with its crystal dome deflecting
15,01the blue-orange rays of the sun.  The city inside the crystal is as desolate
15,01looking as the plain surrounding you.  Buildings of grey made of a new
15,01substance invented by science.  On ropes, tram cars move people all dressed
15,01similar to you to their destinations.  You'd think that such a large city
15,01would be bustling.  But while it was busy, it was quiet.  You glance at your
15,01clothes, loathing every square centimetre.  The dark grey hooded cloak makes
15,01you look exactly the same as every other person.  You look at your
15,01CommuniBand, a new type of wristwatch-calculator-television-radio device,
15,01and see that it is 0850.  The military-type time, and military-type everything
15,01is now the rule in your world.  You begin to walk towards the city, your
15,01routine calling you.  But as you take your first soundless step on the
15,01sickly turf you realize why you had left the confines of the city in the
15,01first place.  You were running away.  You recall what had happened the night
15,01before.....


15,01  You stood in what may be reckoned to be a bar, submitting yourself to
15,01the government's latest advances in survival drinks, when one grey cloaked
15,01man came up to you.  He beckoned you to a corner, where he pulled back his
15,01hood.  He was a hideous being.  The face had been worn off, leaving a grey
15,01scaled blob with four small holes stragetically placed to look like eyes
15,01and nostrils, and one large fissure acting as a mouth.  The creature told
15,01you that you had been chosen to finish its job.  The job was to toil in the
15,01sands on the northeast side of Smerol Triph, in the East Desert, which was
15,01once a great ocean.  You knew that this would do the same to you as it did
15,01to this creature, as Life-Pills can't completely protect you from the evils
15,01of the atmosphere without the protection of the crystal dome.  The creature
15,01slaved there for the government looking for salts and deposits that may
15,01be useful in science advances.  You knew no other way out.  You snapped.
15,01You hated science, the government, and everything they stood for.  Hadn't
15,01they learned from their past mistakes??  You didn't want to be LIKE you were
15,01slowly becoming, slower than most everyone else, as slow as the scientists.
15,01And DEFINATELY not like this creature.  Your craze slowly took over your
15,01disentigrating mind.  You grabbed a phaze ray and pumped three pulses into
15,01the creature, annihilating it.  You felt relieved, until the angry hideous
15,01faces of your species turned to you.  The sirens began to whine in the city,
15,01the dreaded Politia was going to come for you.  The Politia was the
15,01new police and militia together.  They were not, however, designed to protect
15,01the people.  Rather, they were well known for their torturous treatment and
15,01slow deaths given to enemies of the government, and general anarchists.
15,01Gaining a last burst of strength, you wildly pushed your way through the mob
15,01and ran out the door, and out of the city.  You ran until you collapsed....

15,01  Now you realize you can never go back.  And you don't want to.  You hate
15,01this new life forced upon you by the greed of the government and its defeated
15,01counterparts.  From a distance, you hear the sirens of the Politia leaving
15,01the city and coming across the dead plain in search of you.  You look behind
15,01you and see, far off, yet another city, alike to Smerol Triph, and know
15,01that if you could reach it, you can be a new person, and hidden forever.
15,01The Politia would leave you alone if you became a new, working person in
15,01another city.  To survive you must run due south.  If you stray southwest
15,01at all, you would fall into the Great Crevasse, which falls into the very
15,01core of the planet.  You begin to trot towards the new city.  But something
15,01makes you stop.  Realizing you can make it gives you no happiness.  You
