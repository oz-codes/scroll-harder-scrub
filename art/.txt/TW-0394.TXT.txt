14,01    11TRiBAL WRiTES - The TRiBE Newsletter - Volumn #1 / Issue #9 - March 1994
11,01 14------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14,01 00#  15March turned out to be "TRiBE: National DooM Month", because most of the
15,01    4o4 guys spent most of the month watching me shove missles down thier
15,01    throat.  (grin)  Big GROUP Hug to the new guys for savin' our ADDiCTed
15,01    butts.  Now we only DooM on the weekends. . .

15,01 00#  15The super secret guy who joined TRiBE last month was, (drum roll provided
15,01    by Dark Deception) Panama Jack, "Formerly of ACiD Productions.", he typed
15,01    in his best RaD MaN impersonation.  PJ simply wanted to hold off on the
15,01    announcement until he had a release.  (Here's hoping there's a release in
15,01    this ZIP, 'cuz I'm not editing this at the last moment.)  He's here now,
15,01    and us TRiBE guys are all simlpy a giddy with excitement that another
15,01    'ANSi Veterian' decided to "go to TRiBE to retire", he typed in his best
15,01    Beastie impersonation.  (And they talk to me about Propoganda?!)
15,01    [Ok: so I had to edit it at the last moment to say that PJ had to go out
15,01    of town at the last second, so look for his ANSi early on in April.]

15,01 00#  15SPEAKING of artists leaving ACiD, Maestro, Jocko and Deeply Disturbed all
15,01    joined TRiBE this month.  Within a few days, Deeply Disturbed and Jocko
15,01    were talked back into re-joining ACiD.  A few days from that, Jocko calls
15,01    us up and says, "Hey, really, I'm still in TRiBE, but this guy wants some
15,01    ANSi from me that he paid for with ACiD on them."  Then at some point in
15,01    time, Jocko joined iCE.  NOW he's reportedly out of the scene.  Days ago
15,01    Deeply Distrubed decided dropping ACiD for TRiBE was definately the
15,01    direction he wanted to go, so the dudes back drawing for TRiBE and working
15,01    on Distorted.  FINALLY- Red Leader came aboard at the last moment ...


15,01 00#  15Maestro's showing everyone out there that a FART (Freehand ART) doesn't
15,01    have to be a TOON (JeD Wanna-Be) to be GOOD, that FART's can be as good
15,01    as any BELCH (Big, Elite, Lovely, Comic Hack).  Too bad ACiD's "Quality
15,01    Control" excluded some of his material, because this is the guy thier
15,01    WDCWC ("We don't copy, we create!") Division has been waiting for!  (You
15,01    know, that ACiD Division that releases Stun Island, Screen Captures from
15,01    other games, iCE ANSi rips (TT/ED/Sand), etc.)

15,01 00#  15Dark Deception had tried to join iCE, but apparenly got the run around.
15,01    Apon finding out that he "could defininately be trial", he came to talk
15,01    with me about it, and decided to stick with TRiBE, the problems resolved.

15,01 00#  15Spirit of Illusion, an Eternity guy that didn't live up to ACiD's "Quality
15,01    Control" joins us his month.  While he's been groupless between then and
15,01    now, he didn't "Pull a Ren Noble" (Aka Being Sunny De-active).

15,01 00#  15A big hidieho goes out to Thanatos who also joins us this month from Nitro
15,01    (which is Maestro's neck of the woods).

15,01 00#  15Another Happy Happy Joy Joy nod goes out to SIDS who comes aboard.  He's
15,01    a guy from a group called MAGiC which merged with another group, Gothic.

15,01 00#  15Gee'z, another one?  Yup.  Zeppelin zips over from iCE, tired of all the
15,01    TRiAL SHiT.  He just got off grounding, so look for his stuff next month.

15,01 00#  15Minor Threat:  Hey, bud, if you've decided to stay with us, could you get
15,01    us a number that works?  The ones we have are all dis-co-nected.

15,01 00#  15Would one of you kind people out there in TRiBE Land, please, please, do
15,01    a new TRiBAL WRiTES logo.  Mr. Man did this before he "got'z" his "skill'z"
15,01    and I've long since ran out of color combinations.  (Hey Joe, kill your bro
15,01    yet?)

15,01 00#  15We're making great StrIDeS on the TV project.  Keep your fingers and toes
15,01    crossed for it's debut next month.  (Pray the libraries come in. . .)
