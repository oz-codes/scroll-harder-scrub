15,01                        Glory and Power, Bitter a Blend
15,01                   Hunger, Starvation, and Death it Will Send
15,01                With Months Lacking Light, And Cold Winter Night
15,01                      Our Hate Will Live on 'Till The End

15,01                   And Then He Will Die, And Justice Will Lie
15,01                          Eternally Sealed By His Fate
15,01                  But Doubts Will Remain, And So Will The Pain
15,01                         Of Living This Anarchy State.
