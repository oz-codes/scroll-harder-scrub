08,01 14------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14,01 00#  15Short month, short on time, so we'll make this as brief and painless as we
15,01    can.  In the "Comings and Goings" catagory this month, Demon's Death came,
15,01    Final Descendant went (to iCE in order to collaborate more effeciently with
15,01    Glenn Danzig on Reflections).  The Calibre, Gothic's Courier Head Honcho
15,01    Dude also joins us to learn what he can about ANSi.  He's still Gothic's
15,01    Courier Head Honcho Dude, he'll just be dabbling with ANSi with us.  We
15,01    welcome our new Super Secret member (you know who you are!).  Next month,
15,01    when he has an ANSi to release, we'll let the rest of you in on who it is,
15,01    as per his wishes.

15,01 00#  15Perfect solution to the entire "review problem" was brought up recently.
15,01    Any magazine wanting to review TRiBE can, with our blessing, as long as
15,01    if they are opperating on a competitive scale, they simply exclude ANY
15,01    scores.  This will effectively keep us out of the competitiveness of the
15,01    whole "review thing", and still allow those individual artists who want
15,01    comments and opinions on thier work to "get thiers".   Using Iridium as
15,01    an example, they give scores, those scores are averaged together, the
15,01    pack then gets a score.  The scores of the various packs are compared,
15,01    one is declaired "the winner".  By NOT giving the TRiBE ANSi's a score,
15,01    but still "reviewing them", everyone should be happy.  Iridium gets to
15,01    add another pack to thier reviews, TRiBE stays OUT of the competition,
15,01    and Minor Threat get's other people's opinion on his work.  The same can
15,01    apply to any magazine which assigns a "value" to the ANSi's, and/or RANKS
15,01    the packs accordingly.  Any magazine that DOES include a competitive rank
15,01    to TRiBE material *WILL NOT* have any support from TRiBE.

15,01 00#  15For those of you just joining us, or those stupid enough to see anything
15,01    that Devil's Spawn says and think it has any relevance whatsoever, we
15,01    do not have Sites, HQ's, Couriers or other non-artists, nor do we want
15,01    any of those things.  The TRiBE Archive gets anywhere of any relevance
15,01    at an appropriate enough speed without all the red-tape, beuracracy for
15,01    the no-talent-layden of the scene to feel, useful - type of orginization.

15,01 00#  15Told you it would be short. . .
