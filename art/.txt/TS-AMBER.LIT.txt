15,01Days of prosper all but gone,
15,01The Aftermath trudges on,
15,01No more the days when hope still shone,
15,01Unending night; fleeting dawn.

15,01In the rubble we make our homes,
15,01Work our bodies to the bone,
15,01Happiness all but unknown,
15,01The hopes of salvation turned to stone.

15,01Each endless, futile day we number,
15,01Laying waste in a world grown somber,
15,01In futile soils and dreams we clamber,
15,01Since the whole world turned to Amber.

15,01                                  .Ts.
