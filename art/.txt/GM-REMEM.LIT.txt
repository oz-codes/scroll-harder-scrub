15,01                          The things I never told her,
15,01                          and the things we never did.
15,01                                   And that,
15,01                                  in the end,
15,01                              will be my undoing.
15,01                                 for eternity,
15,01                          I will suffer for my regret,
15,01                                  and my soul,
15,01                          will forever search for her.
15,01                           And where ever I find her,
15,01                                  in the end,
15,01                                    I hope,
15,01                             that once in a while;
15,01                               even along while,
