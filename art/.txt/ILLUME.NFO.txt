15,01            ?  This is mainly a small maintenence release (I've been10    
15,01               a little lazy with Illume the last month).  Not a lot
15,01               has been added or modified.  I HAD planed on putting
15,01               mouse support in, but right now I dont feel like doing
15,01               it, since its SOOOO tedious to do!!! IMO, ugh... ;>
15,01            +  Illuminate now sports a new interface, Designed by

15,01            +  Viewing Ansis in SVGA modes is now a LOT faster (about
15,01               2x to 3x faster).  The earlier code was slow due to a
15,01               stupid "oversite" on my part...

15,01         0  v1.6  -09.94-
15,01            *  A title screen was finally added.
15,01            *  Illuminate no longer depends on ANSI.SYS for Ansi-
15,01               Mations!  Illume uses direct memory writes to do
15,01               it, so that means its fast too! (sometimes too fastnate
15,01               ;> ).  So that means Illume now FULLY supports  purpose
15,01               AnsiMations in TEXT and MCGA modes!  this also means my
15,01               that illume no longer needs ANSI.SYS AT ALL!NPI or VOR,
15,01            -  You no longer have the option of turning the cursortime
15,01               ON and OFF. Now it just stays off all the time.ate  was
15,01            *  Now use the + - keys while viewing an ansi to changeped
15,01               the current resolution.  Note that, when you go from IS
15,01               a TEXT mode TO a Graphic mode, It will have to Create
15,01               a new palette, & when you go from a Graphic mode to a
15,01               TEXT mode, it will have to Re-Load the file again. It
15,01               does this because of the way the ansi gets loaded, it
15,01               tries to use the least amount of memory possible.
15,01            *  The 3 SVGA modes have been coded back into Illuminate.
15,01               (finally).  The code is my OWN (not that BGi crap!),
15,01               and they are very limited.  It only supports the VESA
15,01               standard, but that shouldnt be a problem anyways.
15,01               The setpix() routine is a little slow, but that will
15,01               be speeded up later... (ScrollBack is NOT supported
15,01               in the SVGA modes).nch.ICE routines)
15,01            *  Illuminate now incorporates SMOOTH scrolling when
15,01               viewing ANSi's In the VGA Graphics modes.00 it may be put
15,01            +  VGA mode 360x480 was replaced with 320x400.00ases another
15,01               This mode gives the same effect (almost) of a 50 line
15,01               Text mode.on support in TEXT and MCGA modes
15,01            +  The ANSI Pharsing routines have been improved.
15,01               It now supports file's  that have lines longer then 255
15,01               chars.~3800 file/directories in one sub-directory
15,01            +  The 400 line limit in scrollback mode has been  broken.
15,01               Its  now  only  limited to  the  amount of conventional
15,01               memory you have available.n.

15,01            *  When EXECUTING an EXE/COM from the picklist.  Illume
15,01               will now "shrink" it self in memory, to give as muchs)
15,01               memory as possible to the new executable.
15,01            !  Minor drawback.  The configuration is now saved in an
15,01               external CFG file.  For some reason the RIP routines
15,01               interfear with some of my other routines for figuring
15,01               the EXE size, so I can't attach the config there.
15,01                (Even though the RIP routines are not included in this
15,01                release, I dont feel like changing everything around
15,01                again, so that the CFG is saved in the EXE.
15,01                -Live with it!)
15,01            *  Added XGA mode 360x480x256 for viewing ANSI's. -works

15,01            *  Completely RE-Coded the Option's Menu.
15,01            +  Now 7 filemasks can be searched at once, instead of 3.
15,01               (this can be changed to as many as i want, but the
15,01               option menu, can only hold so many file masks in thedes

15,01            +  Greatly increased the scrollback speed for MCGA mode.ic
15,01            *  0-1 level RIP support has been implemented.  Rip routines
15,01               are by Cap'n Chrunch / ICE. (as if you could'nt tellThe
15,01               by the NAG when illuminate starts. ugh!).
