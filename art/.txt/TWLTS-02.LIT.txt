15,01.The Twisted Tower.

15,01He stands alone, on a great peak,
15,01Waiting for the one, he must seek.
15,01For without that one, he isn't whole
15,01Alone, he stands without his soul.

15,01The song which he loved ever so much,
15,01Was stolen from his beloved touch. 
15,01For without her, he cannot survive,
15,01Alone, waiting for the love he thrives.

15,01For when darkness fell, she was gone
15,01Still he waits; again it's dawn.
15,01He cannot stand it; she's not here,
15,01He screams into the night, with a tear.

15,01The clouds depart, and light bursts through,
15,01As she appears, her song takes que.
15,01Life flows into him; he's now so strong,
15,01They now, shine brightly, within their song.
