15,01                                    I.

15,01     The struggle was over, and he had lost.  Not for the first
15,01time, mind you, or even the second.  No, this was his third loss,
15,01and though his record remained impressive, it was an impossible
15,01loss to deal with.
15,01     "What happened," he thought, "How could I lose?  It was open
15,01and shut, an easy victory.  Well now they are stuck with Reyler. 
15,01It's not my damn problem anymore."
15,01     Unfortunately for the rest of the world, the man, or rather
15,01man-shaped creature, was correct in being depressed.  The trial
15,01he had just lost would place a terrible entity in an extremely
15,01powerful position.  The evil being he thought of, Reyler, was, in
15,01the literal sense of the word, a demon.  Well, he was no longer a
15,01demon, but now a god.
15,01     While the loser, Kirig, sat staring blankly upward, the
15,01newly reborn god laughed in his new heavenly home.  
15,01     "What fools they all are," Reyler said to himself, "Shows
15,01what overconfidence will do to any case.  They were amazed I even
15,01got the nomination."
15,01     Indeed the council was amazed, amazed any demon could even
15,01be considered for the position left open by the heroic self
15,01destruction of its previous holder.  Unfortunately for them
15,01Reyler had been able to call upon old, virtually unbreakable
15,01promises for favors in order to be given first nomination for the
15,01council position.  No one even imagined he would get past the
15,01trial phase, for his devious reputation was a well known one. 
15,01While well known, it was also well deserved. Well deserved enough
15,01to deceive even the infinite eyes of the high council despite the
15,01incredible amount of evidence brought against him by his old
15,01enemy Kirig.   He recalled how smoothly he spoke, how easily the
15,01lies found their way into the minds of those said to be
15,01omniscient.  Now it was over, for the moment he was judged fit
15,01for his position as god of the Earth realm he had changed the
15,01course of history for its inhabitants, who so arrogantly call
15,01themselves human.

15,01                                    II.

15,01     Of course the self-sacrifice of the earth's major god, their
15,01only high council member, went unknown to the small world's
15,01inhabitants.  They did not even hear word of the colossal battle
15,01by the high council to ensure the safety of the universe, or the
15,01dread of the trial to find the successor to their former savior. 
15,01No, the evidence reached these people in a far more subtle
15,01manner.  
15,01     It started with a few deaths.  First was the that of a very
15,01old Pope.  Then came a well known Jewish Rabbi.  Then an Islamic
15,01priest.  (Though the world's major religions refused to admit it,
15,01they are were simply sects of worship of the same, now fallen,
15,01divine entity.)  Soon faith in the god had broken down across the
15,01world.  Most people simply did not seem to see the odd string of
15,01deaths and resignations from religious positions as any sort of
15,01sign of the death of their religion.
15,01  Small cults appeared and disappeared faster then they ever had
15,01before in the world's history.  Only one cult seemed to last more
15,01then a few months, and this one was so small that they received a
15,01minuscule amount of media coverage if at all.  This cult
15,01worshipped a being who they called Reyler.   
15,01     At the head of the cult stood the Great Emmisary, a man who,
15,01before he decided that Reyler was his key to power, was called
15,01Gregory Tramme.  He was a spectacular figure to behold with his
15,01gray eyes, jet black hair, and nearly white skin.  He always
15,01spoke in a soft, but very convincing tone.  The Emmisary had
15,01found out about the Reyler cult just months before he took his
15,01current office.  He had seen the band of twenty or thirty
15,01wandering outside of a small Colorado town that he was making his
15,01home in.  Eventually he visited their camp and secretly watched
15,01as they held a religious ceremony.  
15,01     It wasn't the technicalities of the faith, or the being
15,01worshipped itself that fascinated Tramme, but rather the
15,01fanatical devotion that the people seemed to display for their so
15,01called god when that sort of zeal had been dead for what seemed
15,01like years.  Tramme had always longed for power, but his horrible
15,01social position as well as his isolation from any sort of power
15,01base made his dream seem impossible.  He realized that those who
15,01follow so fanatically would be the easiest to sway to him, if he
15,01was careful about how he went about his convincing.  
15,01     He joined the group as a mere follower at first, but then
