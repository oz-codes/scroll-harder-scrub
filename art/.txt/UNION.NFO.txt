15,01       Once again, Union produces another fine art pack.  Sitting back as
15,01    co-ordinator of things, I get to see each month how hard the members of
15,01    this group really work.  It is a pleasure to be a part of an art group
15,01    that seems more concerned over putting out art that is enjoyable than
15,01    seething with the usual power-hungry attitude.

15,01       Many things have happened over the last month.  The most prominant of
15,01    movements in the art scene was the merger of Empire with Union.  Various
15,01    talks with Empire were created and after a few calls between Shadowhawk
15,01    and Nailz, the deal was set.  Union would no move to be a very strong and
15,01    artistically bound team.  Union gained an overall total of approximatly 20
15,01    fresh, and very talented members.  One downfall from the merger was the
15,01    loss of Hooptie.  Due to matters out of his hands, he found himself needing
15,01    to drop out of the scene.  As well, Primordial Chowder found need to
15,01    remove himself from the scene for awhile, however, he did leave us with
15,01    some of his last works to add to our pack this month.  Replay thinks that
15,01    he will find a better home with Nation and has taken his artistic
15,01    endevours there.  He would have be a welcome addition to our group and
15,01    Union wishes him the best with Nation.

15,01       Elsewhere, Union kindly welcomes Dark Deception, formerly of Tribe
15,01    into our Ansi division.  Dark Deception is a very skilled Ansi artist as
15,01    Union is sure you will agree by the end of this pack.  Also, Exile, a
15,01    talented VGA artist from Toronto [905] joined on as a trial member with
15,01    Union and with continued effort, should have no problem becoming a full-
15,01    fledged member.

15,01       Future Assassin, one of our treasured music composers, was recently
15,01    stricken with a deadly case of Mono.  But, in his strong-willed nature,
15,01    he came back strong and wrote two new songs in one week.  Hound, yet
15,01    another member of our skilled Ansi department, found himself feeling
15,01    "under par" for Union standards, but we were quick to show him his
15,01    talents and brought him around.  Hound has determined that his thoughts
15,01    of retiring were silly and illogical so he has decided to stay, which we
15,01    are extremely grateful.

15,01       Unfortunately, Ravage Bias could not keep contact with us so he
15,01   joined iCE because he did not hear back from us.  We are still trying to
15,01   contact him, and encourage him to join if he is still interested.

15,01       Acidflash was at one point in a trial period, but due to an over-
15,01   zealous attempt at being in a group and not really giving serious effort
15,01   to his work, he was removed from trial status.

15,01       And last, but mst certainly not least, a very prominant collection of
15,01   coding's best, Apex, took on a project to make Union a new viewer.  This
15,01   was a most needed part of our packs ever since Winter Mute decided to
15,01   discontinue his.  Take note that due to much rushing on our part, Apex has
15,01   only been able to release a Beta version to their viewer.  There are still
15,01   a few bugs and options left open for future versions.  Even at the beta
15,01   state, it is a very well put together viewer and Union looks forward to
15,01   the final version.

15,01     I think that about sums up the works and business of Union over the last
15,01  month.  We hope you enjoy the pack, and if you like what you see, and/or are
15,01  interested in joining the group as a member or a supporting site, do not
15,01  hesititate to contact the group on a major Headquarter board.
