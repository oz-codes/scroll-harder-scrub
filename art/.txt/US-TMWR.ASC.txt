15,01        Here's a little something that should weird out pretty much everyone
15,01        who reads it.  It's a nice little log between me and messiah that
15,01        went wrong in a hurry.  Be warned, this is fairly sick shit...
15,01        At least that's what i'm supposed to say.

15,01<mESSIAH__> who is talisho?
15,01<whirrior> no clue
15,01<mESSIAH__> hmmmm
15,01<mESSIAH__> he's argentinian
15,01<mESSIAH__> so, therefore
15,01<mESSIAH__> he's lame
15,01<whirrior> hahahaha
15,01<whirrior> works for me.
15,01<whirrior> but now #schoolgirlsex has been cut off from me by the new bots.
15,01         dammit.
15,01<whirrior> notice that i'm obsessed for some reason.
15,01<mESSIAH__> damn
15,01<mESSIAH__> schoolgirlsex is rad
15,01<whirrior> damn right.
15,01<whirrior> but now it'll only be the bot in there for a while.
15,01<mESSIAH__> which bot is it?
15,01<whirrior> i have no clue.
15,01<mESSIAH__> nMANCEr is taking care of your +o
15,01<whirrior> but it still can't hurt to whine and complain like the little
15,01        bastard i am.
15,01<whirrior> oh wait, ignore that.
15,01<mESSIAH__> uhh
15,01<mESSIAH__> I wish I could mack on some 9th graders
15,01<whirrior> hahahaha
15,01<mESSIAH__> 'soo, you girls wanna play hide the salami?'
15,01<whirrior> how about you sterilize my science instrument.  wink wink.
15,01<mESSIAH__> hell yeah
15,01<mESSIAH__> 'oh that? Thats Johnson. He likes to be kissed'
15,01<whirrior> how would you like to babysit the twins this evening?
15,01<whirrior> now that one's obscure.
15,01<mESSIAH__> ahahahha
15,01<mESSIAH__> thats rad
15,01<mESSIAH__> talk about jailbait
15,01<whirrior> you know what scared the hell out of me?  i was researching a
15,01         paper for a class and ran across an article in an education journal
15,01          titled "sexual attraction between children and adults". it was a
15,01           damn odd paper.  i'll have to put it up on my page when i find it
15,01            again.
15,01<mESSIAH__> hmm, I bet you could pick up some pimping tips in there dude
15,01<mESSIAH__> btw, you have +o now
15,01<whirrior> it's damn odd.  about girls masturbating at an early age and
15,01         trying out their sexuality in a non-threatening situation or some
15,01          shit.  a few of us called the article 'icky on a stick'.
15,01<mESSIAH__> eww
15,01<mESSIAH__> well, my rule is
15,01<mESSIAH__> if there's grass on the field, lets PLAY BALL.
15,01<whirrior> yup, it's never too wet that you need to roll out the tarps.
15,01<mESSIAH__> hell yeah
15,01<whirrior> this would make one odd file for the pack.  i just thought of
15,01        that.
15,01<mESSIAH__> hmm, do it up
15,01<whirrior> it's all logged.  wink wink.
15,01<mESSIAH__> haahahh
15,01<whirrior> but this borders on my ideas of bad taste.  but like that's
15,01         ever stopped me.
15,01<mESSIAH__> dag, if its that close to bad taste, I'll probably like it.
15,01<whirrior> hahaha
15,01<mESSIAH__> hmm
15,01<mESSIAH__> was it written by a reputable source?
15,01<whirrior> and speaking of bad taste, i wonder how the lifesaver idea works
15,01         in a real-life situation.
15,01<whirrior> the article? oh hell yeah.
15,01<mESSIAH__> man
15,01<mESSIAH__> a disreputable source would probably be better. it would
15,01         probably know from first hand exp.


15,01 as an end note, i think we can all utter a group "ew" over this one.  The
15,01 important thing is that none of my kids never see this and get the wrong
15,01 impression. ;)
