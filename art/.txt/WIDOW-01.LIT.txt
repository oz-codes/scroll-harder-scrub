15,01       UNHOLY SALVATION
15,01       ----------------

15,01So it seems you have fallen dreams
15,01and your tears stand for nothing.
15,01In every waking hour, in all forms of power,
15,01lies fear and suffering.

15,01Ghostly images of past and present collide.
15,01A gloomy future you await,
15,01as bitter and dark as your fate.
15,01Throw in your towel and step aside.

15,01Decay with the best of them,
15,01for that's all the dignity you get.
15,01Your empty shell traps no scream nor yell,
15,01for your soul shall never forget.

15,01An eternity of sorrow is what's left of you.
15,01No bright light here.
15,01No white tunnel near.
15,01No signs of an afterlife you thought you knew.

15,01Life and Death make the perfect pair.
15,01It's quite disturbing and damn well unfair.
15,01The miracle of creation has left you to rot
15,01in this Unholy Salvation.
