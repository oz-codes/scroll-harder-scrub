15,01WWIV 4.23 Menuset by Ghent [Lapse]

15,01  I made these specifically for the "Especially for Gamers BBS."  These
15,01are set up for the WWIV BBS software.  Feel free to use the pictures from
15,01these menus for your BBS menus.  Keep the picutres in their fullness,
15,01and give credit to me somewhere, and that's all I ask.  If you have any
15,01questions, reach me at ghent@freenet.fsu.edu (internet), or call the
15,01EFG BBS at 801-298-5254.  Thanks.
