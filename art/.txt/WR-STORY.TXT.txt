15,01                The Story of a little boy named Whirr 
15,01                        (a parody in one part)
15,01                       ((quality in no parts ))


15,01        NOTE: this is a work of supposed humour.  anything you deem
15,01        to be of a serious nature is all in your own head.  So there.
15,01        Nyah.

15,01(IT BEGINNNNNSSSSSSSSS!!!!!)

15,01        What a wierd little whirr from the wrong side of town!
15,01        He turned a new leaf, and now never felt down.
15,01        And one fine sunny day, met the girl named "E"
15,01        whose wisdom and beauty shon for all to see.

15,01        Oh poor poor whirr! he soon fell in love
15,01        with someone who knew not what he thought of.
15,01        And "E" and her friends all had a good time
15,01        while whirr sat around and worried about rhyme.

15,01        What reason did whirr have for such insane behavior?
15,01        it now seemed that "E" was to be his heart's savior.
15,01        now whirr and "E" spent hours and hours talking,
15,01        but whirr got concerned it might be called 'stalking'.

15,01        What kind of hint, what kind of sign
15,01        could poor whirr hope for from this angel divine?
15,01        his mind kept filling with thoughts of her joy,
15,01        he kept hoping she'd end up with this doodleboy.

15,01        Whirr could conquer all troubles, endure all cost
15,01        but without "E"'s presence, his heart would be lost
15,01        in a world of apathy, a world of pain
15,01        with nothing to lose, and nothing to gain.

15,01        That is why "E" means so very much to me
15,01        and why this little babble she should probably never see.


15,01See?  now what is up there is a complete fabrication.  There are times
15,01when you just have to say 'fuck it' and play to people.  So that's what
15,01happened up there.

15,01        REALIZE THIS, fellow d00dleboys.  Spring Fever will soon strike
15,01(at least it had better) and many of you will find yourselves doing 
15,01exactly what was found in this poem.  SAVE YOURSELVES!!  Stay inside
15,01and play on your computer for the next few months.  Don't answer the 
15,01phone.  Don't look at anyone in school.  Don't talk to anyone.  Follow
15,01that advice and you should get through spring fever without a scratch.
15,01After all, that's what got you HERE, isn't it?


15,01(ooooh, is that sarcasm up there?  just might be.  Or maybe i'm an 
15,01idiot.  I'm willing to wager on any combination of the two.)
