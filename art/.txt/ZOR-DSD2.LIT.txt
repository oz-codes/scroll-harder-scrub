00,01Piercing sound, it's music to your ears,
00,01not a metal song, but a magazine appears.
00,01It's finally here, the mag of the future,
00,01bringing new heights, with tons of new features.
00,01An interface that's colorful, you see,
00,01it comes with literature written by me.

00,01Distorted Magazine is here to stay,
00,01don't question this, it'll bring dismay.
00,01The Duellist, The Zapper, and many more,
00,01have made this project possible, for you to enjoy.
00,01Art that waters your eyes, music that's pumping,
00,01you've never seen such quality, you know it's something.

00,01Month and month again,
00,01Distorted Mag will make Top Ten.

00,01to rate this simply amazing stuff?
