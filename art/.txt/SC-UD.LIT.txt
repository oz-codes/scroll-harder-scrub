15,01                           12To find yourself worried,
15,01                           10You're sweating and cold,
15,01                            00Your vision is blurry.
15,01                           02You sleep the next night,
15,01                           12But the dream re-appears,
15,01                              10You wake up again,
15,01                         00And try to grasp your fears.
15,01                          02You're tired, you're cold,
15,01                        12And can't get back to slumber,

15,01                            00You're very encumbered.
15,01                           02You'll never rest again,
15,01                              12Or so as it seems,
15,01                           10You just can't get over,
15,01                           00Your Unconquered Dreams.
