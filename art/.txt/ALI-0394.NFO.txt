15,01        Hullo!  This is Mass Delusion, senior staff of alive, writing
15,01this info file so you guys can get what's going down in alive here after
15,01our second release.  First, I'd like to extend congrats to our new members,
15,01who should give us solid performance and a better name!  Greetz shouted out
15,01to:

15,01Ragtop - S: Cardura, Art Dude, Cool Guy, From Kansas, and a pain in the ass
15,01        to recruit. <grin>
15,01Hellion - Co-S: ENiGMA, Got him through Ryunosuke's constant blabbermouthing
15,01        to us about everything. heh.. j/k Ryu!
15,01Demize - An old friend, whether he knows it or not, whose art REALLY
15,01        improved, and now we're glad to have him on the staff - thanks to
15,01        Thee 3rd for finding him.
15,01Mr. Sinister - S: The Necropolis. Not the TRiBE guy.  This one is outta 716
15,01        (Upstate NY) and does some REALLY hot looking VGA's.  Two of his
15,01        ALiVE Logos/pics are in the pack.  Welcome aboard - finally. :)
15,01Defluxio/The Beholder - Identity crisis kid, went by Defluxio on some rips,
15,01        and The Beholder on others, however, it's the same talented rip guy
15,01        that we picked up, and used well in our second pack.  Check out his
15,01        stuff.


15,01        For this pack, we only have a couple of major things to write about.
15,01First would be the old RIOT merger deal.  About one week after we released
15,01ALI-0194.ZIP, I wanted to apply for a RIOT site, so I called up Megatrons
15,01board and he asked to see the pack.  I u/led it, and within two days
15,01receieved a voice call from him.  He wanted alive to merge into RIOT.  Along
15,01with this deal came a senior staff spot for me, because at the time he
15,01thought I ran alive.  Well, we stalled, and finally decided not to do it
15,01because we are trying to make something out of our own label, and days
15,01later, RIOT collapsed.  *WHEW*  We're glad we waited that out and didn't run
15,01to merge.  Best of luck to megatron and the rest of the RIOT crew, wherever
15,01they call home now.

15,01        Still on the topics of mergers, we are negotiating a deal with
15,01UNiSoN (who since changed their name to CRiSiS because of UNiON confusion)
15,01and if we have any finalized results we'll throw a text file in the pack at
15,01the last second.  CRiSiS is a small, but strong group of laid-back artists
15,01who do a good job on their work.  We've been talking to them for awhile now,
15,01and since the name-change fiasco, Sludge has been more willing to talk<grin>.
15,01This is definitely a top priority for us, as merging with a talented group
15,01like crisis would strongly enhance our quality and up our output.  No hard
15,01feelings to the crisis crew for whatever comes of these talks.  Please note
15,01that these ARE talks, and ONLY talks, I just feel it better to TELL people
15,01what's going on instead of having rumors fly.  NOTHING is final yet.

15,01        I know I'm going to get a rep for writing long info files.

15,01        Also this month, a startling event happened to Variation
15,01(co-founder/senior staff).  We picked up a distribution site awhile back
15,01called 'The Eleventh Hour'.  RedmaN of ACiD co-ops the board, and when
15,01Variation did Grifter an ansi for the board, RedmaN talked to Rad Man of
15,01ACiD and they called up Variation and told him that he was welcome in ACiD.

15,01        holy shit.

15,01Let's start off by saying that after *ONE* release, we were hoping to be
15,01known, not having our founders invited to acid.  Well, back when alive
15,01started, VR and I had long talks about 'man, if *I* got invited to acid!'
15,01and what we'd do.  VR said he was die-hard ALiVE, and while he wanted to
15,01join(No matter what he says :) he decided to hold his position as ALiVE
15,01Senior Staff/Artist and to continue raising the excellence of his work and
15,01the quality of alive!  Thanks go to Variation - for the 'model member of the
15,01month' award.  He showed great loyalty, and it's been a morale booster here!
15,01To ACiD: Thanks!  Tryin' and stealin' one of our founder d00ds! <grin>

15,01        As a last side note, I want to comment about small groups and the
15,01ansi scene.  People constantly yak about how small groups should stop
15,01forming and how they never last and this and that.  I'll tell you one reason
15,01they don't last, if they have ANY talent, bigger groups view them as either
15,01a threat, or a treasure.  If it's the former, they try to merge, if it's the
15,01latter, they try to merge.  And if the group refuses, oftentimes bad
15,01feelings fly and we have an extradited group.  The 'politics' of the scene
