14,01Hey all, hope your spring is starting to look as sunny as15          j$'
14,01can be.  This is my third Spring over at FLiP Productions, and15     `Qb_ ,'`b
14,01I'm pleased with how everything has changed in the past few years.   15`"2+-+'
14,01And I'm especially surprised at how much has changed in the last month15. `+,  
14,01First of all, I'd like to welcome a new coder, 13Moose14[904].15  14Hopefully15      `+,
14,01we will see some of his future15 14projects very soon.15 14Also,15                 _,-+'
14,01I'd like to welcome back the15 14talented artists15             ;"2b,  _    ,P2"
13,01Arsenik14[604]15 14and 13C214[503]15 14(formerly Terrakomm, Solar15       `"+-++'"`q, Qp, 
14,01Seven, and Touchtone).15  14Arsenik has taken the much needed15      `Qb  Qb `"2+,
14,01position15 14of art coordinator. Speaking of coordinators, we are15    "'  `"+,_,+'
14,01still in a transitionary period between their involvement of putting
14,01together.  (...still looking for a coodinator for the courier department)
14,01So coordinators, be patient, and we will15 14soon get into gear on15 14how things
14,01will be done in the departments.  Of course if you have any15 14suggestions 
14,01on what should be done, feel free to e-mail me.

13,01Redcoat14[+65] (coder/reversified) is now working on the new FLiP publication  
14,01which is the15 14'04Reversified14' e-mag.15 14Currently, if you wish to help15 14out with
14,01the emag, be sure to e-mail him.

13,01Surge!14[313] is the FLiP Clan Team Captain and has officially registered
14,01the 04FLiP Clan14 with Clan Ring.  The FLiP Clan Webpage is also up but under
14,01construction.  It is in need of more grafx.  If you are interested in 
14,01trying out for the team or wish additional info for a scrimmage, please
14,01be sure to e-mail him.

14,01Special thanks to 13Faust14[904] (artist/communications coordinator)  for 
14,01implementing the FLiP members mailing list and the #flip channel on efnet. 
14,01Communication between the members has increased tremendously because of his 
14,01help and they've also added a greater sense of unity within the dedicated
14,01group members.  

14,01Of course, this added benefit didn't come without its consequences. This
14,01past month a couple of former (first time FLiP ever KICKED anyone out)15 14FLiP
14,01members (who shall remain nameless at this point) tried to draw FLiP into a
14,01little scuffle with another art group... testing the limits of FLiP's
14,01intolerance of becoming involved with the immature group politics that FLiP
14,01was created to avoid.  Needless to say, it is necessary to revisit the roots
14,01of FLiP Productions... In June 1994, FLiP was founded by Kid Terrific on the
14,01premise that... the main reason we created our multimedia artwork was for fun
14,01as well as spread our creativity to a larger audience.  At the time, many
14,01art groups were being burdened with "elite" and "I'm-better-than-you
14,01attitudes".  FLiP choose to avoid all of that and returned to the true roots
14,01of multimedia art.  Years later, the scene has changed tremendously, and
14,01though the remnants of older attitudes lingers on, the FLiP ethic remains
14,01the core of our group.

14,01Anyhow... a slow but action packed month.<g>   So we encourage all flip
14,01members to get hooked up with the flipmailing list and drop by the flip
14,01channel when you get a chance.15  14As always, flip is looking for new talent
14,01and ideas...  join the team today!

14,01That'll be it for this month.  Enjoy the pack.;}
