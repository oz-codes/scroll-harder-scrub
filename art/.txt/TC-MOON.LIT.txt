15,01Moon Play

15,01I look to the sky
15,01and see the moon flying solo.
15,01I think to myself, that could be me.
15,01A single voice rings loudly,
15,01louder still in my ear.
15,01What seems to be a million miles away,
15,01only a few bytes from me.
15,01Distance you see, along with other barriers
15,01has been destroyed, like long distance carriers,
15,01by the net in wich, we all seem trapped.
15,01In this void of endless transmissions
15,01and uncensored visions, i hear a voice.
15,01I look again, out my window to the sky
15,01and I see the moon flying solo.
15,01I think to myself, how many of us
15,01each night we trek, see the same light
15,01through our portals to the outside.
15,01I know of one atleast that shares the light.
15,01Our window to the world, a digigtal screen
15,01we've seen more places, all the world data
15,01a keystroke away, but still our desire
15,01is but a voice, a body to listen, a kindred giest
15,01So we move among the channels, eating our share
15,01of an ever shrinking bandwidth , leaving our mark.
15,01I long to hear you, your simple, sexy voice,
15,01be it digital, analouge, or just a dream.
15,01The moon play's its tricks, flickering quickly
15,01violently and passionately, and then fades.
15,01I wait again for tommorrow, or rather its end.
