15,01      57 ELM STREET      BETHLEHEM, PA.      11:51 P.M., DECEMBER 24TH


15,01      We're too late! It's already been here.

15,01      Mulder, I hope you know what you're doing.

15,01      Look, Scully, just like the other homes: Douglas fir, truncated,
15,01 mounted, transformed into a shrine; halls decked with boughs of holly;
15,01 stockings hung by the chimney, with care.

15,01      You really think someone's been here?

15,01      Someone, or something.

15,01      Mulder, over here, it's a fruitcake.

15,01      Don't touch it! Those things can be lethal.

15,01      It's O.K.  There's a note attached: "Gonna find out who's naughty
15,01 and nice."

15,01      It's judging them, Scully. It's making a list.

15,01      Who?  What are you talking about?

15,01      Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel
15,01 at great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once each year, near
15,01 the winter solstice, this creature is said to descend from the heavens to
15,01 reward its followers and punish disbelievers with jagged chunks of antracite.

15,01      But that's legend, Mulder, a story told by parents to frighten
15,01 children. Surely you don't believe it?

15,01      Something was here tonight, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this
15,01 gingerbread man.  Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive
15,01 and in a hurry.

15,01      It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder, this milk glass has
15,01 been completely drained.

15,01      It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.

15,01      But why would they leave it milk and cookies?

15,01      Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.

15,01      But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and
15,01 windows were locked. There's no sign of forced entry.

15,01      Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace.

15,01      Wait a minute, Mulder. If you're saying some huge creature landed on
15,01 the roof and came down this chimney, you're crazy. The flue is barely six
15,01 inches wide. Nothing could get down there.

15,01      But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions at
15,01 once?

15,01      You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?

15,01      Exactly. Scully, I've never told anyone this, but when I was a child
15,01 my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white shanks of fur
15,01 surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head. Its bloated torso was red and
15,01 white.  I'll never forget the horror. I turned away, and when I looked
15,01 back it had somehow taken on the facial features of my father.

15,01      Impossible.

15,01      I know what I saw. And that night it read my mind. It brought me a
15,01 Mr. Potato Head, Scully. It knew that I wanted a Mr. Potato Head!

15,01      I'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of
15,01 physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars
15,01 across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to
