15,01- firewater lake -



15,01I have a lake inside me.
15,01All hot
15,01and bothered
15,01a steaming froth
15,01a broth
15,01of such a muck
15,01that it's akin
15,01to firewater.

15,01A burning, raging hell
15,01Wet as Wednesday rain
15,01Yet hot as the Sunday thaw.

15,01A $1.49 drink of Naya and kerosene;
15,01Just one match and you've got a picture;
15,01A living, moving picture
15,01.
15,01of ME.

15,01the lake is there
15,01it's always brimming and brewing
15,01and stirring and stewing
15,01.
15,01it's called my EMOTIONS;
15,01ever-changing
15,01ever-ever
15,01whatever.

15,01fire and water
15,01ash and ice

15,01a convention of paradoxes
15,01and me; all me; always me
15,01caught dead in the middle

15,01but that's all you've got
15,01when your soul is alive
15,01and bubbling over
15,01with the curse
15,01of Firewater.



15,01- Scimitar Wraith - hmm - it must be getting late.  I'm starting to BaBBle!
