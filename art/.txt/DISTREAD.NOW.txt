15,01             NEW DISTRIBUTION SITE POLICY FOR 3/94 ONWARD

15,01        This is the start of a new era for distribution sites.
15,01From now on, ALiVE distribution sites have a few requirements.  We don't
15,01want affiliation mongers only after the ALiVE name, we want boards that
15,01are INTERESTED in our work looking to support us.  So, as of this pack, 3/94
15,01there are new rules instated for dist sites.

15,011) If you don't call and confirm your distribution site, we'll assume you
15,01don't read these files, and that you don't care - you're deleted.

15,012) We are moving towards all-art boards.  Your board needs to show a strong
15,01art emphasis to remain a site.

15,013) MRi is our official network(as well as being sanctioned by UNiON),
15,01we are REQUIRING ALL SITES/MEMBER BOARDS TO JOIN, if you can't for some
15,01reason, call up Packaged Rebellion at 916/246.7165 and leave the sysop, me,
15,01Mass Delusion mail why.  We'll work something out.

15,01        i. Picking up MRi does not mean much.  All we REQUIRE is that you
15,01        pick up our general sub, the alive discussion sub, and the network
15,01        test messages sub.  All other subs are discretionary by the sysop.

15,01        ii.  To obtain the latest MRi packet, look on the board you got this
15,01        from, as the alive pack 3/94 and the MRI#01.ZIP were distributed
15,01        together.

15,014) We encourage ALL boards to consider MRi as their general network of
15,01choice.  We carry a wide variety of subs with quality boards and a maximum
15,01limit to keep active boards only. (does not include member/dist sites)

15,015) To all current sites who may get dropped - we THANK YOU IMMENSELY for
15,01your support since the first pack.  We will not drop you empty handed,
15,01everyone who is a site and is getting dropped WILL get a VGA/RIP/ANSi by
15,01ALiVE for their board(kinda like a door prize).  Thanks..


15,01        Hurry up and call Packaged Rebellion- 916/246.7165 No NUP
15,01        and reserve your site.  Thanks a million -


15,01                        The ALiVE Senior Staff
