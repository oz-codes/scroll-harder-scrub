15,01Change - Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01My life is black,
15,01My life is white,
15,01My life is gray.

15,01A life full of non existant boundaries,
15,01a field of dreams to roam free amongst
15,01spring flowers in the middle of fall.
15,01I shall run amungst the fields of my choice.

15,01The world is full of dangers,
15,01it is a constantly changing place,
15,01I shall endevor to change with it.

15,01My life is mine,
15,01no one can take my life from me.
15,01One bullet can take my life from you.
15,01Change...
