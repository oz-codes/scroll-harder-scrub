15,01iCE: for starters, please tell us about yourself.  first name, age, 
15,01     occupation, hobbies

15,01Farmy: My name is Scott.  I'm a busy dancer.  I'm unemployed and I live
15,01       with my parents.  My hobbies include minimalism, and lying during
15,01       interviews
15,01 
15,01iCE: How did you come up with the nick name Farmy?

15,01Farmy: Well I lie and tell people now that its short for Franklin L. Army,
15,01       but I think I got it originally when creating a character for 
15,01       Tradewars 2002 in 1989
15,01 
15,01iCE: That was a long time ago.  How long have you been following the art
15,01     scene?

15,01Farmy: since early 1993, when I ran my first bulletin board
15,01 
15,01iCE: Would we have heard of it?

15,01Farmy: It was first called the Texas School Book Depository, and later on
15,01       The Pantheon, which was where I first got involved with ice in an
15,01       official capacity, as the pantheon was an iCE BBS
15,01 
15,01iCE: Did you ever draw ansi's for your BBS?

15,01Farmy: Yeah I did a couple, the only one I ever liked was for another guy's
15,01       board.  I have no talent for digital artwork sadly.
15,01 
15,01iCE: How long have you been a member of ice?

15,01Farmy: I joined iCE in 1996 or so, I think because of my White House
15,01       security job at the time.
15,01 
15,01iCE: What the hell do you do for the group anyway?

15,01Farmy: I run everything
15,01 
15,01iCE: Like God?

15,01Farmy: yes
15,01 
15,01iCE: Can you be a little more specific please?

15,01Farmy: I host and run the ice servers, and handle everything related to
15,01       that from account management, to the occasional subpoena we get. I
15,01       also deal with all the emergencies, like when Verizon in their
15,01       infinite wisdom so completely fucked our T1 in the ear that its not
15,01       going to work for 4 weeks.  And that's if they rush it.  You've got
15,01       to be some kind of extra special dumbass if you can screw up
15,01       something that bad, but hey, only the best for iCE huh?  In the end
15,01       I had to pack up all our servers and move them upstream to our ISP.
15,01       I can recall another time when one of our original servers got sent
15,01       to us from New Jersey, well someone took one of the ethernet cards
15,01       out and left it inside the box to rattle around needless to say,
15,01       when I finally got it, there were a great many "loose parts" 
15,01       scattered about inside the server.  You know, like the CPU, RAM,
15,01       misc. transistors, wires etc.  That box went right in the trash.
15,01       Another time we got a subpoena for our logs from a DA in Ohio.  They
15,01       sent it to Rick (force ten), who sent it to me.  The fun part was
15,01       that they wanted it printed out and sent to their office when I
15,01       informed them that it would be over 50,000 pages, would use 9 toner
15,01       cartridges, and weigh in excess of 450lbs they were kind enough to
