08,01                               living in venice

08,01                       but they have a mean game of tennis

08,01                         well you're right now wondering
08,01                       " since when do monks play sports "
08,01                          well these monks are special
08,01                          they live in a health resort
08,01 
08,01                                yes these monks
08,01                      are of the heaven's-exercise-gate clan
08,01                         which promotes physical fintess
08,01                            for woman, child and man

08,01                          they brush teeth every day
08,01                          then go on a 42.3 minute jog
08,01                          after eating some vegtables
08,01                      it's time for a rousing game of pog

08,01                                 then one day
08,01                         they started playing tennis
08,01                              on a court so big
08,01                      there was none bigger in venice

08,01                            well one day monk kyle 
08,01                             said to monk nolan
08,01                  " your mother was so pregnant with you
08,01       that during the process of pregnancy, her uterus became swolen "

08,01                          well monk nolan was pissed
08,01                         but his comebacks were futile
08,01                         so he asked god for a weapon
08,01                        that he could use to kill kyle

08,01                        he prayed and prayed and prayed
08,01                         and then went to be castrated
08,01                        he came back with a newdie mag
08,01                     and found out he couldn't masturbate it

08,01                         well he prayed and he prayed
08,01                    and god finally answered his request
08,01                           with a good dandy weapon
08,01                          a set, for the game chess

08,01                          well nolan practiced chess
08,01                          but he found out he sucked
08,01                           but he played monk kyle
08,01                    and didn't even wish him " good luck "

08,01                        well monk kyle kicked his ass
08,01                        and before nolan could speak
08,01                         kyle said " your mother is
08,01                             so old..she squeaks "

08,01                           monk nolan kept praying
08,01                        and god answered his prayers
08,01                       he sent down a workout machine
08,01                       and a special flight of stairs

08,01                         but nolan didn't need this
08,01                         so he returned it to sender
08,01                         god got pissed off at this
08,01              and sent him a lender's, (bagel that is..texas tea)

08,01                       well this didn't help him either
08,01                         so he prayed to god jehovah
08,01                       who gave him a waterpolo court
08,01                     and a doggie he nicknamed "rover"

08,01                       well monk kyle came up one day
08,01             and said " is that your mother or your dog rover?? "
08,01               monk nolan said " you think you're all that...
08,01                      but are you a good waterpoloer? "
