15,01                           --------------------------

15,01    0) Howdy!  The Untimed here.  This is my first pack so if you happen
15,01        upon a mistake or two, it must've been the way you unzipped it. :)

15,01    1) CyberCrime is back!  While Cavalier set up as the new CCi hub,
15,01        Net Distortion took over and held the fort.  Cavalier is slowly
15,01        getting CCi back under control, so the iCE subs will be picking up      
15,01        before. iCE sysops are encouraged to pick up the CyberCrime network.
15,01        More information is available from Cavalier on Network News 54.

15,01        Coming Soon . . .

15,01    2) This month we witnessed the departure of two valued iCE members, STiLE
15,01        and Quazar.  STiLE, formerly an iCE Director, has taken leave of the
15,01        entire scene and his board, Silicon Vortex, is no longer running.  He
15,01        was an excellent member and will be missed.  Quazar, formerly an iCE
15,01        Director and our resident ANSI LoGoD, has taken a leave of absence
15,01        from iCE to hone his ANSI skill.  We wish him luck and hope to see 
15,01        an improved Quazar in the future.

15,01   2a) Also, Lemming of iCE Euro has been asked to leave the group.  It seems
15,01        our Euro President, Genesis, believed Lemming to be signing his name 
15,01        to works generated by a GIF-to-ANSI converter. Hopefully this matter
15,01        matter will be resolved soon.

15,01    3) Lord Mischief is back and he's staff. :) Praise be.

15,01   3a) It's an honor and a privilege to welcome to the iCE crew, VindicatioN!
15,01        Formerly of the Valiant crew, VindicatioN is an accomplished ANSI and
15,01        VGA artist and we all look forward to working with him in the future.

15,01    4) Hi, this is Metal Head.  I just have a few semi-quick things to 
15,01        say.. Well, not all too quick but oh well...
15,01    
15,01    4a) First, I want to explain to you the changes that have occoured in 
15,01        our VGA section.  One of those changes is that, from this point on
15,01        all VGA artwork will be released in the sam way that ANSI Artwork
15,01        is... Uncoded.  Why you ask?  Well here are the reasons:

15,01          #1 - In my personal opinion, VGA artwork could use some 
15,01               improvment.  So, by having all of the VGA artwork released
15,01               uncoded, VGA will need to stand on thier own 2 feet.  And
15,01               hopefully more well-rounded pictures will be produced, 
15,01               (Meaning Foreground picture, background, etc) rather then
15,01               just "foreground" pictures. 
15,01          
15,01          #2 - Loaders (Meaning VGA pictures that fade in then out)
15,01               look bad and are not something which our coding talent
15,01               should be focused on.  Which is what happens in months 
15,01               like june (i.e. iCE-693.ZIP).  So this will also free 
15,01               up our coders to work on other projects.

15,01          #3 - It will make the iCEPACK's considerably smaller, meaning
15,01               no more 2.6 Meg Packs.

15,01          #4 - In the Advent of RIPTerm, uncoded VGA's would become 
15,01               "postable" while a coded VGA would not.

15,01        The other change is that all of our Coded work (Intros, Mini-Demos,
15,01        eventually Demos) will be released on thier own, separate of the
15,01        iCEPACK.  If you have any questions or complaint feel free to
15,01        InterNet E-Mail me at "metalhed@phantom.com".  Or mail me on
15,01        The Prototype, 301-294-9334.  Just send Matrix Feedback or feel
15,01        free to apply.

15,01   5) The iCEMAG _will_ evenually happen, at the moment our coder has been 
15,01      on vaction for what I think is 2 months.  He will be home to begin 
15,01      the school year, so the mag will begin being worked on again at
15,01      that point.
15,01   
15,01   6) I would like to apologize for the mistakes in the last pack.  They
