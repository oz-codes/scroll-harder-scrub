00,01Revolution Calling

00,01In the silent hours between twilight and dusk,
00,01Deep within the eyes of every night creature,
00,01There is an unspoken language of knowing...
00,01Establishment has lost it's purpose-

00,01Calling on a reed,
00,01We hear the voice of revolution at the apex
00,01  of every fear,
00,01And now it's time,
00,01The table's been set-

00,01In the heart there is a need,
00,01Change is coming...
00,01In the soul there is a yearning,
00,01A desire to shift in form
00,01And be free-

00,01All order wiped away,
00,01This is the evil land
00,01Baked dry in the sand,
00,01Dreams of conformity falling
00,01Hidden deep in mirth
00,01Revolution Calling-
