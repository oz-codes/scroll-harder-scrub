15,01  12Ane here are a few more poems I made up during the last couple of days...

14,01----#------------------------------------------------------------#--------------

15,01  12A few days ago I heard a cewl tune by Knuddel. It was called RAIN. Well, now
15,01  12I suddenly felt like making a poem for this song...

15,01                                  12Let it Rain

15,01                              12Let it rain,
15,01                              12A day a month a year.
15,01                              12Let it drain,
15,01                              12All life without a fear.

15,01                              12This is now.
15,01                              12A moment of extremity.
15,01                              12Now it will sow,
15,01                              12The seeds of mentality.

15,01                              12Life in the air,
15,01                              12From above in the skies.
15,01                              12Who will dare,
15,01                              12To stop the divine scythes.

15,01  12I read an interesting poem about the seven gods in the last eXpose art pack.
15,01  12Well, I suddenly had an idea for a poem...

15,01                              12Three Gods of Destiny

15,01                          12They sit there ahead of you,
15,01                          12...But you cannot feel them.
15,01                           12You know they control you,
15,01                          12...drive your every action.

15,01                    00The first god thought of as the greatest,
15,01                         00A god of fairness and justness.
15,01                            00He sees your good deeds,
15,01                             00Causes you to do right.

15,01                           14The second god the darkest,
15,01                          14He brings about your madness.
15,01                     14Searches your evil and on it he feeds,
15,01                 14Devouring your self-esteem and causes a fight.

15,01                           00The third god14 changes alot,
15,01                           00He's like a14 toss of a dime.
15,01                           00You may be good14 one minute,
15,01                           00But you may 14be bad another.

15,01                         12It is only a question of time,
15,01                          12Just follow anyone you like.
15,01                           12But as far as I have know,
15,01                           12I have chosen the third...

15,01                               12$ h i n i C /+ m i

15,01  12Look carefully at this poem... you will realise that the second, third and
15,01  12fourth stanzas are different from the first and fifth... how ? Well, the
15,01  12second stanza is in a form like this -> \/15 12<- it is like a puramid upsidedown
15,01  12so that the most words is on the top (like god is "on the top"...
15,01  12The third stanza is a pyramid placed correctly -> /\ -< and the most of the
15,01  12text is on the bottom (kinda like the devil is on the bottom)...
15,01  12And the fourth stanze is equal on all sides ! because this god is like a
15,01  12coin. You can through it, and you have equal chances of getting a head or a
15,01  12tail...
15,01  12Well, any "lit" people out there may be able to understand what I have been
15,01  12trying to convey in this poem... good luck ;)
