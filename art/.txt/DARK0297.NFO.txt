15,01      In February of '94, the 00first15 ever 00DARK15 Collection was released into the
15,01   art scene.  Considered a talented crew of up and coming artists, DARK was
15,01   seen as the source of new blood for groups like ACiD and iCE.  In some
15,01   respects, this was true.  But...

15,01      This is February, 1997, and we're going all Dracula on your ass.

15,01      00Welcome to the DARK New Year.

15,01      Joining DARK Illustrated this month are 00Blackmage15, a promising new 00VGA
15,01   artist, and 00Fractal15, a well-known 00ANSI15 artist with great skill and a fair
15,01   sense of adventure when it comes to trying different styles.

15,01      Also, we'd like to officially welcome 00Holocaust15 into our folds.  As most
15,01   locals have known for months, Holocaust has been itching to join DARK.  The
15,01   only thing preventing this was a disagreement among Seniors about ASCII
15,01   artists within the group.  Well, hO's won his war.  :>  And as you can see
15,01   by the memberlist, .NFO, FAQ, and logo colly, he's been keeping busy.

15,01      00Samurai15 has informed us that he'll be taking a leave of abscence for an
15,01   unknown length of time, in order to sort a few personal issues out.  All
15,01   of us hope him the best of luck and swiftest of resolutions.

15,01      This year, we'll finally be retiring the faithful ol' 00DARKViewer15.  It's
15,01   been a real pleasure, but 00Mist of Death15's work of (and for) art is in need
15,01   of an overhaul.  What will replace it, you ask?  Something we're proudly
15,01   naming 00Nightvision15.  Stock up on your carrots... ;>

15,01      DARK's "00Best of '9615" Re-Collection pack will be out this month, barring
15,01   any sort of malfunction within group motivation.

15,01      As you may've read a few months ago, "00Eclipse_Net15", DARK's official mail
15,01   network, shut down to be replaced (eventually) with 00Depth_Net15.

15,01      Xypher Matryx is pleased to announce that Depth is finally up and running
15,01   after a series of delays.  Though not an official DARK system, most members
15,01   can be reached through any of the network's nodes.  The information packet
15,01   has been included with this archive for anyone interested.

15,01      This web site will feature many DARK-related links, as well as support
15,01   for groups and functions the original BBS has to offer.
