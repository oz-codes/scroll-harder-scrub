15,01       14Here's a tribute, for all the people that can rightfully say,
14,01   "We are brothers, and sisters." For Mike, Danny, Perry and especially
15,01      14Green. I'll love and cherish you guys until the stars fall from
15,01               14the sky, and may our friendship have no end.


02,01N14ight watchers never sleep,

02,01C14ome another day-

02,01T14here is a certain glory in this night,

14,01  than the closest star,
02,01T14rue friendship is built upon things like this...
02,01H14ow we've struggled to escape every pound that's
14,01  added to our weights,
02,01A14nd how we've sighed in the sight of despair,
02,01I 14swear, if I had the power, I would make it all
14,01  better again,
02,01P14lease, Lord God, don't let me fail-

02,01I14f I could swallow every tear inside me,
02,01A14nd walk away...

02,01W14ould it be easier to see
02,01T14he utter demise and death of a useless
14,01  society

02,01O14ut the door...
02,01F14alling again on the floor-

02,01I 14will dream of a better place,
02,01A14nd if we all pray long and hard enough
