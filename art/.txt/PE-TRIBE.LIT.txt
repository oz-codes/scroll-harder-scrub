15,01Invitation to TRiBE:
15,01-------------------
15,01by Prime Evil

15,01      "Some say I have no conscience. How false they are, even to
15,01themselves. I am the only conscience which has ever existed. As wine
15,01retains the perfume of its cask, I retain the essence of my most ancient
15,01genesis, and that is the seed of conscience. That is what makes me holy.
15,01I am God because I am the only one who really knows his heredity!"

15,01      What is it like to be a TRiBELiNG? How does one get into TRiBE?
15,01Why does TRiBE exist? Either one or all of these uncertainties may have
15,01been thrown around in your mind at one time or another. A TRiBELiNGJis a
15,01distinctive individual, quite dissimilar from any other in the scene. We
15,01are elite.

15,01      Being in TRiBE means neither being a demagogue of the masses nor
15,01scorning the scene completely. We compete, not to strive for ranking (
15,01for it would be self-effacing to compare ourselves to the commonplace
15,01artist ), but to demonstrate to others our superior nature. TRiBE is
15,01neither a democracy nor a dictatorship, but a collective, sharing one
15,01common factor... artistic excellence in the face of mundane mediocrity.
15,01We are the aphex of eliteness. Nobility in the purest form. We are the
15,01genus of persons that never have to deprecate themselves by doing such
15,01mundane things as completing applications or nfo forms or any other type
15,01of questionnaire. We are the type of people who are always at the top of
15,01the teleconference invite list. We are the type of people who get into
15,01iCE or ACiD without asking, or are never denied operator status on irc
15,01channels. We are elite.

15,01      One does not ask how to become a TRiBELiNG. One hopes that
15,01someday that the elite will see fit to consider him or her more than a
15,01speck of paint on the panorama of the art scene. The path to TRiBELDOM is
15,01a unsympathetic struggle to ascend above the ranks of second rate artist,
15,01who must be crushed under the iron heel of ambition, like so many talent
15,01less maggots. One prerequisite to receiving a coveted invite from Shihear
15,01Kallizad, is to understand that TRiBE is above and beyond anything iCE or
15,01ACiD is. It is true there are some fragments of TRiBAL quality in these
15,01two groups, but one can not begin to enumerate the multitudinous
15,01differences between the enlightened rabble and the truly superior. We are
15,01elite.

15,01      Human nature is to classify and to designate labels. TRiBE is
15,01merely a system of dividing humans from animals. TRiBE is a device to
15,01separate the wheat from the chaff, cream and the whey, gifted from the
15,01mundane. TRiBE is the epitome of prominence. TRiBE is the definition of
15,01art. TRiBE is the higher state all things strive (almost invariably in
15,01vain) to achieve. We are the old. We are the new. We are the elite.

15,01      You have been solicited to associate yourself with a class of
15,01specialists and artists that have aspired above the petty scene and
15,01realized a dawning apogee of artistry. The opportunity to associate oneUs
15,01self with TRiBE, is an honour that only few of the elite receive. Even
15,01fewer, turn down a chance to join the aristocracy of TRiBELDOM. This is
15,01your occasion. Do you go onward and join TRiBE and become one of the
15,01select... or do you reprobate our approach and mire back into your
15,01primeval posture, to never again have the chance to ascend into the ranks
15,01of the truly elite? You have 24 hours to sever your erstwhile
15,01affiliations and allegiances with the lower class, untouchables, and join
15,01our exalted ranks of authorities from each discipline of creation in the
15,01scene.

15,01...We Are Elite...
