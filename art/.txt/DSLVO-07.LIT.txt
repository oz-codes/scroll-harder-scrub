15,01Straitjacket Silence

15,01As I lay boxed in
15,01I train my headlights into the mirror
15,01what horrible might my vision holds
15,01the boundaray between manical scrawlings
15,01the buffer between insanity and sweet dance.
15,01Sightless horrors left undone,
15,01I ride my bridge between the flames
15,01one cold, one brief and holy shining light
15,01encased in riddles, laughter, personality,
15,01toss in my few million friends,
15,01crashing the 235 waterfall, 
15,01cascading down into the lights
15,01and still i see silence
15,01burning ever bright.
