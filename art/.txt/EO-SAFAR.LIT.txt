15,01FATAL SAFARI

15,01The poacher shot twenty elephants,
15,01All in one long day.
15,01Now he's leaving with the tusks;
15,01He sees no reason to stay.

15,01But where is his hunting companion?
15,01The fearless Doberman?
15,01He smelt something an hour ago,
15,01And into the jungle he ran.

15,01It's getting late very fast.
15,01The poacher doesn't care.
15,01Does he have time to find his dog?
15,01Or rather, does he dare?

15,01He walks deep into the jungle,
15,01Not hearing a sound.
15,01Until he hears a weak bark,
15,01And whirls clear around.

15,01The limping dog collapses,
15,01Blood pouring from its head.
15,01The poacher shivers as he examines the wounds;
15,01The faithful dog is dead.

15,01Then he hears the growl
15,01Of the huge savage beast
15,01Gleaming eyes study him
15,01He will be its feast.

15,01His palms are hot and clammy
15,01Eyes dart from side to side.
15,01He's out in the open,
15,01With no place to hide.

15,01He tries to scream for help,
15,01But his throat is too dry.
15,01He tries to run as fast as he can,
15,01But frozen feet doom him to die.

15,01One bullet is all that stands
15,01Between the lion and he
15,01But how can he aim
15,01When he can hardly see?

15,01Trembling hands raise the gun
15,01A sweaty finger pulls the trigger
15,01A bullet whizzes into a tree
15,01The lion's eyes look bigger.

15,01He takes the oppurtunity 
15,01To run away to his truck
15,01But the lion follows
15,01Which is just the poacher's luck

15,01He can't escape now
15,01He collapses like a sack
15,01White fangs gleam victoriously
15,01Then everything goes black.

15,01His truck is found in the morning
15,01Rangers speak in rising tones
15,01For among the glistening ivory tusks
15,01Lies a pile of human bones.
