15,01                  Straight from the center for disease control:

12,01   15     Hey there, Motherfucker. We're back. and there isn't anything you can
15,01do about it. The fucked up children of the infected are releasing again. Now
15,01we're embracing our true roots. We're not limiting ourselves to just art. 
15,01We're still doing art, but we're also doing coding, music, bbs Mods, and mabey 
15,01even a little expiramentation with telco and security. It's what we've always
15,01done, but we were never public about it, because we were always just artists.
15,01we're a little more creative than that. For example, take a look at this serious
15,01koding ability:


15,01..ssSS$$SSss..ssSS$$SSss..ssSS$$SSss..ssSS$$SSss..ssSS$$SSss..ssSS$$SSss..

15,01REM potato 95. The latest in tuber operating systems.

15,01        Move over future crew, here comes infectious. Yeah, right. After
15,01Rage reads this, he'll probably want to kill me. But seriously, we've got some 
15,01things in the works. Included in this month's pack is an EARLIE beta for 
15,01IV, Infectious view. Please keep in mind its missing things like custome screens
15,01and support for alot of goodies, but we're releasing it anyways so we can wet
15,01your appetite for future releases. Speaking of future releases, another project
15,01in the works is something caled EOS, better known as Ereet operating system.
15,01It's going to give you boring old dos an attitude, especially those of you
15,01limited to the confines of a microsoft product. <Everyone here at the
15,01center for disease control uses Bovine Systems / 2 and Linux>. Its looking
15,01pretty cool, with alot of configurability involved as well, to allow the user to
15,01customise for his or her desire. And yet another thing we have is an infectious
15,01application generator. the koding is all set, we just have to get off our lazy
15,01asses and give it an interface. But I thought it was pretty spiffy anyways so
15,01I included it in this months release. Don't you just -love- beta releases?
15,01Kudos to Rage.

15,01        Oh, yes. Brainrot. Brainrot is our, ahem, brainchild. It is to be the
15,01largest Art board in the arecode, hands down. Hell, it already is, without 
15,01even being open to the public. It will be loaded with T-philes ranging from
15,01cDc & hoe to the more technical workings of Leigon of Doom and Phrack Magizine,
15,01and Artpacks dating back to the golden age of art with groups like integredy,
15,01shiver, union, to the very current Apathy, Fire, and iCe. Isn't it just spiffy?
15,01and there is a catch, which most of the people in the 603 are would hate to 
15,01hear. The users on this new Jerusalem of bulliten boards will not suck. Mr.
15,01I just got a modem and I'm ready to surf cyberspace will not be tollerated. 
15,01Nor will the 31331 \\.ar3Z d00d. And finally, the "I just watched Hackers and 
15,01now I'm the best hacker on the face of the earth cause I can rollerblade and
15,01type on a laptop at the same time". Sorry, lamers. Well, not really.

15,01        Oh, yeah.. I thouhgt I should say I had about .S3M's in the works, but
15,01I ran out of time, so they were never finished, The only one that was even  
15,01close to finished I forced into a finished form. I'm not exactly happy with it,
15,01But I felt I should get at least one thing out, as far as music goes. I also
15,01have an ansi in the works, which is also almost finished, but Due to time
