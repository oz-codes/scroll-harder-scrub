15,01                            14H15e 00continues franticly,
15,01               00for the darkness pursues him like an evil hunter.
15,01                     14F15a00celess, it threatens to swallow him,
15,01                        00envelop him like a great beast.
15,01                              14S15t00ill he persists.


15,01                          14H15e 00longs for a reprieve,
15,01               00some light to bathe him of this foul absence,
15,01                 00but no, it's unforgiveness is maddening.
15,01                          14H15e 00panics, then pauses...
15,01                         00"14F15o00r I am surely the fool,
15,01           00the only thing as definite and unwavering as darkness...
15,01                                  00is light!"


15,01                    00"14T15h00is awful night must end, will end,
15,01                     00and give way to the life-giving day."
15,01                   14F15e00ar creeps over him once again, however,
15,01      00like the swarm of lightning bugs that teases him with their flittering.
15,01                14W15h00at if the day does not come, the sun not rise?
15,01      14W15h00at if the only thing that awaits this twisted world is eternal night?
15,01        14S15t00ill he persists, but now his only thoughts are of impending doom.
