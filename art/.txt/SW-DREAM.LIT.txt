15,01         - Dreams -



15,01In this slumber, I do sleep,
15,01As my soul I do impart;
15,01Sowing only what I dare to reap -
15,01Seeds of love inside one heart.

15,01In my dream, two candles burn;
15,01Melted wax falls from the flame.
15,01Tallow flows into return,
15,01Making our lives one and the same.

15,01Side by side, we touch the night;
15,01Loving life and this affection.
15,01Skin to skin, we slip from sight
15,01And drown in our annointed perfection.

15,01This is love as it was created to be;
15,01Tender touch of the dawn's fire.
15,01You and I, alive and free
15,01As we succumb to the force of desire.

15,01Live the night in pure ecstacy
15,01As I silence all your inhibitions.
15,01Fall into the silence with me
15,01As I start teaching you a new religion.

15,01My doctrine is purely pleasure
15,01As we reach and we find,
15,01That it's impossible to measure
15,01The depth of our love in this lifetime.

15,01One more touch before we depart;
15,01One more reminder of what can be seen.
15,01One more beating of my heart
15,01As the dawn washes over my dreams.
