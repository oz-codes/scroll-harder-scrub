15,01 Many years past, a great evil and injustice had been done.
15,01 People were being kept as property, as slaves.
15,01 It was not the blacks, who were enslaved by Americans in the 1800's.
15,01 It was the Jews; kept in Egypt to live and die working.
15,01 In time, the great prophet Moses was born.
15,01 He was sent down the Nile as a baby, for the Hebrew males were now being
15,01killed.
15,01 Found by the daughter of Pharoah, he grew up as a prince, seperated from
15,01his brothers, who toiled in the land as slaves.
15,01 One day he saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, and in a rage killed him.
15,01 He was forced to run away, because Pharoah had a price on his head now.
15,01 Working as a shepherd in the fields one day, he saw a most amazing sight.
15,01 A bush burning, yet it was not being consumed.
15,01 G-d called out to him, and told him to tell Pharoah to let the Jews go, or
15,01else he would bring down his wrath upon Egypt.
15,01 Pharoah refused, his heart was hardened.
15,01 G-d brought upon him and the rest of Egypt the first plague, the plague
15,01of blood.
15,01 Every water source the Egyptians had was turned into blood; the Nile 
15,01included.
15,01 Yet Pharoah would still not let the Jews go.
15,01 The second plague was brought upon Egypt now- frogs.
15,01 They were all over the place, surrounding the Egyptians in and out of their
15,01homes.
15,01 Pharoah was still not convinced that these were divine signs, and would not
15,01let the Jews go.
15,01 Next, as the 3rd plague, gnats infested the land of Egypt.
15,01 They swarmed, everywhere the Egyptians went they were covered in them.
15,01 Pharoah's heart was hardened still, and he would not let the Jews go.
15,01 In the fourth plague, the plague of beetles, the magicians of Egypt realized
15,01that there was divine inspiration here.
15,01 Pharoah would not, however, recognize a power greater then him.
15,01 The cattle were all killed next, plaguing something which the Egyptians
15,01worshipped and revered.
15,01 The people of Egypt were getting unruly. Yet still Pharoah was stubborn.
15,01 The 6th plague, the plague of boils, was the worst one yet.
15,01 Covered in them, the Egyptians were itching throughout their bodies.
15,01 Yet through all these plagues, the Jews had not been affected, for G-d made
15,01a seperation in the land.
15,01 The seventh plague was then upon Egypt, the plague of hail.
15,01 Everything outside was either destroyed or killed. But people and things
15,01inside remained safe.
15,01 Many Egyptians were now angry with Pharoah, demanding that he let the Jews
15,01go.
15,01 Pharoah would not comply with their requests.
15,01 The 8th plague, the locusts, brought filth and pestilence to the land of
15,01Egypt.
15,01 All of the crops of the Egyptians died; but the Jews crops were not affected
15,01in the slightest.
15,01 Despite all this, Pharoah's heart was hardened still, and he would not let
15,01the Jews go.
15,01 The ninth plague was the plague of darkness, and it would be horrible.
15,01 It was darker then the darkness of night.
15,01 So dark that the Egyptians did not move, for fear of hitting something.
15,01 The Jews had light, and plenty of it: they were safe from the plagues which
15,01ravaged Egypt.
15,01 Pharoah would not yet stand down, even after everything that he had 
15,01witnessed.
15,01 G-d would now bring the worst plague yet.
15,01 The slaying of the first born.
15,01 In every household in Egypt, a first born died.
15,01 Screams were heard echoing throughout Egypt on a non-stop basis.
15,01 The Jews were passed over by G-d, for following His commandments.
15,01 Pharoah finally agreed to let the Jews go, after all 10 of the plagues had
15,01destroyed his country and his family.
15,01 For his first born was no exception.
