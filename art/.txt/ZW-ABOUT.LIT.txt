15,01I was born in a cold dark excuse for a living body;
15,01I was raised somewhere past the Witching Hour;
15,01I was housed in a canvas sack of flesh,
15,01and made to know the claw marks on my back.

15,01It was the seventh day when I knew my mother;
15,01saw her talons, breaking chalk across my skin,
15,01white like everything forbidden;
15,01it was a time for tears and forgetting what little I knew.

15,01It was a cold December in my first year,
15,01I woke to find a crow upon my windowsill;
15,01I woke to find the bathtub filling with blood,
15,01and the mirror told me I had become what my mother left behind.

15,01It is raining in Novemeber; it is always November,
15,01it is never spring; I live a life forgotten,
15,01a life without birth, without knowing warmth,
15,01dragging my heels across bloody pavement.

15,01I am lying constantly in graveyards,
15,01and I can never read the names, I can never read the names,
15,01they're too much life, too much light:
15,01I taught myself to read with milk cartons.

15,01I am forever missing my own heartbeat,
15,01I never had one I am never sure what it is
15,01that is gone; I never had a heart,
15,01I am not ever sure what it is to love.

15,01This is the way my life escapes my eyes;
15,01trailing away like so much smoke and so much fire;
15,01like falcons shrieking up through the night,
15,01like the claws on my back, as I crawled into my eternal night.
