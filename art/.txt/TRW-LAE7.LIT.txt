15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        The sedative that Elminster was shot up with lasted for a full eleven
15,01hours. He awoke at around noon on April 16th, the day after he was captured,
15,01to find himself shirtless and secured by steel circlets around his hands and
15,01feet to what looked like a large metal operating table slanted at 20* short
15,01of standing upright on one edge. The corner of the room in which he was held
15,01had various kinds of diagnostic equipment set into the floor and ceiling
15,01leaving the walls completely bare. The section of wall-space opposite him,
15,01next to the door, was dominated by one huge computer screen with three
15,01smaller screens beneath it and a wide console of dials, switches and
15,01keyboards beneath them with three empty chairs sitting before the whole
15,01thing.
15,01        Discounting confusion and bewilderment, he didn't feel as out of it as
15,01he did the night before in the transport skiff. His body was numb but
15,01feeling was slowly returning to his limbs. Also, his right shoulder was no
15,01longer dislocated, just very sore. He shifted himself a little to the left
15,01to take pressure off it but found his efforts to be in vain, so he decided
15,01to leave it alone and wait for whatever that was going to happen to happen.
15,01        He was on the verge of falling asleep when finally someone came in,
15,01closing the door behind him.
15,01        The man was intellectual looking and dressed smartly in black pants and
15,01a white shirt accompanied by an unbuttoned white labcoat. In his right hand
15,01was a blue clipboard. He walked briskly by, taking a seat at the computer
15,01from where he eyed Elminster like a boy who was watching the giant panda
15,01exhibit at the zoo.
15,01        Elminster blinked. This was not what he expected.
15,01        "You're awake," the man said. "Good. My assisstant, the young lady that
15,01cleaned you up, was afraid that they had given you too much tranquilizer."
15,01        Elminster didn't expect conversation either. "Uh..." he started not
15,01really knowing what to say. "I've felt better."
15,01        The man laughed and pushed his black, wire-rimmed glasses further up
15,01his nose. "I should hope so!" he said. "I'm sorry we cannot shake hands like
15,01civilized men but at the very least, introductions can be made. My name is
15,01Joshua Tungsten but everyone here in the Bio Unit calls me Dr. Tongue."
15,01        "Cute," Elminster said and smirked.
15,01        Dr. Tongue smiled and just barely managed to touch the bottom of his
15,01nose with the tip of his tongue. "The ladies love me," he said.
15,01        Elminster couldn't help but laugh. "Well met, Dr. Tongue!" he said,
15,01feeling strangely British all of a sudden. "Stephen Elminster at your 
15,01mercy."
15,01        Dr. Tongue grinned and turned his clipboard around revealing a sheet of
15,01white paper with Elminster's name written at the top and many illegible
15,01scribbles underneath it. "I know," he said. "I've been expecting you."

15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        By the time that Dennis led Forbidden Image and the NEB unit into
15,01Elminster's lighthouse home on the lakeshore, Golgotha was already seated at
15,01the oval table in the dining area playing his third game of Solitaire and
15,01drinking his fifth can of beer.
15,01        "Sorry I'm late," Dennis said, taking a seat. "I couldn't find Kevin.
15,01Apparently he's gone off on an expedition somewhere with some other guys."
15,01        Golgotha set his cards off to the side and choked down another mouthful
15,01of beer. "Damn," he said. "Eternal Darkness's powers would have been very
15,01helpful on this mission. But at least you got the Retarded Warrior. He'll be
15,01a great help."
15,01        Forbidden Image locked the front door behind him and took a seat at the
15,01table. Calling back over his shoulder he said "Hey NEB! Don't just stand
15,01there, take a seat and sow the seeds of war with us."
15,01        The NEB unit was a synthetic human with enough weapons and tactics
15,01information stored in the memory core inside his head to fill two or three
15,01sets of encyclopedias. Unfortunately, that didn't leave much empty space for
15,01artificial intelligence, so he was left with the mental capacity of a
15,01seven-year-old only he followed orders to the letter. People who knew him
15,01sometimes called him the Retarded Warrior.
15,01        Presently, he simply said "Yes," and sat down next to Dennis.
15,01        Golgotha produced a small stack of paper, a packet of six different
15,01coloured pens, a RoloRuler and two folders, one red, the other black and
15,01said "The black folder is the most recent in-and-out schedule for the RDC
15,01supplied by Dennis's contact, the head of maintenance unit 6. In the red one
15,01is the only set of blueprints of the complex that I could find. They're
15,01about five years old but the place hasn't changed that much recently.
15,01        Dennis took a blue pen and wrote 'Shopping List' at the top. "Okay, any
15,01ideas spill them now. We'll build an arsenal as we go along."
15,01        The NEB's eyes scanned the faces of the people at the table as he
