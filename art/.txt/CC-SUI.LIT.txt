14,01Depression and despair abound in this place
14,01You only wish that you could show your face
14,01The neverending fear of self-loathing
14,01Has finally turned against you aburptly, brooding

14,01The feeling in your heart has disappeared
14,01It is as you had always feared
14,01No longer do you care who is your friend
14,01You simply wish that it would end

14,01At night you cry and wonder why
14,01At times like this you want to fly
14,01Your heart begins to tear at the seams
14,01Gone are all your existing dreams

14,01The darkness begins fold upon your soul
14,01You realize He has attained His goal
14,01This being who has made you fall so fast
14,01Has finally brought you peace at last
