15,01                               ~~~~~~~~~~

15,01Panting scraping,
15,01Screaming aching,
15,01Blood flows cool and thick beneath my skin,
15,01The muffled screams: They come again.

15,01The sheets suffocate and hold me tight,
15,01Pray for Mourning, pray for light,
15,01Darkness congeals, soaks my skin,
15,01Saps my strength, pray I do not fight.

15,01Darkness: lord of this domain,
15,01Cradles my fears, strokes the pain,
15,01Perpetuity in shortened breaths,
15,01The strain of Recompense weighs on my breasts.

15,01Each fear I handle like a gem,
15,01The God of Pain assembles them,
15,01Into a frail and shattered bowl,
15,01In which he pours one shattered soul.

15,01Night brings ghosts I cannot see,
15,01I hold in chains you cannot see,
15,01This soul that churns and burns to be free,
15,01The pain that I hold close to me.

15,01Screaming aching,
15,01Painful mistaking,
15,01Pain for Love and Love for Pain,
15,01I pray I shall not wake again.
