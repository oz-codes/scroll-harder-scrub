00,01     Tramme couldn't understand what he was doing wrong.  He
00,01stared at the page his writing appeared on and just sighed.  The
00,01Emissary had lived in his room for weeks writing the stories of
00,01Reyler in order to solidify the support of his followers.  He was
00,01engrossed in the project, engrossed to the point of seeing
00,01visions of the demon he claimed to serve.  All he knew now was
00,01that while he had just completed the part about Reyler's ascent
00,01to godhood, he could not finish.
00,01     It was as simple as this, Reyler's story did not end.  There
00,01was nothing to say after it.  He could attempt to predict the
00,01future of Reyler's existence, but that didn't seem to flow with
00,01the factual nature of the rest of his writing.  He came to a
00,01conclusion and quickly scribbled a few lines on the next page of
00,01his book.
00,01     The next morning Tramme finally tasted outside air.  He
00,01walked outside the compound and raised the text above his head.
00,01     "This is the Book of Reyler," he shouted. "This is the work
00,01of the our Great Lord as told by the second Emissary.  All those
00,01of Reyler's faith shall look upon this as the ultimate
00,01achievement, the greatest story of the greatest being ever in
00,01existence.  All who defy this work will meet with us, and we will
00,01make them believe it."
00,01     The startled crowed of Reylerians cheered.  They had not
00,01seen their mysterious prophet in weeks, and he had now given them
00,01a gift to affirm their fate.  Reyler would now forever live, in
00,01more then just their minds, but in the unassailable word of the
00,01written document.  Anyone able to be present at this moment would
00,01have been able to recognize it as a remarkable instant.  A group
00,01of devout worshipers looking for the first time upon the document
00,01that told them that they were right, and had the obligation to
00,01punish all those who were wrong.  
00,01     Day by day Tramme read form the book.  The sermons did not
00,01teach lessons, merely telling of how their great one began his
00,01rise of power from the rank of a lowly demon to a mighty god.  It
00,01eventually came time when the story of Reyler's ascent was
00,01finished.  Tramme was to read the next in the great history.
00,01     Instead of doing what was expected Tramme merely opened to
00,01the final page of his heavy volume.  He began to read, "Reyler
00,01lives, and always will from now forth.  We are honored to be his
00,01servants, and shall carry out his whims.  There are no lessons
00,01that Reyler teaches us thorgh stories, for we are the first, the
00,01lesson makers.  Strive to serve him and you will be the one
00,01recorded as a success in the later volumes; do not and you will
00,01be known as the one to perish under his whim.  For all future
00,01generations will read about you and know you as the people who
00,01took the earth for the true god."
00,01     Applause broke out even among the fear of the emaciated
00,01prophet's words.  They loved the Emissary, and Tramme knew it.

00,01     D'mer sat watching his old friend's latest schemes.  He
00,01laughed, but that wasn't unusual as D'mer laughs at most
00,01everything mortals did.  No there was not much odd at all about
00,01D'mer's presence, with one ever so important exception.
00,01     D'mer was a demon who loved to bask in the heat of mindless
00,01hysteria.  Nothing excited him more then seeing mortals kill
00,01mortals for no good reason.  Me was the champion of madmen, the
00,01divine to the psychotic.  He loved to watch fools wage was, and
00,01then feast on the souls of those who murdered in the heat of
00,01battle.  
00,01     D'mer had a particular liking for the North America on the
00,01world known as Earth.  He was often quoted as saying, "Where else
00,01do you get to see witch burning hysteria and ridiculously waged
00,01wars in less then a three century period?"  This made it even
00,01less unlikely that D'mer would choose to sit around watching a
00,01Colorado cult.  The only thing that seemed to not fit was that he
00,01wasn't alone.  
00,01     D'mer always loved viewing carnage on his own.  He had some
00,01loose acquaintances among demons, but only Reyler could even be
00,01given the title of moderate companion.  D'mer had been suddenly
00,01thrown however in league with another demon, Wilar, when Reyler
00,01took control of Earth's council seat.  Wilar was an old follower
00,01of Reyler, devoted to the evil cunning that Reyler thrived upon
00,01as opposed to the violent irrationality loved by D'mer.  Needless
00,01to say the two of them were not getting along very well.
00,01     "D'mer," said Wilar, "you must stop with that hideous
