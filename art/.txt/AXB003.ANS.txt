15,01dreams and 
15,01reality blend together,
15,01my mind melts into my pillow,
15,01my eyes flutter.

15,01my day consists of recollections,
15,01remembering what i did,
15,01when my eyes were closed,
15,01firmly, deviously living my
15,01other life, they can do nothing.

15,01sleeping more than i am awake,
15,01thinking of my dreams when i am concious,
15,01do i really give a fuck about 
15,01reality?
