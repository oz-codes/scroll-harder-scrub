15,01where the whale sings so sweetly.
15,01over the mountains,
15,01where the giant walks softly.
15,01        i know a place,
15,01        a place not to far away.
15,01        i know a place,
15,01        that's deep inside.

15,01under the ocean,
15,01where the fish move so slowly.
15,01deep in the jungle,
15,01where the hunter stares coldly.
15,01        i know a place,

15,01where the people walk silently.
15,01into the home,
15,01where people act violently.
15,01        i know a place,
15,01        a place not to far away.
15,01        i know a place,
