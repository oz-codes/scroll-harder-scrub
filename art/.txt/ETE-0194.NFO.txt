15,01           00Howdy everyone and a Happy (Late) New Year! And with the new
00,01    ETERNiTY continues to thrive and bring you great ANSi art to look at
00,01    each month. 93 was a good year for ETERNiTY. We broke into the scene
00,01    as a group with potential. Now, it is January and we have by far
00,01    proven oursleves to be an awesome group. When you look at this pack
00,01    make sure you notice how much we've improved from month to month. And
00,01    also realize that ETERNiTY was started from scratch. No ex ACiD/iCE
00,01    guys to get us going. We did this all on our own and are damn proud of
00,01    it. Things can only get better. Now, with having a group there are a
00,01    few things that come with the territory. People come and go, it's
00,01    almost and everyday happening in the scene today. Well, this month we
00,01    say goodbye to Kinayda who has left to join Gothic. We wish him the
00,01    best of luck and hope he has as much fun with them as we do with here.
00,01    But, on the same note we welcome three new talents to our humble little
00,01    organiztion. Cybernary, former president of iMAGE, has came on over to
00,01    ETERNiTY to join the fun. Deeply Disturbed, formerly of GRiP/AD has
00,01    also joined the crew. And finally, HANNiN, a newcomer to the scene has
00,01    decided to develop his skills with us. A great big howdy do da goes out
00,01    to them all.

15,01           00So, what else has been going on? Well, the official ETERNiTY
00,01    network has been moved to FanaticNet. FanaticNet is an ANSi Only
00,01    invite network. If you are interested in picking it up, call the WHQ
00,01    Death Row at [413] 782-1851 NUP: Nokdaglok. Just leave mail to the
00,01    SysOp Flat Line and he'll get back to you with some information. Also
00,01    ETERNiTY is looking for someone to help set up 1-800 Teleconferences.
00,01    If you are interested and you think you can handle it, please leave
00,01    mail to any Senior Staff member and we will get back to you ASAP.

15,01           00Now this goes out to all of you that wanted to write Lit for
00,01    ETERNiTY. We still do not have a lit dept, but Reality is an all Lit
00,01    ETERNiTY affiliated group. So, if you are interested in Reality, you
00,01    can contact Hot Rod or call the WHQ Death Row at the same number above.
00,01    Their first pack will be coming out on the 15th of next month, so look
00,01    for it. Ok, I think I have ran my mouth enough, enjoy the pack.
