15,01                        THEY  CAME  TO  CONQUER  TV
15,01          
15,01        Thousands of them huddled together in the underground chamber. On the
15,01planet surface, an awful war was raging. They had to escape, but where could
15,01they go? One stepped forward and began to display several charts. Then it
15,01spoke, telling the others of this new planet, Earth. On Earth, the natives were
15,01intellectually inferior, having not yet travelled beyond the confines of their
15,01own solar system.

15,01        There had not been enough time to find out everything about the planet
15,01and its people, and the aliens had fixated themselves on one topic: television.
15,01Television, the speaker explained, was an advanced computer that all earthlings
15,01obeyed. In fact, they had been conditioned by this machine, and now they
15,01willingly reported to it for hours at a time, proving how much power it held
15,01over them.

15,01        Five aliens would take on the dangerous mission: to take over or
15,01destroy television! As soon as they had control of television, they would make
15,01it order the people to worship them. If they couldn't control TV, they would
15,01have to destroy it. This would leave the earthlings with no leader, and as a
15,01result they would be helpless and easy to conquer. As soon as the population
15,01was either enslaved or terminated, they could take refuge there.

15,01        The chosen five stood straight and tall. They knew that the lives of
15,01the others depended on the sucess of their mission. The jet black spaceship's
15,01white lights flashed as its crew of five silently boarded. There were no cheers
15,01of support from the weak refugees as the ship soared through an underground
15,01tunnel and into space, blending in with the stars.          

15,01        It took many days to reach Earth. The long voyage was uncomfortable and
15,01dangerous, with meteorites barely missing the vessel. Finally it hovered above
15,01the planet surface and emitted a single white beam of light to the ground. They
15,01came down in the beam one by one, until all five stood in the wet grass. Set on
15,01a return course, the disguised ship eased its way back into the vastness of
15,01space. 

15,01        It was late and they were tired, but there was no time for rest.
15,01Finding the gravity too strong, they took a moment to adjust their gravity
15,01belts. The grass was higher than expected, and even with their Zappers, it was
15,01hard to move quickly. Suddenly, a screeching creature dove at them from the
15,01sky! They sprawled to the ground, safe. But wait! The creature had been
15,01sucessful in its attack. Nervously, the remaining four set their Zappers to
15,01" 7 " and continued.          

15,01        They shuddered at the cold, realizing that their light white clothing
15,01was too thin. Each pressed a purple button on its suit, turning it to fur.
15,01Warm and content, they decided that it was too dangerous to travel with
15,01screeching creatures ready to dive at them. They would wait a few hours until
15,01the things finished hunting. They found a tree to shelter them as they slept,
15,01and kept one of them on guard as the other three slept.

15,01        Their dreams were all horribly similar, nightmares of the terrible war
15,01in progress on D'lorgon. They thought of the merciless foot soldiers, the sleek
15,01airfighters, and the ruthless commanders. They thought of their terrified
15,01families, running to escape......

15,01        Each woke up sweating and terrified, determined not to fall asleep
15,01again. They journeyed on, ready to find out where television's central command
15,01was. Then they, and all who followed, could live on Earth peacefully, with no
15,01trouble from the barbarians.

15,01        Finally, they came to a black strip of land on which no grass grew.
15,01They decided to follow it, since it was easier than grass to travel on. 169
15,01grzapas later [one Earth hour] a loud roar penetrated the otherwise peaceful
15,01land. Realizing that it came from behind, they whirled around, and found
15,01themselves face to face with a hideous creature! It had metal fur and circular
15,01legs, and it was growling right at them.

15,01        Quickly, they drew their Zappers and fired, but the creature was
15,01unaffected. There was no time to set their Zappers up to "12". Three of the
15,01four leapt to the safety of the grass and began adjusting their weapons. The
15,01other (who was quite brave but sometimes too brave) stayed to face the monster,
15,01desparately firing again.

15,01        The red animal plowed right through, not even stopping to see what it
15,01had killed. The three furious aliens, Zappers at "12", avenged their dead
15,01companion by shooting at the creature's circular back legs. There was a noisy
15,01'pop' and the injured animal leaned heavily to the left. It slowed, and the
15,01three rejoiced, confident it was dead. After all, "12" was the highest setting.
