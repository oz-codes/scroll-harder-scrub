15,01we remain in the midst, of a rule not spoken
15,01what's that rule's meaning, but that it's to be broken
15,01world peace, coexistance, unravels such fiction
15,01while people roam wild, from some drug addiction
15,01through the minds smokescreen, we must perceive
15,01yet persisting, firmly, in what we believe
15,01the secret of life, is to stay alive
15,01with a strong will, ambition, and drive
15,01in a world of animals, we were the prey
15,01as ignorant then, as we are today
15,01beware my friend, you cannot deny
15,01that our life remains a self-centered lie
15,01we take in less, than the grief that we make
15,01the debt that we owe shall never forsake
15,01the past will come back, to haunt us in time
15,01what then was a law, will now be a crime...
15,01the lord giveth, and he shall taketh away
15,01and the wrath of our sins, shall make us repay.
