00,01Haiku

00,01Brave brown leaves hang on
15,01         00Through windy winter to be
00,01Shoved off by spring buds.

00,01The sun burns the land
15,01         00Relentlessly; carelessly
00,01A trout seems to smile

00,01I watch the sun set
15,01         00As I reflect on the past
00,01And journey onward

00,01Great, ragged, gaping
15,01         00holes hacked in my heart. I hope
00,01you go rot in Hell.

00,01If you have any
15,01         00sense, you'll know that on the foot
00,01the big toe is king.

00,01Called myself Candy,
15,01         00Put on breasts and a black dress.
00,01Don't call me bizarre.
