15,01< What is NationView? >
15,01NationView (NV) is a general file viewer.  It's not just an ANSi viewer.
15,01It currently supports text files, BIN format files, and 320x200 resolution
15,01PCX files.  Current display resolutions include 80x25 and 80x50 text modes,
15,01and 320x200x256 VGA mode.  NV also supports scrollback, variable speeds,
15,01slideshow, grey scale, ASCII mode, iCE color, the option to change the
15,01default file mask and path, and the ability to copy/move/delete files.
15,01NV has full command-line support, and also has full mouse support, even
15,01while viewing an image.  SAUCE v00 and ACiD's old description format are
15,01also supported.


15,01< Note >
15,01In the little info box on the right side in the middle of the screen is
15,01the current date and time, and the file's size.  The date and time are
15,01NOT the file's date and time, rather the CURRENT date and time.

15,01Note: When viewing a file, especially pure text files, the action may not
15,01      occurr immediately when you hit a key.  If there's a pause, it
15,01      shouldn't be too long, but there may be one.  The reason for this
15,01      is that keyboard and mouse checks are only done after 256 bytes have
15,01      been written to the screen.  The program would have been much too
15,01      slow if keyboard/mouse checks were done after every character was
15,01      printed.


15,01< Variable speeds >
15,01The variable speeds simulate baud rates.  Unlike other viewers, however, NV
15,01does not accurately simulate the baud rate.  NV only pauses after a character
15,01is printed to the screen, not after each character is read.  Also, you can
15,01change speed while viewing in ANSi if scrollback is inactive by hitting F4.
