00,01 Around me I see so many people too scared to care
00,01around me I see so amny people unaware
00,01 Sure this world's so full of problems
00,01we've got to take the time to sort them through
00,01 Yeah it might take some courage
00,01the answer lies within you

00,01  So why do you run
00,01  Why do you hide
00,01  From your feelings
00,01  so deep inside

00,01 We've all been faced with the wall of confusion
00,01so many times before
00,01 We've all had so many messed up feelings
00,01crashing down our door
00,01 Why keep looking for a way to get out
00,01instead look inside to find the truth
00,01 We've got face ourselves
00,01it's hard the hardest thing that I can do...
