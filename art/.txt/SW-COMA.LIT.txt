15,0111th Hour

15,01Living inside this comatose state,
15,01I cannot feel -- love or hate.
15,01No senses -- hear, touch, or smell,
15,01I'm living in a world, of such horrible hell.
15,01All I can do is pray, and wait,
15,01wish I would die, I have no fate.
15,01Completely surrounded by a dark, black space,
15,01I cannot recall, no path to trace.
15,01I try to imagine, what I could have done,
15,01to deserve such an evil, dark, outcome.
15,01I feel the walls quickly closing in,
15,01I think to myself - 'will this never end?'
15,01To me, there is absolutely nothing worse,
15,01then to have no clue, and even more, no course.
15,01I guess all I can do, is wait and endure,
15,01but deep down inside, I know there's no cure.
