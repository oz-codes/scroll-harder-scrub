15,01        Basilisk part one: "Shattered Visions of the Basilisk"

15,01     As I have grown up, I look upon people who turn to stone ... and watch
15,01my mind become shattered with seeds of progress, seeds of evolution, seeds of
15,01love and seeds of death.  I am the Basilisk... and what I see excites me
15,01enough to look deep into their eyes, whether the eyes be of paper or living
15,01tissue ... I look into them, and they turn to stone.  A stone brittle to the
15,01touch, impregnable to my mind... but I watch nonetheless.  I write in
15,01present-tense... ignoring that which has left my fingers to the plastic keys
15,01of this device before me ... ignoring if it makes sense to you, or to me ...
15,01and that is why I'm the Basilisk, as the beast gazes upon its victim... it
15,01turns to stone, and then the beast moves on in search of more... I consume
15,01knowledge, some fades... some impregnates my mind... and the rest is before
15,01me, or behind me in the past... but I have not seen it yet.  So I continue...

15,01     I remember a moment in my life, not too long ago when I was working at
15,01my local neighbourhood Video Store.  It was dull... but the movies around me
15,01acted like pillars of entertainment lining the vast Great Hall which is my
15,01world.  I view most of my life like an episode of "Dream On" but instead of
15,01showing my life as it goes, and the movies which I recollect... I include
15,01myself in those movies, wondering what was happening and why.  I see myself
15,01now... standing on sore feet, pondering what was to happen next in my
15,01subconscience, and I... being ignorant to its heed, but I remember at
15,01least... that is enough for you to know of what took place.  It was about 5
15,01in the morning, a little cold outside... but my clashing with its chill made
15,01a neutral calm to my body.  It was breakfast.  The sun was rising.  Another
15,01day was coming to an end.  As I returned from buying a Coke and some apple
15,01fritters, I turned towards the south as I heard a car alarm go off... and
15,01found nothing in sight except the long street... leaving my vision as gravity
15,01took its toll on the earth.  I reached into my pocket to retrieve my keys,
15,01and what should I sense... a yearning to look up.

15,01     Why I looked up... my mind is the keeper of secrets, dangling the keys
15,01in front of my face and laughing, but memories like this make my life grand,
15,01and rich ... but, they mask my thoughts for the future.  The sun was not in
15,01view, a few clouds were floating in the sky... background music to my eyes,
15,01and the sky was a richness of blue unlike any I could ever recall in my short
15,0120-year-old life.  At that point in my life, everything seemed clear... clear
15,01as crystal water showering forth from a mountain cliff, clear as the first
15,01day when you had your first kiss, clear as your mind is listening to your
15,01favourite music ... but what my eyes showed me was so limited.

15,01     The infra-red spectrum... how small it is in scale to what else exists
15,01in our small universe... all of it out there, and so little we know.  I would
15,01imagine what a gamma ray would look like, but in the book I was reading... it
15,01came up as strange, encryptic symbols ... that only a human mind could
15,01decipher... "Gamma Rays are..." and it went on like some insane raccoon that
15,01could talk, and was insistently telling you that everything had to be
15,01clean... spotless clean, and I think to myself now... "If only this raccoon
15,01knew what Mr. Clean was..."  I wonder what x-rays look like, but all I ever
15,01see is visions of myself which my mind cannot understand ... they say it's
15,01our body, but is it really our body ... or a vision that we as humans have
15,01not obtained.  Yin Yang, left right, top bottom, blind seeing, deaf hearing,
15,01stupid genius ... dichotomies all of them, and our mind is one huge intricate
15,01pattern of dichotomies ... but X-rays, well... they are a force of nature of
15,01which we can only put "pictures" and "letters" and "noises" to... to define
15,01its nature, that is what we do.  I think of what the stars would look like if
15,01you were inside of one, would everything be really bright and the stars...
15,01would they be black as pinholes in the searing light ahead of us.  So many
15,01millions of colours in this world that we perceive, and yet... the other
15,01spectrums ... they remain as "limbo" or a "parallel universe" that only the
15,01spectrums themselves have knowledge of... like elder entities in a pantheon
15,01of which only they can see.  We as humans can gain knowledge from further
15,01studying of these spectrums, but what are we learning ... are we only
15,01teaching ourselves that we will never be able to see that of which we
15,01learn... are we teaching ourselves how to see like this, and if so ... why?
15,01Is knowledge a stepping stone for evolution, or a skipping stone across a
15,01vast virtual-reality universe which picks up only that which we want to
15,01know, and leaves the rest like unwanted trash.  Alone... that blue sky made
15,01me wonder.

15,01     Admittedly, I cannot write poetry... it seems to simple and useless to
15,01contain such controlled thoughts.  Poetry is like one of those Coles' Notes on
15,01some great masterpiece of our past that someone wrote in vain so that you, the
15,01reader, could fully understand that which is being told.  I read now some
15,01poetry, a small blurb of lettering from the Coles' Notebook for "The Rape of
15,01the Lock"...
