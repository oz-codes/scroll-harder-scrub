15,01- Corruption -


15,01Power is a corrupting institution;
15,01Absolute control denies constitution.
15,01Pride will be your Achille's Heel
15,01As you sink inside the subversive surreal.

15,01Ambition brought you to where you are,
15,01But pride will pull you back as far.
15,01Ambition and pride - like yin and yang;
15,01One like a tear; the other a fang.

15,01Opposite pain and opposite power
15,01As corruption grows stronger by the hour.
15,01There is only so far that you strength can take you,
15,01Then your elusive ignorance will see fit to break you.

15,01It is in this hell that all things collide
15,01As the taint of corruption consumes you inside.
15,01This is how a life of power will end -
15,01Burried beneath the corruption of men.
