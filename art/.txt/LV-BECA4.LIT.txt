15,01iv.

15,01She's gone, she left this morning
15,01in a hasty whirlwind of departure
15,01I didn't even get to say good-bye
15,01now in vain I try...
15,01not to break down and cry.

15,01She's gone, 'tis a crushing blow
15,01and to where, I do not know
15,01The four winds will carry her
15,01wherever they may blow...
15,01off to a place I cannot go.

15,01Her absence gnaws at my soul
15,01and tears at my heartstrings
15,01Like a kitten clawing at a door
15,01trying to come in from the cold, see...
15,01I just wish she would have told me.

15,01I dare not close my eyes
15,01for when I do, I see her face
15,01against a black background of emptiness
15,01and my heart feels so out-of-place...
15,01as I wallow in disgrace.

15,01Wondering and hoping
15,01that maybe someday she'll return
15,01this beautiful girl for whom I yearn
15,01"Oh Rebecca, my heart withers for lack of thee...
15,01When whilst thou come back to me?"
