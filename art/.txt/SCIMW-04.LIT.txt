15,01. . .Black Thunder. . .



15,01Twilight; Midnight; Screams across the air.
15,01Bury my head inside my dreams and pray that hell can't find me there.

15,01Hope to God that the demons will flee,
15,01For only in silence can I be free.

15,01Yet I know that it will never be;
15,01The dreams will forever be with me.

15,01Outside my window, the tresses groan in the wind. . .
15,01Looks like it's time for another storm to begin.

15,01The pounding rain will hold me awake 'til the dawn;
15,01Plauged by living nightmares until the moon is gone.

15,01Banshee cries as the clouds rumble through the sky;
15,01Feeling in my gut that this is my night to die.

15,01Eyes seem to stare at me from every crevice and corner, dark;
15,01Every eyes staring straight through me, piercing to my heart.

15,01Wind is raging up again; There has to be somewhere to flee,
15,01Yet in truth, there is no escape - only insanity. . .

15,01Dark wind calls me and the lightning nears my bed;
15,01Voices seem to scream my name as they dance inside my head.

15,01I gaze out my window at the blazing spectral array,
15,01Hear the thunder roar, and know I'll never see the day.

15,01Black presence seems to encompass me; Dark fire burning;
15,01Flames envelope my sunken skin; raging, twisting and turning.

15,01In a final moment of hell, all my world is rent asunder;
15,01And I succumb to the chaotic bliss of the ear-shattering Black Thunder.
