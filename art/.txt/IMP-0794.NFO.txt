15,01                                   Welcome!

15,01          Ack, a busy month, and the first pack of summer, pretty cool,
15,01          Anyways, let me just start by welcoming our  new USHQ,  Psalm
15,01          69, and new US co-ord, Khyron.  If  there's  anyone in the US
15,01          that wants to apply to Imperial, feel free to bug him till he
15,01          bugs me =]

15,01                                 Ansi Ripping

15,01          Oh boy,  now,  here is a serious issue.  Maximum Overdose was
15,01          caught for ripping, and after seeing what he ripped, it was a
15,01          pretty bad job, I never spotted the ripping and his work went
15,01          in last months pack,  please unzip  the file MO-DLNOW.ZIP, he
15,01          shows his real talent in there.

15,01          Twisted Terrorist, well, I donno, I heard he had ripped ansis
15,01          but I also know  he's a talented artist,  I'm sure he'll be a
15,01          great addition, long as the work stays his own.

15,01+-----------------------.. .  .
15,01                                   Well...

15,01          Not much else to say, 'cept  NO MORE SITE APPLICATIONS, I get
15,01          so many each month, and it's rediculous. Uhm, things are good
15,01          and check out TN-GREET.ALL to check out this months greets.

15,01                             Welcome a second time!

15,01          This part  is sorta new.  It's called my part.  Some things I
15,01          wish to say or have to tell ya. Alot of things happenned this
15,01          month and it's probably why you've got this 850k or even more
15,01          pack with over  45 ansis, 8 gifs, 6 rips (do not confuse with
15,01          "ripping" :)

15,01                                 Zorlak, gone?

15,01          I'd like to say a big goodbye and thanks to Zorlak who always
15,01          did his best to make this group better. He worked really hard
15,01          for us,  he found  new  artists  and  coders  for us.  He was
15,01          dedicated to the group since the very beginning.  But a while
15,01          back he lost his touch and I had to tell him he couldn't stay
15,01          in Imperial anymore. It's been over 3 months I am supposed to
15,01          do this but there's a fact that he his sorta my friend and it
15,01          was really difficult  for me to tell him.  I decided to write
15,01          him  a message  but didn't  really know  what to write.  So I
15,01          plainly told him he was out. He has done alot,  but now he is
15,01          gone. I thank him  as much as I can for what  he did and wish
15,01          we'll still be friends.

15,01                            New Members from my side

15,01          Let's move to some other thing.  A group local to me [Liquid]
15,01          died a few  days ago. A  few members are  comming from there:
15,01          Benny, Cypher,  Disturbance and Voodoo.  They are really good
15,01          at what they do. They all have  something in this pack. Check
15,01          it out. I'd also like to welcome  Twisted Terrorrist who is a
15,01          former  iCE Artist.  He did a mistake  in ripping an ansi but
15,01          he knows what he did is wrong and will  never do it again. He
15,01          has some talent.  There's also  The Humanoid,  The Hornet and
15,01          Eerie which are new to the group.
