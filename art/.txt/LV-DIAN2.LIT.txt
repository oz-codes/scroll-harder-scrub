15,01The End

15,01Soft as the gentle breeze
15,01blowing on her face,
15,01her skin glows with vibrance,
15,01perfect in every place.
15,01Flawless femininity,
15,01untouched by any wrong.
15,01A living, breathing goddess,
15,01her night-black hair so long.
15,01Her motions are so graceful,
15,01her subtle moves, angelic.
15,01A timeless piece of beauty,
15,01a priceless, gorgeous relic.

15,01As I gaze at her in wonder,
15,01entranced by what I see,
15,01I also feel the pain
15,01because she'll never notice me.
15,01Never stopping for a second,
15,01she continues on her way.
15,01And it kills me deep inside
15,01because I know she will not stay.

15,01The ones whom she will stop for
15,01have underhanded ways to bait her.
15,01And the grief inside me thickens,
15,01for they don't appreciate her.
15,01Never realizing her beauty,
15,01never savoring a glance,
15,01simply taking her for granted
15,01but she still gives them their chance

15,01Don't you think it's quite ironic?
15,01What a sick turn of events!
15,01For the one who DOES respect her
15,01is imprisoned in a fence!
15,01But not a fence of metal,
15,01she creates this one herself,
15,01and tosses him aside
15,01like an old book on a shelf.

15,01Do they not see what I see?
15,01Can they not take it to heart?
15,01Alas, my time with her is over
15,01before it even got its start.
15,01So as I travel through the summer,
15,01searching for what I won't find,
15,01she will not be my companion
15,01just a memory in my mind.
