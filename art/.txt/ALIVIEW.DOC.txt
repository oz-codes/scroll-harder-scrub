15,01    ALiViEW was coded specifically to be included as a viewing utility
15,01for ALiVE productions. Although lacking in many high rez features common
15,01to a lot of viewers out there, it maintains some unique features of it's
15,01own. This includes-

15,01  # Full Sound Card Support for .MOD play
15,01  # Variable Volume Control
15,01  # Internal .GIF routines
15,01       . Rez 640x480x256+ require VESA support
15,01  # Shells out to DeadView for RiP Support
15,01  # Easy to use Interface


15,01    We regret the fact that higher resolution ansi viewing is not included
15,01in this months version but we promise it will be included in months upcoming
15,01along with scrollback and a host of unique VGA routines. Hopefully, we'll get
15,01a decent looking .DOC file too. ;)
