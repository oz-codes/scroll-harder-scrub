15,01Ok, lemme see here STiLE complaining I ripped an ANSi off of Tempus Thales?? 
15,01haha..sure..ok for one, Why in the world would I take an ANSi made by an 
15,01artist as well known all over the ANSi seen and change it around? Sheesh 
15,01come on, especially one that had been around and seen so many times! That
15,01is total ludicris! 

15,01        Some other things, STiLE said that I had showed him some of my work
15,01when I called his board, that was true. BUT what he neglected to tell you was
15,01that the work I showed him was done a little over a month and a half ago, oh
15,01there was one ANSi <Pic of a man, with grey hair and grey skin in a red robe> 
15,01which had a cheap EViL logo on it and a member list, that wasn't even 
15,01finished, the pic wasn't done, and the logo and member list wasn't up to date
15,01<although the member list doesn't matter> the logo was done in about 2 mins
15,01, which didn't matter much anyways cause I am not the greatest person at
15,01drawing fonts. SO the proof STiLE has to my ability is held in ANSi's that
15,01are almost two months old!! <I showed them to SHaRP also, due to the fact of
15,01a HD crash, which also crashed my BBS which is down, and will go back up, I
15,01didn't have anything recent other then the EVIL Member list>

15,01        And also, when I had called, I had expressed an interest in joining
15,01iCE, that was around early July. That is also when I showed him my art from
15,01a few months back. He took a look at my art and said it looked good, he said
15,01and I qoute, "From the looks of these, you will be an awesome artist!" 
15,01<not an exact quoute because I hadn't stopped to screen image it because I 
15,01never thought I would need to defend that>. He also said I would be possibly
15,01able to join iCE in about a month. I didn't like that. I was happy at EViL
15,01but it was too small for my liking, and we didn't get enough exposure. So 
15,01what did I do? I called The Dark Society and logged on, filled the new user
15,01stuff out, and was pulled into chat by SHARP. He saw me put in my New user 
15,01msg that I was an artist and possibly interested in joining ACiD. After
15,01he took a look at <and once again the OVER A MONTH OLD> ANSi's I had done,
15,01and said he liked them. He then gave me an assignment. I took it on quickly
15,01as it was a chance I dont think I would have gotten again. 

15,01        I logged off his board, and got to work immediatley on the ANSi. I 
15,01worked on it till about 12:30 am and then said screw it I will finish it later
15,01I then went to bed. At about 8 am I woke up and once again began work on it.
15,01I worked till about 5pm <or was it 4?> and then I was finished. I then called
15,01Dark Society and showed SHARP what I had made. He like it, and said, "Welcome 
15,01to ACiD" :)

15,01        I then immediatley got to work on my second ACiD ansi <which will be
15,01out soon STiLE so you can look at it, if you dont believe in my ability!>. 
15,01I then learned, after calling Dark Society, that STiLE HAD CALLED..SHARP had
15,01said he was saying something about me ripping off the Tempus ANSi. Once again
15,01Why in the hell would I rip off an ansi made by someone in iCE, someone as
15,01well known as Tempus Thales, or any other ANSi for that matter!

15,01        I can only assume that STiLE was disgruntled that I applied to ACiD
15,01after asking about iCE, maybe he wanted me in iCE? Who knows. I only did 
15,01what I thought was best for me, and ACiD happened to be it. So like you can
15,01see I joined ACiD.

15,01        Also, I had sent him a msg after I had joined ACiD that said I had 
15,01  joined ACiD. Where the hell did he get the :AND THAT IF PERSUADED I MAY 
15,01  COME TO iCE" I do not know. ACiD is best for me, I have no interest know of 
15,01  going to iCE. 

15,01        I ONLY HOPE THAT SHARP, RaD MaN, and the rest of the ACiD staff will
15,01  put trust in me, and let me stay in ACiD after this incident <which by the
15,01  way STiLE can not prove that that is not my work!>, as once again...right 
15,01  now ACiD is where I want to be.


15,01        I know this has been long, but that was of no concern to me when it
15,01  came to defending my work, which I know is off the quality that ACiD wants.
15,01  I have no hard feeling towards, iCE and this is not aimed at starting some
15,01  sort of war between me and iCE. iCE has ALOT of talent, I mean just look
15,01  at guys like, the one and only, TEMPUS THALES, then there is LiQUiD iMAGE,
15,01  Lord Carnuss, and STiLE, and the rest of the bunch. 
15,01        
15,01        ANd STiLE said that people shoulld do more original stuff then
15,01Comic Characters.. uh hum STiLE, that was my only comic character <oops I
15,01do have a SPAWN one> that I have done. How many has Li done???????? 
15,01how many has iCE in a whole done?? I would have to say, well, ALOT! How many
15,01has ACiD done? They have done some too...but they haven't done as many as
15,01iCE.

15,01        Once again go back to the paragraph above stating my feeling towards
15,01iCE, they have not changed.
