15,01iCE: Tell us a bit about yourself. First name, age, hobbies, etc.

15,01DaVinci: My name is Sam, and I'm 50 years old.  I have quite a few hobbies
15,01         and interests, including graphics (of course), metal working and
15,01         engraving, ham radio, music, photography, computers, and more.  I
15,01         played music professionally for nine years, and play bass and
15,01         guitar, but my main axe is 5-string bluegrass banjo.  I also teach
15,01         banjo.

15,01iCE: How long have you been a member of iCE?

15,01DaVinci: I think I joined in 1998. That sounds about right.

15,01iCE: Where are you from? Have you lived anywhere else?

15,01DaVinci: I live in rural Louisiana and have lived in Michigan, Maryland,
15,01         Florida, and Georgia.

15,01iCE: What do you do for a living?

15,01DaVinci: I'm a hand engraver by profession.  I've been engraving longer
15,01         than my iCE members have been alive ;)  I also teach 6 one-week
15,01         engraving classes a year in Kansas.  When I'm not engraving here
15,01         in my own studio or teaching classes, I'm probably at a jewelry
15,01         show demonstrating engraving and diamond setting techniques.  I've
15,01         worked in Switzerland, China, Italy, Hong Kong, and in 2003 I'll
15,01         be in Japan and Thailand as well as shows here in the USA.

15,01iCE: We understand you've had some success at that.  You've had some of
15,01     your works on the cover of magazines?

15,01DaVinci: In Feb. 1984 a set of guns I engraved were on the cover of
15,01         American Rifleman magazine.  My work's been in books and magazines
15,01         for many years.  I'm very fortunate to have studied under two of
15,01         the world's best hand engravers.

15,01iCE: You played music professionally for 9 years? Can you tell us about 
15,01     that?

15,01DaVinci: My band was together for 9 years, and we started out playing
15,01         hardcore traditional bluegrass music.  Back in 1973 when we
15,01         started, bluegrass was the rage and we had all the work we could
15,01         take.  Then it slowly faded from popularity and we changed gears
15,01         and did country, progressive country, and even some cajun/zydeco
15,01         music.  I played banjo the first 4 years and electric bass the
15,01         last 5 years we were together.  Since we played in very popular
15,01         clubs in New Orleans, I had the opportunity to jam with some
15,01         interesting people.  A couple of names I can drop are John
15,01         Belushi, who sang with us every night for a week around 1975, and
15,01         Peter Townsend of The Who.  There are others, but those two are
15,01         memorable.

15,01         I got very serious with my engraving hobby and when the band
15,01         parted ways in 1982, I began working full time as a hand engraver.
15,01         I was "discovered" you might say, by a wealthy gun collector in
15,01         New Orleans who liked my work and thought I had potential.  He
15,01         employed me for 7 years to engrave his personal gun collection.
15,01         He sent me to Italy to study under the best engraver there, and I
15,01         also studied under another engraver here in the USA who was
15,01         considered one of the best in the world.  My employer was a patron
15,01         to the arts.  He never demanded anything but my very best work,
15,01         and I was never under any time constraints to complete jobs.  I
15,01         had the security of a weekly paycheck and complete artistic and
