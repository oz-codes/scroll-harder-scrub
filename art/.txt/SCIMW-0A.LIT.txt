15,01- Devolution of Misery -



15,01Something in the stillness calls
15,01Tendrils wrap my soul and draw
15,01me over the walls and across the sea;
15,01The sea I've hollowed from misery.

15,01Misery just hold me.

15,01Something in the stillness awakens
15,01As I near the light that's shaken
15,01me from my trance and from my fears;
15,01The light that's washed away my tears.

15,01Misery just love me.

15,01I walk to the door, beneath the plaque;
15,01The sign that reads, "There's no turning back."
15,01And I open the door, despite the sign,
15,01And everything freezes to a moment in time.

15,01Misery just reach me.

15,01I stand at a land far beyond measure;
15,01A valley of peace that's beyond mortal treasure.
15,01It's a place where all dreams take root and grow;
15,01A place that erases the tears that you've known.

15,01Misery just stand near me.

15,01Something posesses me, though I know not why;
15,01A joy springs in me from way down inside;
15,01I laugh and I dance and I reach for the sun;
15,01And I catch it and hold it and feel that I've won.

15,01Misery just walk away.

15,01I'm one with the sky and I'm one with the air;
15,01Everything is ONE in this new atmosphere;
15,01I reached the place that all men hope to find;
15,01And now that I've found it, this new life is mine.

15,01Misery just run from me.

15,01I stand on a mountain, bejeweled with ice,
15,01And stare down from above on this paradise;
15,01I smile and a peace wells up from inside;
15,01I've been purged of my fear and healed of my pride.

15,01Misery, I've denied you.

15,01I'm a new creation; past that holy door;
15,01I'm a part of a heaven - there can be nothing more;
15,01I stand under the sky, as the stars sing in tune;
15,01And my soul is illumined by the white Harvest Moon.

15,01Misery is no more.
