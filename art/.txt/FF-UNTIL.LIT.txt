15,01The joy and comfort brings a feather bed below me,
15,01Only the demention of the trust conceals the poisoned barbs 
15,01hidden within. 
15,01True to the past experiences has my mind grown,
15,01Making me ever more prepared and ever more in danger,
15,01of losing the thing I value most.
15,01And only in vast infinate expanses of time can the barbs be 
15,01done away with,
15,01And only with help of ultimate forces that pull back the 
15,01sheets woven with dishonesty and make the process complete,
15,01The seed has been planted deep and furtivly,
15,01Embeded in fertil soil and flourished with the waters of love 
15,01and the sunlight of revealing.
15,01The seed breaks its shell and its roots go deep,
15,01deep into the vast expanses of the earth and forever upward 
15,01towads the place of judgement.
