15,01        Here we are again.  This is 'Visions of Reality (VOR)'s third pack.  
15,01Again, it's been a busy month.  An additional senior member was added to the
15,01list.  Congradulate Hollow Point if you see him.  Not only is he a great ANSI
15,01artist, but he has shown great leadership skills while heading the ANSI divi-
15,01sion.  This month people were held back because of mid-terms.  I know, excuses
15,01don't do any good, but people have been busy studying all month.  In the end,
15,01we still got the job done for the month and have quite a bit for the pack.  
15,01We have decided that we are going to release the mods in a seperate pack, for
15,01last month, the mods made up over one meg of pack (which was large enough so
15,01that the couriers (TURBINE) had to cut the whole pack by a meg).  Not much
15,01has gone on internally for us besides for the promotion of HP.  We have a
15,01new application generator, thanks to Asterix.  I'm not going to waste your
15,01time anymore with telling you guys about our backround (read the other nfo 
15,01files in our other packs for that), so I guess that's it.  I'll let the pack
15,01say the rest.

15,01        I must say that we've come a long way from when we began with only
15,01four members about half a year ago. I would like to say that VOR is very
15,01sorry about creating a pack that was just way too big. We hope that our
15,01efforts this month with shortening the pack help the couriers & the average
15,01user with less of a hassle to download our pack. Another thing I would like
15,01to mention is that VOR will be mentioned in the upcoming release of
15,01corruption. Thanks to CX, for allowing us to present an article about us and
15,01all. This pack is kinda small this month due to quite a few reasons. Mainly
15,01because of semester finals, and also due to several internal changes.
15,01Overall though it seems that this pack has improved quite a bit. Hollow
15,01Point again has managed to produce a hell of a lot more ansi's than anyone
15,01else in the group, creating a sort of imbalance, but with excellent art as
15,01always. One more thing I would like to mention is that VOR now has two
15,01seperate packs. One for art, and the other filled with kick-ass MODs created
15,01by our composers. So be sure to check out that mod pack.
15,01That's all I've got for now...enjoy the pack.
