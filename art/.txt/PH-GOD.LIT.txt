15,01I am feeling so fucked man...
15,01the keyboard is to loud, and so is the fan...
15,01the band is trippin, my mind is like goo...
15,01too tragically stoned, how bout you???

15,01I have no direction, no sense of space,
15,01no sense of time, I've melted my face...
15,01I can't make broth, I can't feel my tooth...
15,01too tragically stoned, how bout you......

15,01how bout you.... you.... you.....


15,01not I, said the final king...
15,01I did not deny you, I followed your every whim...
15,01'But you did not' said the reborn, son of man...
15,01'But forgive I shall, for perfection is not'
15,01'Made for man, to grasp, with only on shot'
15,01'but carried on in another life you shall see'
15,01'emptiness, tears, loneliness, all banished from thee...'

15,01He left in a flash, remembered within
15,01my darker heart, beats yet again...
15,01I awake in my horror, half past noon...
15,01'where did my day go? Why so soon?'
15,01I lept to the ready, set for a war
15,01but received only the knocks of the police at the door...

15,01'you are a criminal, and it is your paying time'
15,01'Death only suits you, to act like the mime'
15,01'your head shall be severed left in its blood'
15,01'for crows to pick your eyes, and wash their beaks in a flood'
15,01'for the lands will be quaked, and seas will die'
15,01'Your soul to be spared, only to realize'
15,01'your mind is too fragile, to burn like a light'
15,01'I come to snatch you away, like a thief in the night...'

15,01And so it all ended, I left from my place
15,01And rose to the skies, to see what judgement I face...
15,01All is forgiven, cry out no more...
15,01forget the blood stains you left on the floor...

15,01Live in peace in here, within the hallowed walls...
15,01the chambers of gold and rainbow falls...
15,01I must stop, I can't take anymore...
15,01My mind aches in places I knew not from before...

15,01talk to you after another fine session of stoning....

15,01PurP a DurP Le HahZee...
15,01ha ha, silly english pigdog....
15,01shloop shloop shloop (it would sound better if you hear me play it for you in
15,01the protein and water container shell I call flesh...)
