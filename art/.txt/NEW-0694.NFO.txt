15,01  Introduction
15,01        
15,01        Havok has suffered some major setbacks this month, which range        
15,01        from loss of users, to loss of artwork, to lack of motivation.
15,01        Havok continues to exist, however, shows some very unworthy
15,01        artists as of lately..

15,01New Members:
15,01        
15,01        New members include Buckwheat.  He has joined us from spLat, which
15,01        broke up towards the end of the month.  He joins us as a coder, and
15,01        shows some great skill in coding.
15,01        
15,01Members resigning:
15,01        
15,01        Ozzy has left us, who joined from the iLLUSiON Merge.  Where he plans
15,01        to go, and what he plans to do is unknown, but fortunately he leaves
15,01        us on good terms.
15,01        Asrael has left our RIP department, leaving for ACiD Productions, 
15,01        who offered him to draw for them.
15,01        Mr. Corruption has left us to form his own group, Fury.  We wish 
15,01        him the best of luck.
15,01        Techie has left us for the time being to code a viewer for CiA
15,01        who is paying him 50$ to do so, which is more than we offered
15,01        him.  Coding is a HUGE setback for Havok once again.  So if you
15,01        have the talent, please give us a call.

15,01Artwork: 

15,01        In RIP this month, we are back to what we started with, ONE RIP
15,01        artist, our 2nd artist who came from iLLUSiON, Asrael, got an
15,01        offer from ACiD and accepted.  Good luck Asrael.
15,01        
15,01        VGA work is slow this month, showing very little work.  VGA Art
15,01        is limited in Havok, as we lack in VGA Artists.
15,01        However, Zaphod has been elected as Head of VGA Art, and did some
15,01        fantastic work this month.

15,01        Nightbreed again shows an outstanding collection of ANSi work this
15,01        month.  Incredible job NB.  Sword Weaver as well continues to
15,01        amaze us with his outstanding work, however minimal due to college
15,01        entrance exams.  He plans to start drawing more again this month.
15,01        He contiues to show that he can also do origional artwork, and 
15,01        not copy from Comic books. :)
15,01        Nightbreed has been nominated Head of ANSi Art.  Congradulations
15,01        NB!

15,01        The Lit department is again very solid, with Zaphod contributing 
15,01        another large quantities of work, as well as quality.  Destiny
15,01        has continued to amaze me with her truly origional poetry, and the
15,01        ability to make a poem not only sound good, but have appeal to the
15,01        vision as well.  Destiny has accepted the position of Head of
15,01        Literture department.
