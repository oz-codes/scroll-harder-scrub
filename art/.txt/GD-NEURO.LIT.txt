00,01Neurosis

00,01Rising light blinds my eyes
00,01I think I've been hypnotized
00,01Tell me the truth don't lie, no lies

00,01Through the light I see its face
00,01Letme borrow some of your mace
00,01Aim high hit him in the face

00,01Darkness consumes light, run the sinned
00,01Never stop keep running on the wind
00,01Light as a feather I have sinned

00,01The weather here it's come
00,01Bring courage yes I need some
00,01But only if it weighed a ton

00,01Hidden I hide, bitten I could die
00,01Neurotic maybe psychotic, not I
00,01So I lay down and then I kiss the sky
