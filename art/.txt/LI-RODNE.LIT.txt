15,01Steve was panting as he ran around the corner, the pack of wild lemmings hot on
15,01his tail.

15,01Of course, Steve was an evolved monkey so he didn't have a tail, and the
15,01lemmings' body temperature was no higher than normal, and so they were not hot.
15,01 They were simply following him and doing a very efficiant job of it.

15,01Suddenly Steve turned into a socket wrench and dropped to the ground.  "This
15,01will fool them, " he thought.

15,01Much to his dismay, it did not, and the lemmings tied six hundred pounds of
15,01napalm to his body.  The lemmings got to a safe distance before detonating
15,01Steve.  Contrary to popular belief, lemmings are not suicidal.  They are simply
15,01avid, although poorly skilled, cliff divers.

15,01The lemmings were all identical, except for the ones that weren't.  Some of
15,01them had short tails, and so did the rest.

15,01One of the lemmings spoke up, "Hey guys!  Let's all go cliff diving!"  And so
15,01they all proceeded to jump off a cliff.

15,01Rodney, one of the lemmings who was different, managed to swim back to shore.
15,01Since all his friends were dead, he assumed he had done something wrong.  So he
15,01tried it again.  And swam back to shore again.  Somehow, Rodney had
15,01inadvertently learned to swim.

15,01He went back to the lemming village, sad and dejected, and lightly salted.
15,01When the other lemmings saw that he was sad and alone, they asked, "What's the
15,01name of that broad who hosts the Today Show?"

15,01Rodney detested sexism, and the use of the word "broad," and so he shot them
15,01all.  He was also strictly against violence, so he shot himself.  Or at least
15,01he tried to, but the gun was empty.

15,01And so, Rodney, the lucky lemming who learned to swim, packed his trunk and
15,01left town, and set off to make his fortune in Pittsburgh, working in the smog
15,01factories.

15,01Pittsburgh was reknowned for its smog factories, and was one of the biggest
15,01suppliers of such polluted cities as Los Angeles, Hamilton and Pitt Meadows.
15,01He knocked on the door of the large, imposing building, which looked very much
15,01like the earth was smoking a cigar.  A large, fat, bald, skinny man opened the
15,01door and looked out.  Seeing no one, he slammed the door and went back to his
15,01office.

15,01Mustering his courage, Rodney knocked again.  This time, however, the result
15,01was different.  The door opened the fat, bald, skinny man, spilling the man's
15,01intestines all over the floor of the factory.  This made the janitor very
15,01unhappy, because it was the floor's day off, and the janitor was filling in for
15,01it.

15,01Rodney tiptoed across the bloody janitor, peeking around corners so as not to
15,01startle any indigenous lemmings, as Pittsburgh was known in the lemming world
15,01as a bad neighbourhood.

15,01Rodney found nothing in the factory, apart from the day's production of smog,
15,01and Mrs. Schmidt.  He immediately threw her in a bucket of smog by-products for
15,01being an anti-semitist.  Rodney hated anti-semitists even more than he hated
15,01prejudiced people.

15,01Rodney was a lemming.  A big fat lemming.  A rotund little rodent with swimming
15,01goggles and a toothpick.

15,01No he wasn't.  He was actually quite tall and fit for a lemming, which was why
15,01he had been employed as a bouncer at the local dance 'n' drown club.  Until
15,01they all died.

15,01Much to Rodney's surprise, his legs all fell off.  So did his head.  This was
15,01rather embarrassing, as there was nothing sharp in the vicinity to blame it on.
15,01 So Rodney accepted his little physical challenge and went on about his life,
15,01with prosthetic limbs fashioned out of Jiffy markers, and a false head make
15,01from wadded up kleenex.

15,01Suddenly, a rather irate floor-shaped janitor killed him stone dead with a
15,01smoking, twisted socket wrench.  Ironically, 2000 miles away, the same thing
15,01happened to a small patch of lichen with a hacking cough named plastic.
