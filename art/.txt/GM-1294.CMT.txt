15,01   Another great month for Lapse musically! I love how our music
15,01section is rocking so badly.. ( I love how the other divisions rock
15,01too, but since I'm the senior music guy.. <g>) 
15,01    Big thanks go out to the usual people, but special thanks
15,01go out to Red Flame, Ghent, and Insanitor.. The three major musicians.
15,01As of this next pack, we have a new talented music member. His name
15,01is Fizban.. He was a member of the art group FoP, which was the previous
15,01local big art group before it broke up.. We're pleased to have him on
15,01board, as he has done some great stuff, and seems really enthusiastic
15,01about being in the group. Welcome Fizban!
15,01    I've been getting a lot of feedback on Internet from people who
15,01like what we've been doing.. I appreciate all of it. I always answer
15,01mail, so feel free to send me, or any other members, some mail...
15,01    And of course, I always encourage people to apply. If you join
15,01lapse, you can look forward to support in every way.. Need some samples?
15,01We have a huge collection available for download, that are lapse originals.
15,01And more coming out all the time.. Want some critique? If you're serious
15,01about improving, you should be willing accept criticism.. And here in 
15,01lapse, we'll give it to you.. Not "It sucks" criticism, but CONSTRUCTIVE
15,01criticism.. The blunt facts, is that if you join lapse, you'll join an
15,01atmosphere that will help you improve.. Most of the scene will freely
15,01admit that it is only their egos they are looking to support.. And while
15,01I admit it's nice to be recognized, that's not the chief reason I'm doing
15,01this i-net art group stuff.. The bottom line, is that if you join lapse,
15,01you will IMPROVE faster than in other groups. So feel free to apply.
15,01   Anyways.. Enjoy the pack.
