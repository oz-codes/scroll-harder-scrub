09,01Shadows: Atmosphere is Dead



11,01Wrapt in lightful wrathed splendour, oft a wondrous sky of crimsonesque stars.
11,01The shadows take their place of mark,
11,01O'er a loved cloud atop the Mount of Evermore.

11,01Silent in the bright of snow, that enraptures every crevice and crack.
11,01Twisted and bent, like a broken-knotted crag,
11,01O'er the dark of every knife-bladed grass.

11,01Unholy wreathe about this red legacious peak, oft a dying air of black.
11,01The light here has no place of mark,
11,01Atop their mountain of blood-drenched ice.

00,01 03Mystery Beholds the Dark

11,01Lightning strikes the cold midnight atmosphere.
11,01Thunder rolls and quakes the ground below.
11,01A terrorful shriek pounds about the dirted floor:
11,01A siren sounds into the ambience of this grasping darkness.
11,01Ceases; where it stays, the sound is gone.
11,01Nothing more and nothing less. Absolute silence.
11,01All seems to fall and drown in the enveloping fog.
11,01Cloaked figures look to float above the earth.
11,01Though keeping every step as even as the next.
11,01And keeping every foot as light as air.
11,01They ritually walk into these infinite clouds.
11,01Going nowhere they continue forever.
11,01On and on toward the blinding fog and soon therein.
11,01They disappear.

03,01 Resurrected Emptiness

11,01The silence now ceas'd its dreadful reign.
11,01And all has returned to what was once known.
11,01The fog diseased no longer enveloping all.
11,01The light now resurrected and living on.
11,01Sounds of a past forgotten taking hold of reality.
11,01The shores of oceans now laden with consuming waters.
11,01The trees breezily braying and greeting the winds.
11,01The songs of the sky are melodically praying above.
11,01So empty of meaning and of feeling.
11,01I have come to reason with myself.
11,01Have thrown my soul into the dim, stark pits that smother the valleys.
11,01Reality has taken hold of my past.
11,01Everything has destroyed me.
11,01And I am lost.

11,01The symphony crashes over in my mind.
11,01Like the bloody thrashing of sword on grind.
11,01Not found, a heart, within my chest.
11,01Forever, my soul, it cannot rest.
