15,01   We   had  lots  of  happenings  this  month. +-----------------------------+
15,01We   lost   several   members,   for   example: |                             |
15,01Flame, Caithor, Nos, etc.                       | Here is supposed to be a    |
15,01And  we  had  only  two  new members:  Ize  and | pic.  You know,  those      |
15,01Influx. Welcome.                                | fucking smallscales ACiD    |
15,01                                                | has.  But,  since I just    |
15,01   That's pretty sad,   and  more  sadder  will | didn't fucking feel like it |
15,01be noticing  the  truth,   that  this  pack  is | there isn't.  You have a    |
15,01one   of the smallest   in    blend    history. | mind of yourself,  use it.  |
15,01People    have REALLY  lost  their inspiration. | Imagine something here,     |
15,01I gotta say that  no  leader  can run his group | fuck I don't give a shit    |
15,01by himself.   He must  have  all members beside | what,  JUST SOMETHING.      |
15,01him. Members MUST draw, to get the group running.                             |
15,01So.. I don't know what else to say, but: DRAW!@ | We killed our photographer  |
15,01Gain the inspiration from for  example some old |                             |
15,01ansi-packets, like Integrity, Legend, Bleach..  +-----------------------------+
15,01they were all good.   And acctually this   was   not   for only blend members.
15,01This goes for whole scene aswell.  You are just a bunch of lazy people preten-
15,01ding to have some art skills. Goddammit, DRAW!@ (Yes, you might say: 'Look who
15,01is talking!' and that's right..  I'm here just cheating myself, trying to show
15,01up as an active artist, but so what? :))

15,01   Anyway,   this   month  has  been  diffrent  beside  regular  months  also;
15,01We  had some serious conversation about merging scenes two best groups,  blend
15,01and shade.   Acctually we already almost merged,   but then I realised that we
15,01promised to stick up with blend forver when we started this group.   So I felt
15,01myself like cheap betrayer...  And also I got several suggestions not to merge
15,01because too many good groups have died because stupid merges.  This is nothing
15,01personal tho... Tankgirl  said  he  would  have  left  blend if we had merged.
15,01And we would have lost other people too i guess.   So I called the whole thing
15,01off. Btw, again you see my dicdature;  I  was  deciding  for whole group about
15,01this merge.  So feel free to send me "fuck you"-messages.  I've deserved them.
15,01And  so  we  are  here  again  pretending  we have faith on this group. Well..
15,01I guess we have bit faith.. or something.

15,01   Well, i guess that was all. Nothing more to say except; dig Blend, read
15,01Acrylic and hang in Irc 'till you get bored.

15,01   What's wrong with you!+  Motherfuckers!  When  I look at this god damn pack,
15,01I  feel  fucking  ashamed to be in THIS GOD DAMN GROUP!  Ok,  maybe I'm not the
15,01most active drawer,  but HELL!  Atleast I do  something.   So you motherfucking
15,01cunts better start drawing  if  you wanna stay in this group.  If  you   "don't
15,01feel like drawing",  JOIN ACID.  JOIN ICE,  fuck I don't care.  But  the future
15,01of this group lies on you people.
15,01   And yes,  Fuck you kelthar,  fuck the whole fucking shade.  YOU SUCK (this
15,01doesn't include Dfuse of course),  YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A PIECE OF SHIT!!!  Just
15,01die (please).  Tank you.

15,01   <Last minute note> Draw real pics,  not some stinking logos which suck
15,01anyway.  YOU CAN'T BEAT IODINE,  so don't even bother to try.
