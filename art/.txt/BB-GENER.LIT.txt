15,01baby, I'll go over to your house
15,01I'm sure your room's immaculate
15,01let me guess- a pop group poster on the north wall, 
15,01and an almost-risque model on the other

15,01oh, we've viewed one another from afar
15,01and yet four feet away, fleetingly
15,01A chasm separates us
15,01And I'm trying to cross it in inches

15,01can you sate me?
15,01can you enjoy me?
15,01can you ignore me?
15,01and might I say the same about you?

15,01and when we bond nervously, superficially,
15,01I'll feel a flicker of hate
15,01And then an immeasurable warmth
15,01to know I've accomplished my goal
