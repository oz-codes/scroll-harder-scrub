00,01We15ll, Folks, here it is.. Blade pak number 3. Its the biggest pak yet, as
00,01fa15r as bits and bytes go, but as you can probably see by know, the ansi
00,01la15cks in quantity. However, I dont think you'll be too dissapointed with
00,01th15e quality.

00,01Th15is month we picked up a few new members. First off, Janzik Darkness
00,01jo15ins us from CiA as an ANSi and Lit Artist. Secondly, Morpheus joins our
00,01la15cking code department and livens things up there a bit, as you can see
00,01wi15th our new appgen by him. Mystic Plague joins us in the Lit dept., making
00,01th15at section the strongest so far; we welcome him and his excellent artistic
00,01ab15ility.

00,01As 15I mentioned up there (^), we now have a new appgen, complete with
00,01mu15sical interludes. Thanks to morpheus for the excellent coding, and StyX
00,01fo15r the entertaining MODs...

00,01A 15few other little notes: We excepted several new distro sites and member
00,01bo15ards this month, and that about completes that section. Blade is NO LONGER
00,01ac15cepting distro sites within the united states. Other countries are welcome
00,01to 15apply for hq positions, limit one per country.

00,01Th15at about wraps that shit up... Thanks to all who have helped to support
00,01bl15ade thus far, we hope to kick some serious ass in the coming months.
00,01If 15ya like our work, let us know.. I'm insecure about this shit ;)...
00,01Wr15ite me at internet MCBLADE@DELPHI.COM  or call Eternal Insanity
00,0190158.224.8780 NUP:SPHERE ....
00,01An15d as always, if you would like to apply for blade, fill out an app and
00,01se15nd it up to MindCrime at either of those two places above. Well known
00,01ar15tists need not fill out an app, we general know who you are.
00,01Bl15ade welcomes talented artists of all speeds, with no shit and no
00,01ha15ssles. All we ask is that ya work during the month and upload it to
00,01th15e whq in time for the pak. Besides that, yer free to do what ya want.
00,01(B15TW - BLADE SS is not a bunch of assholes.. For some reason i thought that
00,01ha15d to be said. ;)  )

00,01La15stly, Blade would like to bid a fond farewell to Gothic. Their work was
00,01se15cond to none, and they'll be missed. (And all leftover Gothic artists
00,01ar15e free to join blade ;) <God I hate sounding like we're desperate>)

00,01We15llllllllll.. That wraps that up... Lates until next month.
