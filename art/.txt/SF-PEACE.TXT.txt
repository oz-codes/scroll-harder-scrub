15,01   Fuck it! That's all I gotta say. I hate to piss and moan, but there
15,01   is more bad blood in the Scene than in the Gaza Strip. It seems everyone
15,01   exists just to get back at someone else. Many people are tiring of the
15,01   whole thing and quitting. I don't know if it's due to maturity levels,
15,01   cuz I don't know age averages or anything, or just really big egos.
15,01   I have noticed on thing though, it's evident in the ANSi world more
15,01   than any other. It seems that hackers, musicians, pirates and VGA artists
15,01   can get along, but give a bunch of ANSi guys some time and they will
15,01   acquire some enemies. I want to stop short and say that I know most
15,01   artists can and do get along with each other, also I know that flame
15,01   wars have been around alot longer than I have, but still...can't we
15,01   all just get along? I want to give three cheers to everyone out there
15,01   who can peacefully coexist with his fellow artist
