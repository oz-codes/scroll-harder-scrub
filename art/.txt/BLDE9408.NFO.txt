11,01  00T15his is the Blade Info File. 00A 15monthly publication from Blade Productions.
15,01  00T15his file outlines the past months happenings of Blade.................
15,01  00T15his text is written by MindCrime, Blade founder and president. 00I15f there
15,01  are any spelling or grammatical errors within this text, please remember
15,01  that MC is only human, as are most other people. 00B15lade is a group much like
15,01  that of iCE or ACiD [At least, we like to think so] which releases a monthly
15,01  pak of the prior months work [Or something like that]. 00B15lade paks are released
15,01  on the first of each month [They can be found at any one of our lovely
15,01  distribution sites]. If you wish to contact Blade in any way, please
15,01  call Eternal Insanity @ 908.224.8780; All blade members can be reached
15,01  on Ei. 00I15f you like the work of Blade, let us know. 00L15eave a message to
15,01  MindCrime at his lame ass internet address............[MCBLADE@DELPHI.COM]
15,01  or call up Eternal Insanity . 00E15njoy the pack.


15,01  00115] First off this month, an extremely talented artist by the name of 00Facsimile
15,01     joins up with Blade. We know Fac will be a most excellent addition, as can
15,01     be told by his debut work this month. Great job Fac!

15,01  00215] Still absent from the active member list this month is 00Soul Seeker 15and
15,01     Shadow Master <Who has changed his handle to 00Counterpoint15>. 00Mystic Plague
15,01     is back around, but so far no work from him. Next month we should have
15,01     all three back in action to once again complete the blade power force. <g>

15,01  00315] With 00Soul Seeker15's absence, so went 00Ravenhill15, the former Blade USHQ..
15,01     This void has been nicely filled by 00Despair 215, the new Blade USHQ.

15,01  00415] 00Physical Solution 15has gone on vacation for the end of this month till
15,01     the end of august, and so went The Dark Side, the Blade Courier HQ.
15,01     If you don't see a courier on yer board this month, we're sorry, shit
15,01     happens.. Call Eternal Insanity @ 908.224.8780, the pak is available for
15,01     download through the matrix.

15,01  00615] Last, but most certainly not least... Blade now has an official support
15,01     network. Speed Network was devised and setup by me <mc> in about 2 days
15,01     and is now fully active. As of right now, it is required by all HQ
15,01     boards, offered to all distros, and available though INVITE ONLY.
15,01     If you are a blade affiliated board, feel free to ask to carry the net.
15,01     If you are not blade affiliated, don't ask.. We'll come to you if we want
15,01     you. The WHQ for speed is of course Eternal Insanity @ 908.224.8780 <g>

15,01  00715] And so wraps up another month of hard work by the blade crew.. Enjoy
15,01     the pak and look for upcoming articles about Blade in many major e-mags.
