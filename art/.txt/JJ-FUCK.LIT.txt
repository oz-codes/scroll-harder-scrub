15,01fuck.
15,01who I am is being put into light...
15,01I'm scared.. really scared.
15,01I like extremes.
15,01thing is..
15,01at school I'm being put through a machine
15,01and it's changing me.
15,01it's making me want to abandon any sense of ethics. aesthetics.
15,01in the mad dash for 'success'
15,01'success' being measured in dollars.
15,01it's infected me.. my way of thinking.
15,01I dropped lsd today and it brought up new things in me
15,01that I really didn't like.
15,01for one thing I dream of having AHoM making it big.
15,01hundreds of regular users.
15,01but is that what I really want ?
15,01what happens if it becomes something big..
15,01won't I be tempted to try to make a buck of it ?
15,01what motivates me for anything ?
15,01fame. i guess. that's a hardcore
15,01desire.
15,01I want to be luxurious in the extreme
15,01without hurting anyone on my way up.
15,01sorry.
15,01no can do.
15,01decisions.

15,01fuck.
15,01all this 'machine' stuff
15,01that I'm so preachy about...
15,01it *must* be destructive of so many things before it gets anywhere.
15,01we're so fucked.

15,01I'm almost in tears.
15,01school is cool.. but
15,01extremes man.
15,01extremes.

15,01I think that'll kill me.
15,01seriously. to make anything big, huge, worthwhile
15,01you have to 'succeed'.. ahhhhh.
15,01in current times
15,01it's not reasonable to dream.
15,01you're sacrificing your mental resources when you could be thinking of ways to
15,01feed your family..

15,01fuck.
15,01fuck.
15,01fuck.

15,01there are many knots inside me.
