15,01Murdered Death

15,01if you were pummeled sound
15,01would you hear a single sound
15,01if you were a drunken mound
15,01do you think you'd have drowned

15,01you walked so stiff yet down the gate
15,01fallen drift away so late
15,01you know you're gone flow through the gate
15,01just the course of motherless fate

15,01tipped over slowly down
15,01fed up of this lifeless town
15,01only escape is under her gown
15,01take a hit you'll get shown

15,01over at the party i once knew
15,01a friend of mine he was new
15,01picked a fight with 'ol six foot two
15,01next he said he gonna sue

15,01left or right i see nothing good
15,01once or twice maybe more misunderstood
15,01can't quite dream don't do no good
15,01so i drift into my phantasmal wood

15,01protected around kept quiet within
15,01nothing here not life nor sin
15,01i hold victory so you can win
15,01or die as a mouse from my cousins pin

15,01held from laughter by the rain
15,01trapped inside my own domain
15,01i can't help wonder about this pain
15,01or if everyone else is quite as sane

15,01maybe it's me maybe it's not
15,01could be you with this kind of brain rot
15,01inside your head tingles the pot
15,01but you had to throw in your lot

15,01lost without money on the side street
15,01one or two buds i happened to meet
15,01they were wired not fit for sleep
15,01their minds weren't there for keep

15,01wandered around for endless peace
15,01but never found a jawless piece
15,01no laughter resounds from my place
15,01my endless life of discreet grace

15,01you could join me if you knew how
15,01find me in my crazed town now
15,01horrified from what i've saw
15,01or just crazed like a rabid cow
