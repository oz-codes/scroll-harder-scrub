15,01a tragic song

15,01we're killing our own kin
15,01for the color of their skin
15,01racial tension grows
15,01as hatred overflows
15,01by God our time's arrived
15,01'till now our race has thrived
15,01yet we shall kill each other
15,01as brother against brother
15,01our doom, the prophets sing
15,01of what that doom shall bring
15,01they chant their tragic song
15,01and mourn, for a world gone wrong..
