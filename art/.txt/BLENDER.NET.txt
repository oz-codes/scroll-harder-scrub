15,01hi, warpus here.

15,01i was updating the blender support site list when a cool idea popped into my
15,01head.  why not start a net to connect all the sponsor boards?  that is EXACTLY
15,01what the main purpose of blenderNET is, but it is not the only reason that
15,01it's here.  while blenderNET will be obviously dedicated to the blender, it
15,01will not be limited to it.

15,01the person running this net will most certainly not be me, as i have no time
15,01(or experiece:) to pull it off.  who will it be then?  stereo.  he has ran a
15,01net before, and after it died he really wanted to run another one.  well, here
15,01it his chance.

15,01if your board is a blender sponsor/distro site, you MUST get this net.  email
15,01stereo if you are in this situation, and he will get you hooked up asap.  if
15,01you for some reason can't, or don't want to be hooked up, and do run a distro
15,01site, email me and we will work things out.

15,01if your board ISN'T a distro site, and you want the net, apply as a distro site
15,01first.  yes, that means you have to email me :).


15,01WON'T IT BE A LITTLE EXPENSIVE TO POLL ONTARIO?!?!

15,01yes it would be.  but not if we do it through email.  there are many great
15,01programs that can send mail via a pop3 account. the one i like to use it called
15,01fido2internet.  (this is stereo speaking now btw)

15,01email me if you need more info on fido2internet.  if you run a blender sponsor
15,01site i will need you to email the following information to me: 1) board name
15,012) the main phone number  3) your location, and  4) your name.
