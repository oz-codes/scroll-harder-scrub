15,01Microsoft Windows 95 Stuns World

15,01Redmond, Wash (AP) - Fans and detractors of the long-awaited Microsoft
15,01Windows 95 have been stunned and amazed by the incredible events
15,01surrounding the August 24 release. Windows 95 has been hailed by industry
15,01giant Pierson Holcombe Pewter as "the most advanced operating system ever
15,01produced."  But even he could not have predicted yesterday's events.

15,01It began when peace was declared in Bosnia.  Said Ahmad G'Hui,
15,01spokesperson for the Serbs, "Now that [Windows 95] has been released, we
15,01just don't see any reason to fight each other.  This is an amazing
15,01product."

15,01Then France announced its intention to stop all testing of nuclear
15,01weapons. "We used to think that our national boundaries were of utmost
15,01import.  To safeguard them, it was necessary to continue testing
15,01[nuclear weapons]," said Jacques Fenetre of the French government.
15,01"The Microsoft Network (tm) has changed all of that.  It's such a small
15,01planet!"

15,01On the other side of the "small planet", George Bush and Saddam Hussein
15,01met face-to-face for the first time.  After a tense greeting, they
15,01started sharing notes about their experiences as Windows 95 beta-testers.
15,01Soon the two lifelong enemies were laughing and chatting like old friends.
15,01In a startling display of candor, Hussein said "If I hadn't been so
15,01frustrated with the beta, I'd have backed off from Kuwait much sooner."
15,01Bush laughed and commiserated with Hussein, saying "Well, Saddam, I
15,01*told* you it'd be released eventually, all you had to do was wait.
15,01Hey!  Let's play some FreeCell!"

15,01Oil prices dropped as OPEC transferred their accounting software to the
15,01new platform.  Loggers in the United States' Pacific Northwest turned
15,01their axes in for spades after seeing a Microsoft Video of spotted owls
15,01using Windows 95.  In an economic shocker, the Peso reversed its
15,01downward spiral due to huge Windows 95 sales in Acapulco and Mexico
15,01City.

15,01On the health front, Hildegard Wicca, a housewife in Boston, MA, reports
15,01that Windows 95 has removed her facial warts.  "I sat down in front of
15,01the computer, pressed 'Start', and felt something odd on my face.  When
15,01I looked in a mirror, my warts were gone!"  Even more amazing is the
15,01story of Mark Cense, the Los Alamos man who was reported last week as
15,01having an incurable, fatal form of cancer.  His doctors were amazed
15,01yesterday when, after simply buying Windows 95 at the local Computer
15,01Universe store, his cancer went into remission.

15,01When asked for a comment on these almost miraculous events, Microsoft's
15,01Bill Gates, recently declared to be the richest man in the United States,
15,01replied "If you think *this* is good, just wait until you see Windows
15,0197!"

15,01Reports that China's release of dissident Harry Wu was contingent on his
15,01returning with "as many copies of Windows 95 as he can carry" are
15,01unconfirmed at this time.
