15,01You're my violent girl
15,01So, scream and bitch and hurl
15,01I can't care for what I'm worth
15,01Like a wonderland wizard and witch I'm in a curse

15,01Dogs and cats run wild
15,01The sauce of your blood is less than mild
15,01I've got a little thing, helps me see
15,01Helps me feel, so we're blind and real

15,01Unending in my complaining, neverending
15,01Mystery of the maze we're pretending
15,01Don't know why, but we can cry
15,01Jump from your balcony and we can't fly

15,01See you live and see you die
15,01I'd never want more than to see you cry
15,01Leave me now, love me do
15,01Scatter little rodents and I will too

15,01Do you clench your fists and draw your blood
15,01Wipe red on your face to blur your sight, just

15,01See you live and see you die
15,01I'd never want more than to see your cries

15,01Alone and in the dark
15,01Like an insane psycho in a forest park
15,01You're just waiting for a moment to strike
15,01One, two, three, you're out, better off a dyke

15,01You're touched so much you're in pain
15,01That's your soul that's dirty and slain
15,01Take your baby, cradle, infant and milk
15,01Wrap me butterfly in a blanket of silk

15,01See you live and see you die
15,01Die die die.. 
15,01I'd never want more than to see you cry
15,01Cry cry cry..

15,01Wantonly jealous my friend
15,01Pay the price to the end
