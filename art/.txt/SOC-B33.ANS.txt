02,01        It was one of those "lazy summer days" everyone talks about when
02,01they get older but never appriciate when they were young.  On that day I
02,01was not appriciating the scorching heat that seemed to stick to the walls
02,01of the two-story victorian house I had lived in all my life.  I had a nice
02,01view of the backyard from my bedroom window, and the backyard ended where
02,01the woods began. I was twelve years old.
02,01        Looking back on it now, being twelve was one of the worst ages I've
02,01ever been.  It was if half the world expected be to be a teenage hooligan
02,01and the other half expected me to still like playing with lincoln logs. I
02,01expected neither of myself.
02,01        It was that year that everything seemed to fall in on itself, when
02,01my friend Pope and I decided to try and build a fort in the back of the
02,01woods.  Everybody called him Pope because his head was shaped like that
02,01funny hat the Pope wears.  That and I think that Pope was his last name.
02,01But it didnt' really matter that much.
02,01        We'd picked a pretty good spot for the fort, too.  It was more like
02,01a treehouse than anything else.  We found this great spread out tree that
02,01had all sorts of different branches that were close to each other.  Not like
02,01an oak tree where you're lucky if you can even climb the thing.  We nailed
02,01cut up pieces of 2X4 to the trunk of it as steps, so we could climb up
02,01further.  They were pretty sturdy, too.
02,01        So it went like that for about a week, me sitting in the tree with
02,01a hammer and Pope handing up the wood we had scavanged from around the
02,01neighborhood.  We almost ran out of nails, until one day when we were poking
02,01around a construction site, we found an old box of carpernters nails that
02,01had been partially buried under the dirt.
02,01        Once we got the treehouse built, things went pretty good. It was
02,01sort of spread out over five branches.  More like little platforms than
02,01an actual treehouse. But it didn't matter, cause Pope and I would go there
02,01every day after lunch and just sort of hang out.  Sometimes we'd bring books
02,01and just read, and occasionally a cool breeze would come by and that would
02,01make the day even better. Then we decided to dam up the creek that ran
02,01by the treehouse.
02,01        We were thinking about how great it would be to go to the pool that
02,01afternoon because it was so hot.  We'd have to ride our bikes though, and
02,01we were just too tired to bother.  So we decided to try and dam up the
02,01creek instead. (Of course that would be a lot more work than riding our
02,01bikes to the pool, but that didn't seem to matter at the time.)
02,01        We started to gather rocks from around the creekbed, and we just
02,01started trying to build a wall from one bank to the other. It was hard work,
02,01but the shade from the trees at the side of the creek helped, and we waded
02,01around the creek in the cool water.
02,01        After about two hours of stacking the rocks up, we finally managed
02,01to get a wall about two feet high.  The water started to back up behind it,
02,01starting to form a little pool. After dunking our heads in the water, we
02,01went home for dinner.
02,01        The next day we went back and stacked rocks until the wall was four
02,01feet high, but it didn't seem to matter because the water leaked through
02,01the cracks. So we started shoveling dirt with some scraps of wood from
02,01the treehouse and piling it behind the damn.  That seemed to do the trick,
02,01and the water seemed to be just a trickle.
02,01        So for weeks afterwards we would go to the treehouse and swim in
02,01the pond when we got too hot.  It was sort of deep enough to swim in, but
02,01most of the time we just sat there enjoying the patterns the light made
02,01through the leaves on the trees and trying not to think about school.
02,01        Then Pope got the great idea one day to try and dive from the
02,01treehouse.  He did a cannonball and made the biggest splash I'd ever seen,
02,01and it almost started to crack the dam.
02,01        He tried another, this time a normal head-first dive, and when
02,01I saw him start to do it a scream sort of froze in the back of my throat,
02,01as if I thought I could stop time. Or history, for that matter.
02,01        Everything seemed to go in slow motion as he dived with his arms
