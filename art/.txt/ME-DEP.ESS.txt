15,01Essay 1:
15,01Depression unto Death

15,01        Death is the sower of dreams. Nothing comes closer to the razor
15,01blade than sleep. In the words of Schopenhaur, "The only difference between
15,01sleep and reality is the waking experience." What could be more true.
15,01Life is a nightmare overshadowed between moments of happiness and suffering.
15,01Sleeping is dying for the eight hours I lay my head.

15,01        I know happiness. I feel happiness when I am with my friends, when
15,01I can predict the events of the next day, or at least have some notion that
15,01the next day will be as good as the first. Any person used to depression
15,01will admit that it comes when happiness is shattered in the sake
15,01of pain and suffering. This pain and suffering leaves the victim (of
15,01society's greater ills) little left to cling onto. Depression leaves the
15,01victim in a state discontent, and in extreme cases suicide can result.

15,01        I am not a psycolgist, nor am I fluent the greater arts of treating
15,01mental illness, but I, like many others, am a suffer of depression.
15,01Depression comes quick and leaves just as it came. I have seen the results
15,01of depression, I have felt it's cold touch. I have witnessed it's morbid
15,01hours, the tolls it leaves upon the body and soul. When one is depressed
15,01the digestive system suffers, usually through lack of nutrition, and so
15,01does a person's whole being. Depression brings little life, but instead
15,01bears the fetus of death (in all her black guises). 

15,01        Since everyone I have ever met has felt depression at least one
15,01point in his or her life, I will move onto the second half of my essay,
15,01the problem of death, and even more, the problem of self-inflicted
15,01death, suicide. A person not aquainted with death will not understand
15,01living, since death is the respected opposite of living, and many
15,01religions compare birth to dying. Death is as just (in a legal sense) 
15,01as the forces which granted humanity existance.

15,01        To paraphrase the words of a famous 20th century author, whose
15,01name memory fails to retrive, "Death can come in any form. Like two
15,01bicycle policemen on a Paris street." Death offers an immediate end to
15,01pain and suffering, and for religion death offers the paradise of the
15,01afterlife. Young men are taught to fear death, the elderly and injured
15,01know it's friendly face. In our Puritan heritage we have always been
15,01afraid of the unknown, and many a lesser critic has had to rise to
15,01the pillory, much like Hester Prynne, and suffer the pains for preaching
15,01their dark sermon. I tell my readers now, death is nothing to fear. It
15,01is as natural as the depression which leads up to it. Suicide is always
15,01an alternative, but in many cases is abused as the only alternative.
15,01In this light the suicidal have been disgraced by an uncaring, unsympathetic
15,01"christian" society that has never come to terms with living, nonetheless
15,01dying. If humanity was smart, it would put these religious hipocrits to
15,01shame, and save what's left of our sanity.

15,01        In conclusion, no matter how much we, as a society fear death, we
15,01can not be overwhelmed by it. It's much better to call the end a friend
15,01than an enemy. It goes without saying, I will be accused of influencing 
15,01people to view death in new ways, but let it stand, I do not believe
15,01in unnecessary suicide. I pray that mankind can come to terms with his
15,01mortality, and thus understand the principles of living. There is no better
15,01time than this. We will never get a second chance. One should live life
15,01as he wants to, not as he is told to do. We are but a moment in time.
15,01To ask for any form of immortality is too much, for even the great
15,01men of our age will eventually lose face to the dark mortician. Enjoy 
15,01what seconds in history mankind has left; you too will certainly 
15,01fade away.
