15,01I woke this morning to the wonderful ring of the telee. After
15,01dressing in my kahkis and extra-sized Nike shirt, I wistfully left my
15,01room and entered the kitchen.
15,01"<Sniff, Sniff> Oh.."

15,01I returned quickly to my room and de-dressed, and gave a quick 
15,01passing glance at the clock while grabbing a towel on my way to the
15,01shower. hmm, 7:10.
15,01For some reason, most likely due to the lack of sleep I had and
15,01the earliness in the day, that time didn't quite click in my head until
15,01I was nice and settled in the warm cloak of water..

15,01.

15,01uhm.

15,01...

15,01hmm.

15,01......

15,01wait.              04GAH15!?!@$%&*@ 7:10!@$&^%*

15,01Employing my skills of elitist Black0ps training, I ducked,
15,01dove, and rolled out of the shower, through my towel, into my clothes,
15,01into the straps of my schoolbag, until finally finishing with a double
15,01somersault with a half-twist (while snatching from my step-mother's
15,01hand a toaster streudal, hah!).
15,01I hopped down the short flight of stairs and checked myself
15,01over with the quickness.... The droning crank of the bus loomed omin-
15,01ously down the street, and so I jumped, opening the door and beginn-
15,01ing a jog down to the corner.
15,01My jog slowed to a walk and then to nigh-on movement (other
15,01than my jaw, which fell swiftly to the ground) as the busdriver closed
15,01the door to the big yellow turd which pulled off, away from the corner,
15,01MY corner, only feet in front of me.

15,01grrrrrrrrrr.....

15,01Having already exhausted my elitist training, I had no way of
15,01reaching the bus. Also, now that my parental units had already-exited,
15,01I was without an alternate course of action --so I stayed home.
