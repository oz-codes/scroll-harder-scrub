15,01..# Predatory Nature #..



15,01Feel the fear beat in your veins;
15,01Suck the blood to ease the pain,
15,01But you can't escape - can never hide;
15,01Deep inside, you're terrified.

15,01Once you were full of pride and might,
15,01But the halocaust turned Eden to blight.
15,01Now the world is a darkened hell;
15,01Stench of the land makes your stomach swell.

15,01Mutant you are, with savage lusts;
15,01No more passion; no more trust.
15,01You roam like the hunted, fleeing the cage
15,01While the force in your veins builds with a rage.

15,01Now you're backed in a corner, a midnight alley -
15,01No friends to turn to; no troops to rally.
15,01You're trapped like a rat and can't move an inch;
15,01Knife to your throat makes your fists clench

15,01Now you are fighting; strike with your heart.
15,01Know if you fail that he'll tear you apart,
15,01But you know you won't fail, because deep in your soul
15,01Your Predatory Nature has taken total control.
