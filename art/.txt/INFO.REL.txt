15,01        What?!? The Relic pack is LATE?!?!? What the hell happened?!?

15,01       Yup, as you can see, we were very late this month. There is one
15,01      main reason for this, and thats our standard release date. Due to
15,01      the fact that we normally release on the 20th, which in the month
15,01      of december lands us REALLY close to x-mas, VERY few of the
15,01      members were home when it came time for me to collect the month
15,01      pack stuff and get all this shit together. As of our regular pack
15,01      day, i had about 15 ansis all of which were by eerie, zipper head,
15,01      plus 1 by shinobi. i REALLY didn't want to release a pack with
15,01      only that, so i decided to put it off for a few days. Well, after
15,01      a few days, i had a few more from eerie, and b00mer had thrown in
15,01      some stuff.... but i still felt it was lacking a lot from being a
15,01      worth while pack. Things were like that for a few more days, and
15,01      myself and shinobi <the only member i could contact with any
15,01      degree of regularity> had pretty much decided to skip the month of
15,01      december and just have a really huge killer pack in january. But
15,01      one big letter from eerie and a few hours on the phone changed
15,01      that. And heres your pack. Ten days late, but it's here.

15,01       And in other news:

15,01      Flood has been restricted from his computer all month, thus the
15,01      lack of work from him. In another week or two he'll get it back,
15,01      so we should have 1 or 2 ansis from him in the next pack.

15,01      Sniper has decided to quit the scene. We wish him luck in his
15,01      future endevors and will gladly accept him back should he ever
15,01      decide to return to the fold.


15,01     Well, i'm sure theres about 20 other things i need to say, but it's
15,01     3am, this thing is 10 days late already, and i still have dishes to
15,01     do. So stay tuned for our blowout first ANNIVERSARY pack next
15,01     month! <Get on the ball guys, only 20 days left!>

15,01                        See ya in 20 same bat-time same bat-channel,
