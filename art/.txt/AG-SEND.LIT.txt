15,01  I was listening to my shauna rolston cd and wrote this (i sound a helluva 
15,01lot more important than i should):


15,01  the kitchen,
15,01  where body juices spilt
15,01  over the counter,
15,01  eating without hunger tasted
15,01  sweet as one plum
15,01  in a basket of plums

15,01  Romans you called us
15,01  in those days
15,01  the front door open, swallowing a breeze
15,01  pits and outdoor smells
15,01  growing in our noses,
15,01  weeds strangling the scent
15,01  of each other's necks

15,01  hundreds floating in the sink,
15,01  tatooed with rainbows,
15,01  slit with a sticky knife;
15,01  wash the dishes,
15,01  trade revery for rags.
