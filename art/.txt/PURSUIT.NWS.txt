00,01Here we are, on the third pack.  Unfortunately, it is the smallest of the
00,01three.  Damn finals.  Anyhow, now that summer is here, you can be sure to see
00,01mass quantities of Pursuit ansi's coming up.  Though quantity went down this
00,01month, quality definitely went up, and that's what really counts.
00,01P.S. I promise to have work in the next pack.  No, REALLY!!!

15,01Welp, another short month gone by, and likewise, another awesome Pursuit
15,01Pack released.  This month, there was a slow down of quantity, but a great
15,01improvement in quality.  Every Pursuit artist has increased their quality
15,01of work this month, and we'd like to give them all a great big, gigantic,
15,01huge, outstanding pat on the back.  The slowdown of quantity was mainly
15,01due to finals at school, and other shit that took place.  (Woopsee, I let
15,01loose a bad word.  Sorry mom).

15,01A special note goes out to Argon, who has, in my opinion, GREATLY increased
15,01his work this month.  He figured out (all by himself I might add), that by
15,01taking his time, his quality WOULD improve =) .  As always, outstanding work
15,01has come from Mr. Ash, Mr. Gnome, and Mr. Psyber.  Oh, and gee, also from
15,01our innnnnnnnnncredible president - The Carnage, who always produces good
15,01work, so we don't need to compliment him! =)

15,01And yes, their is a Pursuit viewer coming out.  It's just that our coders
15,01like to take there very important time, in all there jobs, so that they can
15,01produce the best coding possible - for all our fans to enjoy =).  So bare
15,01with the Pursuit Crew, we won't let you down.

15,01Now, I would personally like to give a warm welcome to the new members to
15,01Pursuit: Suicidal Tendencies, and Flaming Rasmussen, who are 2 very
15,01outstanding couriers.  Also, we'd like to grieve the loss of Liquidator,
15,01who was one of the best couriers we've had, and ever will have.

15,01In short, =) Pursuit would like to thank ya for reading this shit, and taking
15,01the time to type out all our ansi's... Haha!  N-E-Ways, Pursuit is growing
15,01every month, so stick with us.  Later
