15,01    It was such a strange feeling, this girl I'd known for years, and in all
15,01that time, discounting hellos and goodbyes, we couldn't have exchanged more
15,01than two dozen words.

15,01    And now, here we were, lying next to one another, watching the stars age.
15,01It was a cloudless autumn night.  Should have been cold, but it wasn't.  No
15,01sound but the occasional tickle of a breeze through the grass, and our two
15,01voices.

15,01    I couldn't remember how we got here.  Time was lost, and now was endless.
15,01Any other two people on Earth might have been bored just lying there, beside
15,01one another, with nothing to do, but not us.

15,01    We talked about the sky and the latest fashions.  About the city and about
15,01love.

15,01    There was a few moments of silence, after which she asked me how people
15,01could be so cruel.

15,01    Cruel?  I asked.  I asked her if she had anything specific in mind.

15,01    She said no, nothing specific, she just wanted to know why human nature
15,01will allow someone to be so hurtful.

15,01    Well, I said, have you ever hurt someone?

15,01    And she said yeah, she guessed she did, but it was only because she'd been
15,01hurt, and she lashed out.

15,01    Well, I said, do you think maybe you've ever hurt someone without even
15,01knowing it?  And maybe they were too polite or too self-conscious to tell you?

15,01    She thought about that for a second, then admitted yeah, she probably had.

15,01    Well, I said, that's how the world works.  People get hurt, and they hurt
15,01in kind.  This cycle just keeps going and never stops, because no one has the
15,01courage to repay someone who's hurt them with love.

15,01    She turned to me and asked if I had the courage.

15,01    No, not always, I admitted.  Sometimes the knife sinks in so deep you just
15,01can't pull it out.  But I told her that I try.

15,01    She nodded as though she believed me.

15,01    I think it's true.  At least I try.  So I asked her if she'd stop hurting
15,01people to try to break the chain.

15,01    She thought about this for a long time.  So long that I thought she wasn't
15,01going to answer.  Finally, she said she'd probably at least think about it next
15,01time she felt like hurting someone, and ask herself if it was worth it.

15,01    I smiled.  I didn't know if I believed her or not, but it was nice to hear
15,01her say it.

15,01    So we both turned our gazes back to the sky and watched the stars age some
15,01more.

15,01    I have rarely seen her since, and discounting hellos and goodbyes, I don't
15,01think we've said two dozen words to each other.

15,01    But, we're different.  There is a unique bond between us.  A tiny,
15,01invisible yet unbreakable thread of love and hope.

15,01    And one day, perhaps, after many nights in many fields with many people,
15,01we'll weave a web which we'll throw over the whole world, and suffocate all the
15,01hate and anger.
