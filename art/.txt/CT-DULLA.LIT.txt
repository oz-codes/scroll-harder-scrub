15,01Make me shallow, make me dull as lead
15,01and help me be the simplest alive.
15,01Remove the hornets from their living hive
15,01and gently loose all thoughts from in my head.

15,01Uneducate me - all I have is this:
15,01the only chance to capture fleeting peace
15,01is make awareness of the problems cease.
15,01In ignorance alone can I find bliss.

15,01Be still, my roving eyes.  Then I will not
15,01have seen that which upset me.  I'll forget
15,01unpleasantries  and tragedy in thought.

15,01These words alone will stand to speak my debt
15,01and loss.  My blank, uncomprehending stares
15,01will never once betray forgotten cares.
