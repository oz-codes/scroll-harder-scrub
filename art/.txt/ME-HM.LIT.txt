15,01                        Robed, black clad figures,
15,01                              Twenty in all,
15,01                     Up to the mountain are climbing,
15,01                         Bring the end of Fall-

15,01                          November's fires burning,
15,01                    Entombed spirits attracted to light,
15,01                         All Hollow's Moon is rising,
15,01                    The sacred daggers are ready tonight-

15,01                 On a slab of stone runs the virgin's blood,
15,01               Ancient gods lapping it up in the shape of dogs,
15,01               Out of the long undisturbed tombs spirits flood,
15,01                To the night sky, covering the heavens above-

15,01                        Yet in the world of mortals,
15,01              We watched the on coming storm with intrepid fear,
15,01                     Every door bolted at every portal,
15,01                    My wife and I shivering by the fire,
15,01                     The children, wide awake in tears,
15,01                 Listening to sounds only children can hear-

15,01                           As I laid awake waiting,
15,01                      And dreaming in perpetual thought,
15,01                        Light dwindling to the door...
15,01               By the spirits I heard an ear shattering whine,
15,01                      A chill ran down the floor boards,
15,01                              And up my spine-

15,01                           Running to the windows,
15,01                     Throwing open the shutters to see...
15,01                   A manlike beast passing through the sky,
15,01                            Out to a chaotic sea-

15,01                   A mountain of fire burning to the night,
15,01              Oh, what evil in man could ask for this twilight's
15,01                                 sacred boon,
15,01               If there was a God what has become of him now,
15,01                   In the quickening of the Harvest Moon-


15,01                                                 Mister E. 04[CiA]
