15,01                               death's fowl ride

15,01                    Disorderly! Like a rich-man and his woe
15,01                  Masked riders thronged with capes they came
15,01                      And trampled when the night lied low
15,01                       To light the fire's hottest flame!
15,01                        Through our fair lands treachery
15,01                        And their pride's encumbered sin
15,01                    where none were there, they sought to be
15,01                            what none had ever been!

15,01                   Despondancy! Like a peasant and his grief
15,01                      Oppression's fist bode warning then
15,01                     When quarrels lifted sword from sheath
15,01                          And killed the best of men!
15,01                       here and there, the riders 'round
15,01                       chanted songs that none could hear
15,01                           of their legends, unabound
15,01                               drawing ever near!

15,01                 Transparency! Like a cold wind from the north
15,01                      through light's tranquility we arise
15,01                   faced with visage of death, we bring forth
15,01                           to betray those very eyes!
15,01                      the raiders, come to reap their crop
15,01                     will turn from their so gruesome path
15,01                        and all their tyranny will stop
15,01                          fleeing from it's aftermath!
