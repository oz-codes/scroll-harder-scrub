15,01Rejection: The Entrance to Hell
15,01By The Warden [FLiP]

15,01Time has gone and days have passed
15,01It has finally come to this
15,01The friend I so dearly care about
15,01And love

15,01Has left me and wishes to have nothing to do with me

15,01Now I'm all alone
15,01In this hell hole of a world

15,01Death comes closer to me
15,01And as I start excepting
15,01My worthless life

15,01Thoughts of suicide pass through
15,01Which thought I will chose to kill myself
15,01Only the one who finds me will know

15,01So long
15,01And goodbye
