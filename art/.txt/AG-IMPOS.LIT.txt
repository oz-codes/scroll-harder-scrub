15,01 Without money (a safety precaution), I put myself in the position of
15,01seriously considering buying pornographic materials (after Stan's lecture, 
15,01which was anything but disuading the use of porn)... I hate spending 
15,01my unearned money on transient items, like exorbitant ($1.90) grilled cheese.
15,01(though, in a daze, I might give in one day to "erotica": the distinction 
15,01being, for me, the material does not depict sex. the grilled cheese has caught
15,01me many times already)


15,01porno magazine
15,01thrilling how it peeks out
15,01like a leg
15,01from a white dress;
15,01the white shelf
15,01was once too high

15,01now I'm tall enough to see
15,01down the cover.
15,01could this rot my brain?
15,01a virus? transform me into a grunt?
15,01but where's the Moral General's Warning stamp?
15,01why are the men beside me
15,01hiding inside hoods, behind sunglasses?
15,01are their eyes sore from the glossy glare?

15,01ah, only poses, dead poses.
15,01compendium of corpses.
15,01necrology with colour pictures;
15,01the image lives on paper
15,01no smell or sound
15,01deceased, paralyzed on display
15,01entombed in a photo flash.
