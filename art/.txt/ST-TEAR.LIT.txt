15,01I Caught A Tear

15,01I caught a tear.
15,01It rolled from my eye
15,01Down my face to my chin, 
15,01And I stared simply
15,01amazed.

15,01Amazed at the beauty,
15,01The splendor of emotion,
15,01The bright colors that the
15,01tear embraced,
15,01The virtue of innocence.
15,01Innocence that cleansed my
15,01soul,
15,01That made me think,
15,01Is my heart a stone
15,01Or do I like to be alone?

15,01Alone with no emotion
15,01No fears to burden me
15,01But that tear reminds me
15,01That love is not cheap.

15,01Oh, how I stared
15,01And soon I was lost,
15,01God can you tell me
15,01How much does one teardrop cost?
