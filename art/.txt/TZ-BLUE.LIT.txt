15,01Blue Bang!

15,01When I was a child,
15,01I skipped stones across the lake.
15,01They jumped and skidding, ended with a plop,
15,01somewhere in the vast blue abyss.

15,01The stones grew in size,
15,01Going from plop to plunk,
15,01From flip to flop,
15,01From splish to splash.

15,01I have a bomb now.
15,01How many fish can hear it's bang?
