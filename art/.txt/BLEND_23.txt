15,01Math Romance

15,01They integrated from the very point of origin.  Her curves were
15,01continuous, and even though he was odd, he was a real number.
15,01The day their lines first intersected, they became an ordered pair.
15,01From then on it was a continuous function.  They were both in their prime,
15,01so in next to no time they were horizontal and parallel.  She was awed by
15,01the magnitude of his perpendicular line, and he was amazed by her conical
15,01projections.  "Bisect my angle!" she postulated each time she reached her
15,01local maximum.  He taught her the chain rule as she implicitly defined the
15,01amplitude of his simple harmonic motion.  They underwent multiple rotations
15,01of their axes, until at last they reached the vertex, the critical point,
15,01their finite limit.  After that they slept like logs.

15,01Later she found him taking a right-handed limit, that was a
15,01problem, it was improper form.  He meanwhile had realized that she was
15,01irrational, not to mention square.  They diverged.
