15,01Under the Forge of Night

15,01In the land of mortals...
15,01Before we all cross into the barren fields
15,01  of sleep,
15,01Within the starlight terraces of the
15,01  nightmakers,
15,01Under the artifical dome of consciousness-

15,01Oh what creators of fate and happiness,
15,01Have clouded our days in the light
15,01   of dismal emotions,
15,01Under the forge of night-

15,01Coffee and surgary time,
15,01Have permeated through...
15,01Our only companions on the train out
15,01  of our minds,
15,01Everything victimized...
15,01Under...-

15,01There is a leason to be learned,
15,01In all of this...
15,01        Open yourself,
15,01        Open what's left of your mind,
15,01Create...
15,01        Uncreate...
15,01Reform the universe,
15,01A new Jerusalem will open
15,01To those who are free...
15,01Under the cracked dome,
15,01Under the night-


15,01                        Mister E. [CiA]
