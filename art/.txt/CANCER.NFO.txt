15,01   Greetings and welcome once again to another fine CNC presentation. 
15,01Before I begin I would like to make a quick apology all all our Dist sites...
15,01"Sorry guys about the constant Delays but I had allot of serious personal as  
15,01well as internal problems"...but that now is all fixed so there will be no 
15,01further delays of any kind. (At least I pray)...

15,01Anyhow I hope you enjoy this month's presentation. It is quite good 
15,01considering the small amount of members that CANCER now posesses.  At least 
15,01that is my opinion. I will let u judge for yourselves. We're down to something
15,01like 10 full ansi artists, 4 vga artists, 3 musicians and 3 coders. All
15,01the dead weight has been dropped, and I am glad that this has occured.
15,01We also dropped the lit dept and we're not accepting any lit artists unless 
15,01they show considerable skill...(so the possibility still remains, however
15,01it is unlikely). Quite a bit of talent is still awaiting acceptence so 
15,01we will most likely double in size shortly. We are still far from what groups
15,01like ACiD, iCE, and UNiON have in terms of mmbers, yet we plan to produce 
15,01quality, ORIGINAL artwork for the masses. Remember its quality not quantity!

15,01   In case you are not familiar with CANCER I'll take a moment to explain...
15,01 " the group". If u know some of our policies u can skip this part. CANCER
15,01 is yet another "ART" group like so many before yet we are somewhat different.
15,01 The Key term when discussing CANCER is "ART" Not "REPLICA"...U will never
15,01 see a CANCER ansi from an IMAGE comic, or any other comic for that matter.
15,01 We release ART Portfolios, not comic books which groups like UNiON (tm) seem 
15,01 to produce. WE strive for ORIGINALITY, and we absolutely don't do SPAWN (tm), 
15,01 WILDCATS (tm), CYBERFORE(tm), ar anything from any other cheesy comic book. 
15,01 Personally I do not enjoy seeing the same picture in ANSI format that I have 
15,01 previously seen in the comic book store, or 10 different versions of the same 
15,01 comic character. It gets old, and it is all fake...monkey see monkey do.. 
15,01 Therefore CANCER artists are real artists not people who can forge Jim Lee's 
15,01 comics to perfection. I know that I'm probably pissing into someone's pond 
15,01 but that is how I feel about what is happening in the scene. So each month  
15,01 u the viewers can open a doorway into a fresh new reality. U will actually
15,01 see work that has never been done before...WHoa there's a first...
15,01    Secondly CANCER does not deal with the bullshit politics that seem to 
15,01encircle each major art group. For instance I'm not going to sit around 
15,01and tell u who joined this month, who quit and who changed his/her handle, 
15,01and who pissed on whose's dog. I don't think that internal affairs is what u
15,01want to read about. We also don't do the petty squabbles that seem to be going 
15,01off and on...I don't care who is the best group, and who has better coders etc,
15,01I just care about sharing my artwork, and pleasing the audience with the 
15,01results of my effort...the Cancer monthly pack.
15,01   Third due to the fact that we produce ORIGINAL work (yes that would be the 
15,01the stuff from your own head...) we avoid most of the crap that many groups 
15,01have to put up with. Like the incident with that loozer from UNiON (tm)
15,01who copied that iCE (tm) ansi and then had to go on and explain that he 
15,01didn't..preaty pathetic eh?..I shit u not...(he even went as far as to scan
15,01the original comic). In CANCER that would never happen for comic books are
15,01not allowed. CANCER work takes talent..ITS all hard work. I don't feel sorry 
15,01for idiots like that, because if they did something original for a change 
15,01they wouldn't have to put up with shit like that. (Sorry that I'm kinda going
15,01off an a tangent but I had to get that out). And we don't pull shit like  
15,01MIIS does...U will never see a CANCER member rip anything and if he does
15,01and I have missed it and it ended up in the pack..and later I learn about it,
15,01He IS HISTORY..No apoligoes, no speeches, no bullshit...just GONE!
15,01   Fourth CANCER has an open ended design..Members can do what they please,
15,01and they can switch fields. For example ansi artists can do music, or vga or 
15,01code or whatever. This allows each person to explore his/her many potentials,
15,01and makes the work a little less boring.  
15,01    Lastly CANCER is foremost an ART group dedicated to producing quality
15,01ORIGINAL work. We're just a bunch of guys and gals who like to show the 
15,01world what they can accomplish,  a bunch of furry little friends who wanna 
15,01reach out and touch someone.  We're demolishing the competition, and we plan 
15,01to stay at the top.  I hope I don't sound too arrogant or egoistical..that 
15,01is not my intention. If I did then I apologise. I have no desire to sound like 
15,01some stuck up asshole,...
15,01                           Thank u for your time.....

15,01                  AND NOW LETS GO ON.......

15,01   Inside the pack there is an ansi by HANZO the Fiend called HTF-CODR. 
15,01I advise that if u plan to view it in vga u use the Newest version 
15,01of ACiDVIEW (tm). The ansi is like 1300+ lines (completely original), and 
15,01around 250+k. The only program it will run on in 320x200 vga mode or higher is
15,01ACiDVIEW and only on the new one. On everything else it chokes...so we 
15,01didn't even bother to iclude our cheesy viewer. (yes its cheesy we still 
15,01lack the coders to create a masterpiece). 

15,01Welp thats about it...oh one other thing...If U are an artist, and u feel
