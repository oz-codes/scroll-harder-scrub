08,01In a14 stream of cold fire
08,01Turn14 the cross upright
08,01Reac14hing for places higher
08,01Cryi14ng to the dark sun
08,01For14 his lost control
08,01Sigh14ing with his task done
08,01In h14is master role
08,01Roam14 for miles in the raw sand
08,01Stan14d on knives of broken pains
08,01Try14 to run from the land
08,01Thro14ugh the tears in the rains
08,01Watc14hing hopes as they fly
08,01Scan14 the waves for a sign
08,01Star14ve on wrath, created to die
08,01No14 08t14hought quite pure and fine
08,01Litt14er the land with broken dreams
08,01Carc14ass falls to be scavenged
08,01Find14 souls cry out in dark beams
08,01Neve14r cared nor avenged
08,01Wand14er through the cold light
08,01Crus14hed by blackened heavy thought

08,01Only14 to be destroyed from what worry wrought
08,01Fall14 to life from sweet death
08,01Cry14 to warm dark and kind mute
08,01Let14 you pass through their breath
08,01Let14 your life in, beaten by the brute
08,01Harv14est are the dead
08,01Brea14th the deep and present terror
08,01Fill14 their gullet with her dread
08,01Othe14rs create the mirror
08,01Reac14hed for glistening stars
08,01Gras14ps emptiness, sliver of mind
08,01Held14 by his own steel bars
08,01Drop14s his sanity, leaves it behind
08,01Cowe14ring in the bright night
08,01Feel14ings for the lifelike statue
08,01Feel14s no life in sight
08,01Matt14ers little of virtue
