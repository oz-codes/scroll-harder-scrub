15,01 well this is our application generator. fill it out, send it in, and we 
15,01 will decide if your cut out to be a member of CRANiUM PRODUCTiONS.
15,01 we will decide on your application, probably over a couple of hamburgers 
15,01 from Checkers(tm), so hope that the serve us good food.

15,01 id like to thank AKiRA for takin the time to code this app gen. 
15,01 
15,01 id like to also thank all those lamer groups out there, whos shitty work
15,01 has inspired me to start CRANiUM.

15,01 well this is going to be quick. . .

15,01 i coded this thing in about an hour and a half so don't expect much from it!
15,01 ( well, it's not certainly not bad . . . in fact, i like it <grin> )

15,01 since asphyxia developments coded this sucker i think it deserves some
15,01 credit and here is the place to do it . . .

15,01 since clorox cowboy wanted me to do this for his group, i shall grant the
15,01 copyright between us . . . afterall, he did do the grafix

15,01 of course you lamers out there can go ahead and copy my work but remember
15,01 me everytime you run your app generator!!  it'll be on your conscience
15,01 forever!! :>

15,01 anyway not much to say tis too late . . .

15,01Technical Info:

15,01This entire program was coded in Pascal, aside from Chicken's HSC routines.
15,01Thanx to him for those wonderful routines, since it's extremely difficult to
15,01find HSC files much less a PLAYER!  If anyone can get ahold of these, GET
15,01AHOLD OF ME!  You can contact me on my BBS at 4o77738485
