15,01Visions,
15,01They come to me...
15,01Shifting face,
15,01Lights that never dim,
15,01The orbs of steel...-

15,01Magnificent breath over a dime,
15,01Licking stamps,
15,01Mail my dreams to the sun,
15,01People walking in and out...
15,01Telling me their tolls,
15,01Blights upon their souls...
15,01I tell them I'm sorry,
15,01What else did they expect?-

15,01With a ringing in my ears,
15,01And blood creeping up my veins,
15,01This I know...
15,01I can see.
15,01What visions we chased,
15,01Have chased us down,
15,01And now here we stand,
15,01Shaking in the cold of the morning sun,
15,01Through my eyes,
15,01And out my life...
15,01I have relearned perception-

15,01Looking out of flowers,
15,01I can hear their cries,
15,01As the fires burn across the fields,
15,01All the poppies and tulips are screaming-

15,01But here we sit...
15,01Waiting for someone to come in and rob us
15,01Of ourself...
15,01Visions through water,
15,01I can see into myself,
15,01The world is a pad of our visions,
15,01And echos through our voice-
