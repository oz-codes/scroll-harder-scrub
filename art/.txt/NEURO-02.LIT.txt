15,01 "I do not fear death,
15,01                only the moments before it." - NP



15,01And in the midst of this chaotic world
15,01my emotions on paper relent, unfurled
15,01with little words of rhythm and rhyme
15,01I make my mark on the sands of time

15,01this flowing power of love and hate
15,01can bond a person to his fate
15,01but when we free this bondage notion
15,01we lay down the rites of true emotion

15,01I am a poet. 
15,01I embody everything about me yet nothing.
15,01,everyone yet no one. 
15,01,everywhere yet nowhere.

15,01and one day soon, my poet's dream
15,01if through my eyes the world could be seen
15,01far up above would be you and I
15,01above this world, in the vastness of sky

15,01But.... if in our lives our paths's should depart
15,01emotions of love revoked by the heart
15,01Yes,I might stumble on the road, lose a foothold along the way
15,01but then will be the time to reminisce and think of a better day.

15,01And so ill bid thee all goodbye as a mourner to the grave
15,01Our lives stretch on before us,no turning back or final wave
15,01and in my age the flame creeps over my old decrepit shell
15,01As I sit back and write softly and whisper my farewells.
