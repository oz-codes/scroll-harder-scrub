15,01They Enter the place
15,01Once there before
15,01Plotting the plan

15,01Now there again
15,01Thinking
15,01Should I
15,01Or Shouldn't I

15,01Staking the place out
15,01People passing
15,01Saying "Got it yet?"
15,01Every few seconds
15,01Making the situation seem
15,01More intense then it really is
15,01Then the move is made
15,01He quickly stuffs the CD into the jacket

15,01His buddies on the side
15,01Saying "Whatcha got?"
15,01Practically blowing the whole deal
15,01Relief is coming near
15,01Just a few more steps

15,01The hand
15,01The Voice
15,01The Question
15,01"Excuse me, Do you have a CD in your jacket?"
15,01In response
15,01"No"

15,01Friends
15,01No longer known to him
15,01Are slowly
15,01Walking away
15,01Excusing themselves from the situation

15,01Now in the security room
15,01Totally embarrassed
15,01Having to call every parent
15,01Of his friends
15,01Telling them the situation
