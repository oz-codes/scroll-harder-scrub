15,01    Well here is the demo you whanted... I don't know why you whanted that
15,01    huge ANSI on the end, it increesed the files size somehere between 
15,01    10-20k (I'm not shure because of the compression) and messed up the 
15,01    compression ratio because of the TEXT and GRAPHIC data!! 

15,01    Also, why the MUSIC? it's just a scroller... this could have been 
15,01    12-14k if it didn't have the ANSI and MUSIC!!

15,01    I've included the source code to this program in SOURCE.ZIP, it can be
15,01    distributed freely -- This is nothing special, so mabey it'll help
15,01    someone... 

15,01    also, the way the source code is set up, you could make another stupid
15,01    loader with the same code and juts switching couple things, it's all
15,01    explained in READ.ME -- you can save us coders some time! heheh

15,01    hey, could you PLEASE leave the name as LV-SPAWN.EXE, the past 2 loaders
15,01    I've made, I havn't done the art for, and I never get my name on it.

15,01    Please leave it as LV-SPAWN.EXE

15,01    thanks
