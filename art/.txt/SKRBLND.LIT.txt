15,01        00It happened last week.  I mean, it happened last week while I was15      03|
00,01assembling softacos.  I thought about where my life was going, you know, what  03|
00,01I was really going to do with the rest of my life. I mean, assuming there IS   03|
00,01a rest to my life.  My cousin Ernie got hit by a bus when he was three. But    03|
00,01you know, I look both ways before I cross the street.15                          03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00But anyways, I'm sitting there assembling softacos, with my little    03|
00,01purple hat falling off my head (what stupid uniforms) and the fact of the15      03|
00,01matter is is that I can see myself in the reflection of the countertop, and    03|
00,01that the only thing that changes about this job is my face.  As I grow older,  03|
00,01my face will get more wrinkled. I mean, that will be a long time from now, but 03|
00,01the thought that I'd be here at Taco Bell for that long is really depressing.  03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00I look at my manager sometimes, and he's like 40 or something, and    03|
00,01he always looks so tired. I mean, hell, I'm tired, but he's had 40 fucking15     03|
00,01YEARS to be tired.  I don't want to turn into that. And that's all I'm doing   03|
00,01right now, turning into a middle aged wageslave. Fuck that.15                    03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00Last time I really rebelled was when I nailed everything in my room   03|
00,01to the ceiling. My parents had a fit. It wasn't so bad except for the fact that03|
00,01the nails pulled out and eventually everything fell back down. (The bed and    03|
00,01desk really sucked, but the other stuff, like paperbacks, were sort of funny.  03|
00,01Everytime I came into my room different stuff had fallen down.) I mean, that   03|
00,01doesn't even count for rebellion. The only other stuff I had done was take15     03|
00,01all of the bolts out of the desks in school. Heh. Actually, that WAS pretty    03|
00,01funny.15                                                                         03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00So I look over and see my friend Josh, working across from me, and    03|
00,01he's got a headset on and talks to the fucked up taco bell customers on it15     03|
00,01now and then. I figure that's gotta be better than just staring at those stupid03|
00,01monitors all day like I do.  I wave at him and he pulls off his headset.15       03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00"What's up?" he asks. "I've got a plan." I said. So I told him about  03|
00,01what I had been thinking about, and what we should do about it. I told him all 03|
00,01the details, and after awhile he started to shake his head. "No way. We'd get  03|
00,01fired for sure." but then he got this smile and started passing it around to   03|
00,01the cashiers up front and to everyone else except the manager.15                 03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00At exactly 4:30, everything went according to plan.  The manager15      03|
00,01went into the little room where we keep the keg mix of the soda fluid (ours    03|
00,01is sort of a weird taco bell...) and we set everything up.15                     03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00The first step was of course to lock him in there.  We contemplated   03|
00,01just putting guacamole all along the edge of the door because that shit could  03|
00,01glue anything.. but we just ripped one of the refrigerator units off the wall  03|
00,01(bolt cutters from the toolbox..) and had three guys push it in front of the   03|
00,01door. From that point on, chaos ensued.15                                        03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00Refried beans, cooked, whole tacos, people's random orders, all was   03|
00,01put on trays and hurled across the restraunt.  People in the front didn't15      03|
00,01know what to think.  People shotgunned mild sauce packets across the room so   03|
00,01hard that they actually burst when they hit the wall.  Then somebody, I think  03|
00,01it was probably Josh, started tearing out the microwave ovens.15                 03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00"Long live the revolution!" someone shouted.  I dunno about revolution03|
00,01but it was pretty clear to me that I wasn't the only one who was pissed off.   03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00The first microwave bounced off the front window, and the one that    03|
00,01followed it cracked it into this spiderweb pattern. The soda fountain machine  03|
00,01was pushed over, ice went everywhere, and by this point the customers were15     03|
00,01fighting back. It was all getting pretty surreal when some guy pulled up to    03|
00,01the drivethru window and started yelling about his order.  Everybody turned    03|
00,01and looked at him, and proceeded to throw anything in their hands thru the15     03|
00,01drivethru window.  He screeched away with tacos, burritos, salsa, tortillas,   03|
00,01and an ocean of soda washing around in the bottom of his truck cab. Josh15       03|
00,01took a hammer and smashed off the little price display and threw it after him. 03|
15,01                                                                               03|
15,01         00The prep area was trashed, the cash registers had been broken into    03|
