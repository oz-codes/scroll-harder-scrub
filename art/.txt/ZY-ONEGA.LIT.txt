15,01Doublespeak bounces off frank ears
15,01tuned to the short wave
15,01like flung inflections off a grinding garbage truck.
15,01When I am thinking in semaphore
15,01it is difficult to be precise.

15,01Onegai shimasu, whines the escalator,
15,01with an ingratiating sneer.
15,01Sashiagemashoo ka, squeals the washing machine,
15,01as it churns its fat thorax.
15,01Subete kudasai, whispers the bicycle's wheel
15,01caressing the unclean road.

15,01I listen to the conversations
15,01of store mannequins hired for their obsequiousness.
15,01All that reaches me through the filter
15,01produced by ignorance and innocence
15,01is platitude and politesse,
15,01words of greeting, of indication of station,
15,01the shuddered whispers of name and hour.
