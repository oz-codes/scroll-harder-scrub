15,01   One day, as I was walking around my house barefoot, I stepped on a raisin.

15,01   To my surprise, I could actually taste raisins!  It was an unbelievable
15,01sensation.

15,01   So, I emptied out the refrigerator onto the floor, and began stepping on
15,01food.  Sure enough, I could taste the milk, the cheese, the tomatoes and the
15,01butter.  I shouldn't have stepped on that strange blue loaf though.

15,01   Anyway, I had to go out, so I decided I should probably put on some socks
15,01and shoes, but when I put on my socks, I immediately puked.  I never realized
15,01how bad those puppies tasted.

15,01   Now, that might not have been so bad, but as gravity tends to make you puke
15,01down, I puked on my feet.  I think I just lay on the floor twitching for about
15,015 minutes before I could finally drag myself to the tub to have a bath.

15,01   Soap tastes bad.

15,01   Anyway, I took out a pair of clean socks and tossed some mint extract on
15,01them, and that seemed to help.

15,01   So, I headed out into the world with my newfound ability.

15,01   On the way, I passed a bank.  I saw that it was bring robbed!

15,01   "How can I use my power to help mankind, and stop this robbery?"  I thought,
15,01and began taking off my shoes.

15,01   Then I realized how useless the ability to taste things with your feet is in
15,01such a situation, and sheepishly began to put my socks back on.

15,01   You know, that gum stuck to the street doesn't lose ALL its flavour...

15,01   Forgetting I was still in front of the bank, I gathered up my footwear and
15,01started to move on.

15,01   Suddenly the doors burst open and the bank robber tripped over me.  I was
15,01the first one to get back up, so I kicked him in the face.  Man, some people
15,01taste bad.  He had eaten bacon and eggs for breakfast.

15,01   His blood started pouring out all over the pavement.  I was in such a state
15,01of shock, I couldn't move.  At least, not until I tasted the blood.  Now that
15,01was bad.

15,01   By the time the police got there, I was running around the grassy field
15,01across the street, in the sprinklers, shouting, "Ewwwwww!  Ewwwwww!"

15,01   Well, it didn't take them long to lock me up in the local loony bin.

15,01   So, when the doctor came to ask what was wrong with me, I interjected before
15,01the cop could answer, "I can taste with my feet!  That would drive anyone
15,01nuts!"

15,01   They locked me up in their tightest straightjacket and threw me in their
15,01tightest room.

15,01   Whenever I was brought a plate of food, I'd just stomp on it until I decided
15,01if I wanted to eat it or not.

15,01   Well, it's pretty dull in here.  And padded rooms, I gotta tell you, taste
15,01BAD.  Once, though, in a struggle with many doctors and nurses, I managed to
15,01stick my feet down a nurse's blouse.  Well, maybe it's not such a useless
15,01ability after all!
