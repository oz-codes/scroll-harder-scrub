15,01IntentNet is the Manifest Support Net, and has recently been scaled down to
15,01include only Manifest related topics.  We encourage the Sysops of all Manifest
15,01Sites and Member boards to join the net, which consists of around 6 echos, in
15,01order to help the Seniors communicate and give assignments to the members, 
15,01and to make it easier for users to request work from Manifest.  
15,01   Any Manifest affiliated board will be accepted, simply edit INTENT.INT with
15,01your favorite text editor, rename it to the first 8 letters of your board,
15,01(ie MINDFUK.INT or EVILINTE.INT), and get it to me one of the following ways:
15,01  
15,01  # Post it in the IntentNet Manifest Members base on a current IntentNet Node
15,01  # Apply to Mindfuk, 916-662-5283, and send it in feedback, or your new user
15,01    application letter to Deranged Evil.
15,01  # Temporarily enter 3:100/0 into your mailer, and send it as Netmail to
15,01    Deranged Evil (3:916/0).
15,01  # Send it to a Manifest Site or WHQ. (This may take a while longer to get to
15,01    me, however)

15,01Well, hope to get a lot of sites onto this, once I get you proccesed, I will
15,01try to contact you, every how you asked me to in your application, and give
15,01you your Address.  After you have that, I will send you the updated Nodelist, 
15,01via your mailer, so make sure you have one up.  All nodes will need to poll
15,013:916/0 nigthly.
