15,01I am a man of a thousand stars
15,01Hidden beneath my eyes,
15,01And in the land of the dead
15,01There is no right and wrong-

15,01- The Perfect Harmony of Discreation -

15,01The winds of depression sing a song,
15,01I know that song's heart and core,
15,01And I know that beneath the music there
15,01  is one soul,
15,01The music of the muse is not for the rich
15,01  but for the poor-

15,01The dragons must die,
15,01Misconception will not be tolerated...
15,01And in the aftermath the smoke opens
15,01  upon a new revolution,
15,01Coming to fulfill the "uberman",
15,01The sun, our father is calling us back-

15,01Facing up
15,01Towards the sky,
15,01I hear the people's soloumn cries,
15,01No more... no remorse,
15,01The end is so near-

15,01This is no time for woe,
15,01I'll give the universe armegedon 
15,01Just one more time....
15,01Can you imagine the perfect harmony of destruction?
15,01Who would burn first?
15,01What part of the sky would I carry in my heart?
15,01In the final aeon,
15,01In those last fleeting moments,
15,01The spirit will find the will to carry on-
