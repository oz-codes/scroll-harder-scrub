15,011.  One more month and the scene just keeps getting wierder.  While us iCE
15,01    students were busy not doing homework and answering calls from the
15,01    ACiD Staff, the older guys were busy going bankrupt, curing people of
15,01    dangerous diseases, helping grey-haired wirey women across crowded city-
15,01    streets, and perfecting their shadow puppets.  Oh, they also were answering
15,01    calls from the ACiD Staff, although not as much since the operation.  I'd
15,01    not lie if I said we managed to pick up alot of new blood this month, but I
15,01    did cut down the cherry tree.   Sadly we had to get rid of alot of inactive 

15,01    guys, though.  Please see #5 below for less.  It was alot like the scene in 

15,01    Goodfellas, except we were driving a Volkswagon Bus and had the bodies in 
15,01    the back.  And instead of a knife we used a vending machine.  You should 
15,01    have been there... it was really neat to watch.  We found that after we 
15,01    emptied all the fluids from the bag, we could use them to make the truck 
15,01    into a hot tub.  So we made it on the bevel...

15,012.  iCE VGA Welcomes a whole slew of new artists.  First off, as you have
15,01    probably heard, the famous duo of Catbones and Sprite have joined the
15,01    ranks from ACiD. The second artist without a handle has joined iCE; Tom
15,01    Crofton is our resident landscape expert. Other illustrious artists to
15,01    grace us with their presence are Supreme, Salmon, and finally Digital
15,01    Interface.  We have also been joined by a non-illustrious guy by the
15,01    name of Mass Delusion.  He joins as a Web Coordinator.  Welcome, mice
15,01    and men!

15,012X. This pack was brought to you by the letter F.

15,013.  A couple folks left iCE for other lands this month. A fond farewell to
15,01    Maestro, who is taking a vacation from big groups, taxes, and
15,01    existentialism; White Knight, who needs the time to devote to his collection

15,01    of plaid parachutes; and Unsane, who has gone to Saga to be an aardvark.

15,014.  Future Assassin demanded a greet or he would kick Friar's tail. Friar
15,01    hereby screams "YO! FASSYSASSIN! GREET THIS! <gesture>" =)

15,015.  Several artists have been removed from the list for lack of a pulse. They
15,01    are Rainmaker, Animal, Biscuit, Cooly, Incubus, Highness, Isosceles,
15,01    Pnakotic, Death Adder, Anarchy, ImageX, Frog, Airborn, Soul Rebel and
15,01    Sorcerer's Son. As always, these people are inactive and are off the
15,01    active memberlist; they haven't been booted for genetic defects or
15,01    because of the fact that they indulge in wearing women's undergarments
15,01    and/or defocation on Friar's doorstep.  In fact, they're not even out
15,01    of the group.  It's just this wierd thing about iCE that once someone
15,01    is Inactive we take them off the Active Memberlist.  <Shrug>...

15,015X. If you hear this whisper, you are dying.

15,016.  Basehead has released a musicdisk. One of the reputed masters of the
15,01    scene, his cutting-edge music can be found on ftp.cdrom.com in the
15,01    directory /demos/incoming/music/disks/fm-lotus.zip. Check it out!

15,017.  Crusader is a new game from Origin. It's CD-Rom based and features
15,01    music from Necros and Basehead. It's great to see scene music getting
15,01    the recognition it deserves.  Go out and buy it, but like they're not
15,01    getting any royalties, so just ummm... borrow it from a friend.

15,018.  The Freedom CD has been released. For $12, you can get an audio
15,01    CD featuring songs by Necros, Nemesis, Future Assassin, as well as a
15,01    second data CD full of famous demoscene productions.  The handsome 2-CD
