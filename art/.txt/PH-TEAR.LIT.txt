15,01Death ain't much really.....
15,01when there isn't anything else to look to....
15,01cry here....cry there
15,01it don't matter no more....
15,01fer some it does.....
15,01others... not.....

15,01when the night seems brighter than the day.....
15,01darkness brings you comfort....
15,01you don't like it, but you can't stay away from it...
15,01enveloping your soul... your mind...
15,01gripping its nails into you... making you bleed from within...
15,01pain unbearable.. can't break the hold....
15,01you search for the exit... but can't find it....

15,01People walk across your fields.... trespassers them all
15,01but you care not anymore.....
15,01let them walk....
15,01let them run.....
15,01let them drive their spiked heels into your skull....
15,01you don't care....
15,01wake up.... in time to go to sleep forever....

15,01peace of mind... is all I need sometime
15,01but I can't get it....
15,01no one will give it ..... no one receives.....
15,01fingers burn and ache.... legs move slower.....
15,01you recede into the corner, waiting.....
15,01sliding.....
15,01let it pass....

15,01my forest on my mountain thins away..... the trees are cut down more and
15,01more...
15,01but you can't stop it... I can't stop it....

15,01there is only one hope for man.... but in that hope lies an obstacle...
15,01I am ready to cross it....
15,01but not by my hand.....
15,01I wait fer a guide to help me across...
15,01guide me through the dark....
15,01light the path so I may see where I drag my pain....

15,01leave me alone.....
