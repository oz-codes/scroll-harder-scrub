00,01yet another lazy case vermin formed after a little fucking letter newer ment
00,01to be any hurting letter.. actually, vermin took it pretty serious ;)

15,01<vermin>
00,01well, flux, i originally wrote a rather short reply to what you wrote there,
00,01but later understood that such ignorance couldnt be dealt with that easily.
00,01how in the hell can you say that i took anything seriously? how the fucking
00,01hell can you know what _I_ mean about this so-called "letter" which i havent
00,01even read? this again proves that you are nothing but a fucking moron, flux,
00,01a fucking gimp, acting like you know everything. you saying that deranged is
00,01a joke just adds up to it. how the fuck should you know that? and how in the
00,01hell, i ask, how in the hell, can you say that i took what you wrote, and that
00,01i didnt read, seriously, when i wrote a comment like the one i did? any fuckin
00,01moron should understand that the entire entity of what i wrote in that infofile 
00,01was complete and utter bullshit! but nono, you didnt understand shit.
00,01i quote you, "a little fucking letter newer ment to be any hurting letter.. 
00,01actually," *FLUX* "took it pretty serious"

14,01and here goes some pr slagging; flux/pr was ruomoured to
14,01be writing/have written an article for pancake#1, about
14,01deranged being a joke. well, flux, its great to see that
14,01someone who has never been a member of deranged, and that15   00<-- from some
14,01doesnt even know a single drg member, is so informed about15      00darn info-
14,01the actual purpouse of deranged. well, for your info;15           00file
14,01deranged is not a joke. deranged is a group we formed15           00(cant remember) 
14,01right after the release of the bmb-0496 pack, formed
14,01entirely to piss off bamboosh. we are the antichristian
14,01hordes from hell, out to KILL and DESTROY the entire norw-
14,01egian artscene! and just so its said, pr is now our new tar-
14,01gets, and we are after you. we will kidnap you and burn your
14,01house to the ground, flux. we are evil.

15,01- reply by flux ---------------------------------------------------------------

00,01then, i got your history and meaning of drg. what i said in that "article" was
00,01just as you are telling. and i think most of us think you are a joke. but now,
00,01we got your vision. and everything is clear. i wont touch you again :)

00,01sorry, but i just have to lie down on my floor and cry of laugh..

15,01<vermin>
00,01i certainly hope youre not so stupid you believed that thing. if you really
00,01did, though, i must say that im flattered to know someone so downright stupid
00,01as you.15 00"i think most of us think you are a joke" <-- HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!@
00,01it really amazes me that both you and gomez ended up in the same group, as you 
00,01seem to be just as bloody stupid.15 00no matter how jokingly you try to formulate
00,01what you say, its still one hell of a task for me to take this as a joke. i
00,01never intended you to even reply to that thing. if people would reply to all
00,01the bullshit i write in the deranged infofiles, then i wouldnt have anything
00,01else to do than reply back. but anyhow, its nice to know you read it. pffft.
