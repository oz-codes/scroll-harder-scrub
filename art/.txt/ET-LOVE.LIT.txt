15,01Love

15,01As I lie here in the still of night
15,01Staring at my ceiling above
15,01In the darkness my mind takes flight
15,01Pondering the question of love.

15,01The poets and dreamers knew where to look
15,01The answer was always there from the start
15,01Not in any song, poem or book
15,01That wisdom is inside my heart.

15,01My soul calls out to another
15,01It's other half, torn away at birth
15,01It lies in the heart of my lover
15,01The person meant for me on this Earth.

15,01So as I lie here in the dark of night
15,01I know, without a doubt, my heart is right.
