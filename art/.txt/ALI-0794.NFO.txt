15,01        man, this month was both fast and slow.  fast, it went by.
15,01        slow, i didn't do shit, i can tell you that much. :)  I started
15,01        a mega length Donkey Kong/Mario ansi and stuff, but it's not even
15,01        close to being done.  So, that means i'm not accounted for.
15,01        Several members aren't, we shouldn't even REALLY release this.. but
15,01        hey, our fans on IRC beckon us to irrationality!

15,01        enough nonsense.

15,01        now, we know this isn't our best pack.
15,01        but we tried, and trying is all that counts.
15,01        now look in the mirror, go on, do it now.
15,01        say to yourself, i know i can do better than this.
15,01        because i'm good enough, i'm strong enough, and doggone it,
15,01        people like us.

15,01        anyhow.. not much has happened this month - a bunch of
15,01        new members and sites that were pending and stuff like that

15,01        ansi - dive - this dude kicks ass, nuff said. glad to have the MF
15,01                on the alive side of the scene.  call his board too.
15,01        ascii - tinyz - he's the mack from israel.  what more do we say?
15,01                doing a joint effort with alive and kts!ascii! w0rd!
15,01        couriering - winter rose - the ice courier, she's helping us out
15,01                too, because our couriering sucks.  as you've noticed. (or
15,01                not as the case may be)
15,01        coding - str!ct9 - a new coder, did a little loader for me this
15,01                pack, looks strong, hoping to see strong shit from da d00d.

15,01        deletions - the alive couriering staff from before.
15,01                schitzo - guy hasn't called in ever, fone bill etc, no hard
15,01                feelings with this guy.
15,01                nightrain - went to shiver or some shit like that.. who
15,01                cares.
15,01                smirk - i dunno if he's gone.. things are up in the air.
15,01                denizen ][ - read below.. down aways...

15,01                Let's just say nothing is new, byteman has been moving, and
15,01        the thing is still sorry.  We might have an all new viewer soon, but
15,01        who knows, and if you can code viewers, we need you.  I can't get
15,01        the thing to run on my pooter with sound, so i dunno about y'all..
15,01        but the mod included is new, unreleased, just for our viewer!
15,01        It's by Quarex, of TFX.  The song title is 'Barbituadee' and is just
15,01        a really mellow, chilling song to view this pack with.  You'll
15,01        probably like this to the cool but repetetive 'smoke on the water'
15,01        mod that we had been including. <grin> have fun, and big greets go
15,01        to Quarex, TFX productions, meet him on #TRAX.

15,01                Well, ya know how I said for sushi x to get in touch with
15,01        us?  I just happened to see his board number on CZ! and gave it a
15,01        call.  He's back on Alive dist status and has joined MRi network.
15,01        welcome aboard sush-meister!  A couple months ago, Sociopath/Maestro
15,01        agreed on a deal, for an alive site, well the deal wasn't completed
15,01        until this month.  Now Death Row in 413 will help represent us in
15,01        the east.  Welcome to alive and mri!

15,01                Big thanks to Beastie, my now long time friend, for agreeing
15,01        to allow us to convert our HQ to member run boards.  CZ!, has been
15,01        converted from the alive western hq into the alive advice and
15,01        consolation hq, my personal crying grounds. =)  Beastie has helped
15,01        me out more than he knows, and I thank him for it again and again,
15,01        regardless of his belief in deserving it. =)  Congratulations to
15,01        the mack daddy of alive - the ever working and promoting - the
15,01        terbium meister himself - ABOMINATION!  Abom's board Temporal
15,01        Distortion has assumed the western hq position, and rightfully so
15,01        for the work he's put into the group.  Thank you abom, you've helped
