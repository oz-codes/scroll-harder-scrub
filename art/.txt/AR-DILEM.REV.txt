15,01One man preys, the other tells lies
15,01One man obeys, the other defies
15,01One man can't see, yet is far from blind
15,01A veiled mystery, that plays with the mind
15,01If God exists, he should've known
15,01That mankind resists, 'to each his own'
15,01He damned us to hell, for being his children
15,01He hammered the bell, and summoned his brethren
15,01And sent down his Son, to die for our sins
15,01His world is a game, where nobody wins
15,01All of us lose, the fact remains true
15,01It's okay to hurt, as long as it's not you
15,01Death is the end, no matter how hard you try
15,01For one man to live, the other, must die.
