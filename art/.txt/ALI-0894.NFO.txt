15,01        we're rebuilding.  after that pack, who wouldn't?  basically,
15,01alive rebuilding means is that i took a 2 week vacation and abused the hell
15,01out of a at&t calling card harassing alive members to make up for last
15,01month.  so far, it seems to be working as we're on the right track with LOTS
15,01of production, and a new member or two.
