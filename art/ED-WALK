15,01two, four, six
15,01twelve, sixteen, eighteen?
15,01do you even know how many?

15,01you let them violate you
15,01and take away your purity
15,01and you're never getting that back
15,01again

15,01you let them touch you
15,01and caress you
15,01& kiss you
15,01& enter you-
15,01two,
15,01three at a time,
15,01on videotape
15,01and you don't even care

15,01perhaps
15,01maybe you do care
15,01but you didn't then
15,01you just fucked and walked away
15,01fucked and walked away
15,01fuck and walk away

15,01but
15,01tell me
15,01tell me you care
15,01tell me that you're different now
15,01i don't care if you're serious
15,01& i don't care if you mean it
15,01i just want to smile
15,01and hold your hand
15,01and not feel their stares
15,01and their comments
15,01and their jokes

15,01i just want to be happy
15,01really happy
15,01happy with you-
15,01before you walk away
