15,01        04A blaze of fury swept 00to the East, the red's 04were falling fast
15,01      04The day the mighty bl00ackened force reigned betray04al with a blast
15,01       04A nation driven b00y purest thoughts 14of s00upremacy fo04r their race
04,01    To conquer the fea00red of the leader14s dre00ams would set th04e deadly pace
04,01   In all the brilli00ance he brought t14o wa00r he never once cou04ld understand
04,01    The hate that 00fueled the rage o14f hi00s reign wo14ul00d deal the 04final hand
04,01In the town that 00bore the name of th14e d00ragon, t14he one 00which clo04uded his goals
04,01 Would the black 00night find his fate 14rev00ealed 14in 00the 14dea00th of 3 04million souls
04,01 In the dead of 00a winter unlike that w14hic00h 14he 00knew did 14fa00te begi04n it's course
04,01   To stop the b00loody vein of hate whi14ch th00e world watched witho04ut remorse
15,01     04If the devi00l created 14th00e evil f14ace that 00brought this holoc04aust to be
15,01      04Then 'twas 00God who co14pi00ed t14he im00age i14n S00talin to end thi04s tragedy
04,01At the end of the 00thousand y14ea00r 14re00ign of the 14Rei00ch, The world 04would finally know
04,01 The horror of aff00liction and 14pa00inful remembra14nce 00that the Na04zi's came to show
04,01    The fate of hate 00is so clearly mapped fro14m G00od's own wor04ds from long ago
04,01    That for what-so-e00ver a man shall reap 14wil00l be from wha04t a man shall sew
15,01     04Take just one momen00t to ponder the pa14st 00before you d04ecide your stand
04,01And say a prayer of hope in 00remembrance of those nearly 04ridden from our land
