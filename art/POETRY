15,01                        Chapter One - The Meeting 
15,01With a big KRAK the immense stone club hit the table, splitting it in half.
15,01Spineripper was really enjoying himself, the humans had stood up with quite
15,01a fight. Especially the men around the cart, they had fought really hard,
15,01some of the clan had even suffered some slight wounds from the combat. Now
15,01he was chasing the round man who had been hiding under the table in the cart.
15,01He had looked eminent, but now he was just a crawling figure on the ground
15,01in his colorful clothes begging them to let him go. But he would make a great
15,01snack before the feast.

15,01The engagement was over and the ground in the clearing was crimson red of
15,01remains from the battle. Here and there a troll sat chewing on a bone.
15,01Spineripper was really happy with the loot, it was full of gems and quite a
15,01lot of the yellow metal crap that the humans seemed to value so much. He
15,01couldn't understand why, couldn't be eaten and wasn't good for anything, but
15,01they usually kept it just to annoy the humans. But the gems were really good,
15,01nothing is tastier than a fine diamond or jewel. Yes the troll have teeth
15,01that excel even diamonds in strength. There was also about 10 tasty horses.
15,01Yes it would be fine feast tonight. There was also a few of them fragile
15,01things that his brother Akrug liked so much. Akrug never wanted to come with
15,01them on their plunders. He just sat in his cave looking into one of the
15,01fragile things or boks as he called them, or walking about in the forest
15,01without bashing any of the animals. That is the most strange thing about
15,01Akrug, he never bashes anything not even wild boars.

15,01Meanwhile back in the cave Akrug sat reading one of his many books. He had
15,01never cared much about going around bashing things and then eating them. It
15,01seemed so pointless. And for eating live things, he couldn't even bring
15,01himself to eat flowers so he was on a constant diet of stone. He had a codex
15,01that he would never kill anything. So there he sat chewing on a piece of
15,01granite shrugging to the thought of what his clan probably was doing to
15,01some innocent people who had been unfortunate enough to be in their way.
15,01But that was just the way things are.
15,01He couldn't help feeling superior. He had an insight into things in a way
15,01the others of clan could only dream of. And his brother Spineripper who was
15,01head of the clan often asked him for advice on what to do. Spineripper is a
15,01natural leader, looking very ferocious and grim. Around his neck he wears a
15,01necklace made of Vertebrae from his victims, it went around his neck 3 times
15,01as it was now and he was still going strong. He also has the biggest club
15,01in the whole clan. A three arms long branch with a big sharp stone through
15,01it.

15,01                  Trolls lurching In the forest waiting for,
15,01                  the humans perched upon great white horses,
15,01                     the unaware coming food for the day 
15,01                        the upcoming bashing feast!
15,01                                    Da Hunt - Akrug BoneSpitter

15,01Akrug put the book down when he heard the first sounds of the coming trolls,
15,01they sounded really cheerful and satisfied. The looting must have been good.
15,01He replaced the book in the shelf. His little cave stacked with books in
15,01bookshelves and in piles on the floor, in a corner there was some hay for
15,01sleeping on. He had also a table in the middle of the room, with a candle
15,01and a chair. It all smelled of stone. Unlike the others caves he had neither
15,01unfinished bones lying in corners nor raw meat stacked somewhere in a corner
15,01and was lacking the general stench of rotting meat and shit.

15,01He carefully stuck his head out of the cave opening. They were all back, some
15,01of them limping but otherwise they seemed to be okay. Spineripper was up
15,01front carrying a big chest that looked very heavy.
15,01- Hey Spineripper, what's in the chest? ,he called out as they came within
15,01   hearing.
15,01- In mah box? Juz da loot. ,Spineripper answered. "An sum of dem boks you
15,01   like so much."
15,01- Oh good, well I'm going to take a walk in forest now, you can drop the
15,01   books outside my cave.
15,01- Uha shure I make dat latah. Now we FEAST! Are ye sure ye don't want enny
15,01   food? We got sum horshes.
15,01- No I don't think so, but thanks all the same.

15,01He always tried not to be near the trolls when they started feasting. It
15,01made him feel sick and he didn't enjoy being bashed by drunken trolls.
15,01Because a drunken troll is just about the most dangerous thing there is.
15,01Especially if he has drunken some of old Maltbasher's spirits.
