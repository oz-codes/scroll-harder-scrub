00,01As he inserts the needle,
00,01To a vein already infected.
00,01He tries to remember,
00,01His parents, selected.

00,013 years to the day,
00,01His father got hit.
00,013 years he shall pay,
00,01For a crime he didn't commit.

00,01Guilty until proven innocent,
00,01Was the rule we followed.
00,01They put the gun to ya head,
00,01They pull the trigger and make ya swollow.

00,01A Child without freedom,
00,01Is like a man without a soul.
00,01He tried to fight the system,
00,01As they took total control.

00,01He lost his life, his job,
00,01Now he feels the poison.
00,01As it makes his body throb,
00,01And twist out of shape.

00,01They keep us from knowing the truth,
00,01To which we are ignorant,
00,01They take away our lives, our future,
00,01As we stand afar a cry.

00,01Slaves to the system,
00,01Nowhere to hide.
00,01Raise your fist in defiance,
00,01Man13datory su04icide
