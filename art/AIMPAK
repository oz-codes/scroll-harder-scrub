15,01+-+ There is not much to say.. we dont want to bore you with the life story     

15,01  of AiM and alot of other bullshit that other groups stick in their info file  

15,01  so we will just get on with the some small info about the pak and the Greetz.

15,01+-+                                                                           
15,01+-+ The Pak Contains Most of the work that AiM did durring its first month of 
15,01 existance. You will notice that AiM lacks VGA artists so if there are       
15,01 any out there who want to join please call.. What AiM DOES have is probibly   
15,01 the best group of Music Composers anywhere around this area and we included  
15,01 4 Songs by them in the Pak. Use the Future Crew MDPlayer(included) to listen 
15,01 we realy think you will enjoy their work.                                    
15,01 The Pak also contains a Lame-ass viewer :)
15,01 We had a great viewer ready when an EXCIDENT!(Caused by one of the best coders
15,01 in US!!!) crashed Lord Primez hard drive... Too bad.. the Viewer in the pak
15,01 was done in quite a hurry(2hours) and has NOTHING. 
15,01 But hay! you'll use Acidview anywayz. 

15,01+-+                                                                           
15,01+-+ Distribution Cites :                                                      
15,01 Unlike most other Ansi groups AiM doesnt take ANY dist cites. We only want   
15,01 a HQ in each large part of the world and thats about all.. As facts show     
15,01 people will still get the pak. From other boards or most likely through the   
15,01 InterNet and there is not use bothering with tons of cites and sysops and    
15,01 Couriers..

15,01 Even tho some people think this is Lame, AiM will not be releasing `PAKS'    
15,01 on monthly bases.. Sometime there will be a back every week, and some time   
15,01 a pak every year! We dont set deadlines for our Artists due to the fact      
15,01 that we dont want them to rush with their work..                             
15,01 +-+                                                                          
15,01 +-+ Requests :                                                               
15,01 Unlike other groups(once again) AiM does not take $$ for their work.. At least 

15,01 not yet anyway. If you wish to request and ANSi by AiM please Contact        
15,01 LUC or LORD PRIME on Dying Breed BBS or any other quality board around the   
15,01 213-310-818 area.

15,01# We would like to thank Reflex, Ti, Hash and the rest of the people who annoyed

15,01  us to release the pak : we REALY COULD have done this without you.          
15,01# We would like to thank the Cool boards around the 310-818 area for giving us
15,01  a reason to leve : FAST WAREZ                                               
15,01# Special thanx goes to C-G of UNiON for his help on Spectrum.                
15,01# We would like to greet the following groups :

15,01  to see cool work from ya..

15,01                                                                              
15,01Giving greets to every person we know is kinda stupid so we will just skip this 

15,01part. We would simply like to thank everyone who supported AiM and everyone who 

15,01helped up in any possible way. If you wish to read the greets from the people
15,01that made this info file read at the very end.
15,01                                                                              
15,01Wow! The info file is already over.. and only 65+ lines!!!                    
15,01Anyway : We hope you liked the AiM AnSi Pak, and hope you will continue to    
15,01support AiM in the future.                                                    
15,01Next month we will have a longer and hopefully cooler NewsLetter.             
15,01                                                                              
15,01
