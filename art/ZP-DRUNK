15,01                A rambling man
15,01                Without his senses,
15,01                Drunk,
15,01                A "comic",
15,01                That's what he says he is.
15,01                Singing meaningless tunes
15,01                From the past.
15,01                The conductor quiets the man
15,01                So full of pain,
15,01                On the near empty train.
15,01                A fool speaks to him,
15,01                And again the rambling begins.
15,01                The fool leaves
15,01                And the drunk babbles again,
15,01                Meaninglessly, 
15,01                To himself.
15,01                Speaking of worthless things,
15,01                Is this man who would be king,
15,01                Or so he says.
