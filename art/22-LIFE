15,01life comes with the press of a button
15,01it takes a while to start up only cause it's one of the slower models
15,01eventually it starts and is waiting for a command
15,01life does what i tell it, and all of it's mistakes or errors are because of me
15,01life doesn't give me a bad turn becuase it feels like it,
15,01it does it cause i fucked up.

15,01my life stares back at me, it's face is wide and it's expression is calm.
15,01i revolve around it and it revolves around me.
15,01without each other, neither of us would have a use.
15,01my life has limited purpose.  and that of which i have not found out yet.
15,01maybe life will help me in a few years.. yet i don't really know.
15,01knowledge is somthing i am short on.  but my life teaches me things.
15,01it teaches me about itself.  
15,01without life i wouldn't have purpose.. i would have no chance of "success".
15,01i discovered life only 7 months ago.  i had heard of it before that, but it's
15,01purpose seems obsolete to me.
15,01life lead me to friends, to fun, to porno pictures on the internet.
15,01i tell others what i do all day, and their comments to me are, "get a life",
15,01or "gee that must be fun".  but it is, because it is my life, not theirs.

15,01i love my life, and had considered giving it a name.  but that'd be just weird.
15,01i guess it sorta does have a name tho.. i mean this whole time i've been calling
15,01it "life".  so maybe that's what i'll call it for now on.  yes.. it is my life.
15,01life is not an open road, or a untravelled path.  life is a motherboard with
15,01wires and circuts and memory chips.. life flows in the direction i tell it, and
15,01it does what i say.  and in return, i do what life tells ME to do.  we are one,
15,01me and life.  we live and sleep in the same room.  

15,01i love you life.
