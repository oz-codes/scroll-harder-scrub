15,01        I'd like to explain something that happened to me recently. I turned
15,01        19. I started spinning. I am playing with trackers and dreaming of
15,01        getting my own Junos and Rolands. I no longer do drugs habitually.
15,01        I am in love. I am doing many things, going many places, and trying
15,01        to leave my mark in the cold, stone world that we live in.
15,01        Unfortunatly, I haven't had the time to draw much lately, and this
15,01        is my first ascii in close to three months. Now, I'll arrogantly state
15,01        that my style still rocks ass and all that, but I can feel my
15,01        skills slipping away, and my heart turning to other places. I wish
15,01        this wasn't so. I was always the MOST up and at-em scener... the
15,01        ascii kid who would call LD to pump packs to other boards, the one
15,01        who volunteered to courier other people's works and packs, the
15,01        guy who'd give you his honest opinion about what was going on - not
15,01        because I was involved with my ego, but because I had a genuine
15,01        concern for the scene, and ya'll my friends in the scene.
15,01        But as we get older, we all drop out and lose contact with those
15,01        things we used to love... and I will not hesitate to say I love
15,01        the computer underground scene, and all you people in it. We are
15,01        the youth, the rebel-bad-asses, the ones with the insight and
15,01        beliefs that makes us just a BIT cooler than the rest of the
15,01        world's population.
15,01        I've seen many people come in go in my time. I started drawing
15,01        ascii in late 94 for the group Fidelis, formed my own group with
15,01        my beloved C4nn called Hallucination, joined Ash, Basic, Soap,
15,01        Remorse, Noname, couriered many many warez, did it all. But dammit,
15,01        its not as fun any more.
15,01        This isn't a going away speech or anything, I HOPE to God that I
15,01        have the time and energy to hang out and continue to draw, and keep
15,01        as much of a presence in the scene as I can... but sometimes, when
15,01        you get older, everything goes to shit, and you have to piece
15,01        together your REAL life, rather than hold on too tightly to a virtual
15,01        one.
15,01        In conclusion (my favorite way to end an essay), I just thought I'd
15,01        share the point of view that goes through the head of someone who's
15,01        been very dedicated to the scene, has formed a strong comraderie
15,01        with people he will most likely never meet, and is sad to see it
15,01        beginning to slip away. It'd be much easier for me to take the stance
15,01        of many people who leave and go "Fuck yall, yall are losers. I have
15,01        a real life now". But the thing is, people who do that are fucking
15,01        herbs, and get NO respect from me or anyone I consider friends.
15,01        Anyway, no goodbyes... just much respect and love to the computer
15,01        underground, who has helped me dream and achieve in real life as well
15,01        as in the modeming undahground community.
