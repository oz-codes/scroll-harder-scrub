15,01        02Hello artscene, 11dfuse02 is here.
15,01        02I hope everyone had a great year and a nice chrismas and so on, 
15,01        02anyway i did. 
15,01        02By the way, welcome to our fourth close encounter!!@

15,01        02When i get my hungry hands on an ( dont' get me wrong here ! )
15,01        02new artpackage i'm very exited to see what the artist's have 
15,01        02come up with.
15,01        02I belive there's a huge lack of inspiration as well as creativity
15,01        02in the scene today.
15,01        02It's not enough to make fantastic outline's on a picture ( or a 
15,01        02font, logo for that matter ) if you can't use the colors and        
15,01        02design the thing right, it won't turn out great, at all.
15,01        02Just watch a demo or a smaller intro, it doesn't matter if the 
15,01        02code is awesome, if there's no design put into it.

15,01       02 In the latest acrylic, #05, there was an article about the ops in      
15,01        02#ansi, some guys mean that if they can't draw they shouldn't have 
15,01        02ops, well i guess they have a point.
15,01        02Ok, it's their channel, the make up the rules, right?!, but they
15,01        02don't have to be such assholes as some are, banning people for 
15,01        02nothing, and stuff like that,15 02that's what i think anyway.

15,01        02If you don't like #ansi for any reason, host your own channel, or 
15,01        02why not make a compo-channel, like 11#everest02, for instance.
15,01        02I've done a couple of logo's in this channel and it's really fun, 
15,01        02believe me.

15,01        02Let's move on, shall we.
15,01        02If everything goes as planned both blend and twilight15 02will 
15,01        02hopefully release around the 15th.
15,01        02My favorite group, for now is blend who has made great packages 
15,01        02this far.
15,01        02At least they're original and comes up with new, never-before-seen- 
15,01        02stuff every time, keep pumpin' dewds.
15,01        02So 9t7 will probably15 02start just fine, after all.

15,01        11phlare02, at the heyboard.. 
15,01        02tjohoo.. (always much to say.)
