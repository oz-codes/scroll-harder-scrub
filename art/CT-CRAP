15,01                                THE PLACE 
15,01                              By Crimethink *

15,01There is a place too pure for us
15,01We cannot enter, but we will try
15,01Those that have, have paid the price
15,01And given their life

15,01The place is maintained and waits for the day
15,01That we will enter and keep it that way
15,01We will see the truth
15,01And have different views
15,01But peace will prevail, and life will go on

15,01For now we are here
15,01But one day we will leave
15,01And enter the place
15,01That owns our dreams
15,01The place remains for us to name

15,01                            SEE OUR WANTS CORRUPT
15,01                               By Crimethink

15,01Some say that they can fix the world
15,01Some say that they can save your soul
15,01Some try and try to make you think
15,01As only they would have it

15,01When they succeed you will then see
15,01When you realize what they have done
15,01All of us are now their clones
15,01We want and want and want

15,01See our wants corrupt the man
15,01That promised us great things ahead
15,01See him fall and tumble
15,01See him fall and perish

15,01We've overthrown and begun anew
15,01And things have got no better
15,01We are now nothing more than leeches
15,01Dead and ripe for the picking

15,01                        
15,01                                DEATH'S DREAM
15,01                                By Crimethink

15,01Death is nearing its time
15,01It'll come and destroy our thoughts
15,01It will come and rape our minds
15,01We will see the dawn of death's rule
15,01We will see a new age born

15,01We won't rebel, won't make a sound
15,01If we do then we will pay
15,01It will force our repent
15,01Then it will make us pay

15,01No, now I am awake
15,01I see it was just a dream
15,01My dream left in the hole
15,01My dream, soon coming true
15,01For I am DEATH and hear my roar
15,01I am DEATH and hear my world

15,01Pain and suffering everywhere
15,01On the edge of conciousness
15,01Feel the heat from the fire
15,01The damned eternal fire

15,01I am DEATH AND HEAR MY ROAR!!!!
15,01I am DEATH AND HEAR MY WORLD!!!!

15,01                     OVER THE HILL AND UNDER THE HILL
15,01                             By Crimethink

15,01I wander alone through the alley
15,01I realize that I am alone
15,01No one to comfort
15,01And no one to hold
