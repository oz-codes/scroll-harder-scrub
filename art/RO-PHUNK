15,01Phunk Palace

15,01Life is depressing and I'm feeling like shit,
15,01Pass me the bong and I'll take just one hit,
15,01A pleasant warmth from my head to my feet,
15,01Its not good enough; bust out with a sheet,
15,01Colors exploding inside of my mind,
15,01Nothing compares this is one of a kind,
15,01Forceful oblivion, enchanting demise,
15,01Awareness drops and my subconscious will rise,
15,01Whirling in Nirvana with my psychadelic dreams,
15,01Float into eternity as I'm ripped at the seams,
15,01But now I'm falling, falling fast,
15,01Knowing it could never last,
15,01My sorrows may return but then,
15,01I'll drop some phunky tabs again.
