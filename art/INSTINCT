15,01     I've spent quite a few days, since being handed this column, trying
15,01to place into words the feelings and motives of TRiBE (Tribe, TRIBE, tRIBE,
15,01TribE, etc). It's been pretty hard to do, probably because at the moment
15,01alot of the "Tribal Feelings" are hard to put into words, let alone a text
15,01file. Oh well. I've never been one to keep my mouth shut, so here comes
15,01something..

15,01     Welcome TRiBE (Tribe, TRIBE, tRIBE, TRibE, etc). This is my view of our
15,01philosophy, as how it stands this month.

15,01     We're TRiBE. We're all experienced, we all have our battle scars. We've
15,01thrown our punches, we've had our battles. We've been backstabbed, we've been
15,01bamboozled. We've had great times, we've had shitty times. We've made our
15,01mark, we've done our job and we've done it well. The "high command" of TRiBE
15,01currently focuses around Cavalier (myself), CyberChrist, and The artist
15,01formerly known as Shihear Kallizad (in no particular order, except my order,
15,01which is nothing in particular.) All of us have had our ups and downs in the
15,01scene, all of us have been in the scene for a minimum of a year and a half.
15,01What am I getting at?

15,01     We're TRiBE. We have no one to answer to except ourselves. We've already
15,01proven, time and time again, that when it comes to getting the job done, we
15,01do it damn well. Each of us, in one way or another, have been parts of some
15,01of the most legendary groups of people ever assembled in the scene. We've
15,01"made our mark" so to speak, and we're damn proud of it. So what does this
15,01mean for TRiBE?

15,01     We're Tribe. We're here to show the scene, which has hit the shitter,
15,01I might add, what "trendsetting" is all about. I figure you take all the
15,01great "old timers" (and those few mutant new timers), the REAL people that
15,01made this scene what it is, get them together and watch the sparks fly. I'm
15,01not promising an ANSI Utopia - Fuck that, it's been promised before. I'm not
15,01promising the ultimate super elite group that will leave all the non members
15,01drooling in their lameness - well, not yet. TRiBE has nothing to prove to
15,01anyone except TRiBE. TRiBE could consist of 5 members by next January, TRiBE
15,01could consist of 500 members by next January, it doesn't matter. TRiBE is
15,01TRiBE, and if you're not TRiBE, screw you, you lose.

15,01     Fuck egos, there are more important places for that. Fuck wars, we've
15,01done them all and done them right. Fuck old group wars or rivalries, there's
15,01no use for them anymore. If you're disgusted by this file, I give a shit. If
15,01you're disgusted by the ideas I'm proposing, the methods I'm using, the shock
15,01technique you might think I'm employing, delete this and every other TRiBE
15,01file you see. That's the difference. This is the new TRiBE. If you don't care
15,01about us, well Merry Christmas because we don't give a shit about you, either.
15,01*SMOOCH*. We answer to no one but ourselves.

15,01     If you're not in TRiBE, screw you, you lose, slick. Maybe I should
15,01trademark that phrase. I can't express it any other way. We're TRiBE. Any
15,01member of TRiBE can walk into a congegration of "elite dudes", say "Yo, I'm
15,01TRiBE" - and *NOTHING* else matters. We don't have to run around screaming
15,01and warring and playing little "group wars" because WE'RE THE BEST. God.
15,01That sounds like such a fucking egotistical statement, but it's TRUE.
15,01Everyone here in TRiBE, everyone who's going to be in TRiBE, is saying "I've
15,01made my mark. I'm in TRiBE now. Whatever I release is fantastic because I'm
15,01TRiBE and nothing else matters." There's not a single piece of work that's
15,01released or will be released, that a TRiBESMAN can look down upon. Our pack
15,01is quality, our pack has one thing people lack, pride. TRiBE PRiDE. If you
15,01don't believe in your group or love the people you're working with, what the
15,01fuck are you doing there? We're having a blast. We're kicking ass, we're
15,01taking names, we're TRiBE.
