15,01"Hit me", said the little Coyote.

15,01So I hit him.

15,01He screamed in pain and torture, and I felt so sorry for him.  I should not
15,01have caused him such grief.

15,01So I hit him again.

15,01Then he cussed at me, and I realized his childhood had been frought with the
15,01insanities of vegetable abuse and his father and spraypainted the walls of his
15,01bedroom with Drain-O.

15,01And the depths of my horror and hatred for the cruelty of the world overwhelmed
15,01me, and I hit him again.

15,01The little Coyote stood and flipped me the universal sign of love, then
15,01traipsed off.

15,01And I felt I understood him better.
