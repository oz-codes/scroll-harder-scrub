15,01- Screaming Soul -


15,01Child within your womb - unborn;
15,01From its mother, forever torn -
15,01Screaming fetus in a darkened street -
15,01Silent cries suffer in the summer heat.
15,01Death comes softly to take us down,
15,01But not until our lives are at their end;
15,01Death before life is a paradox
15,01That haunts me like a shadowfriend.
15,01Hear me mother?  Hear your baby cry?
15,01By your ignorance, a child has died.
15,01Damned legalities allow this hell to persist -
15,01Baby only wants to know that now she's missed.
15,01Do you love her now, after the fact,
15,01Even though there's no turning back?
15,01She cries softly in your dreams -
15,01Sometimes, almost real she seems.
15,01The mask burns; the hidden pain -
15,01Heart won't let you deny her again;
15,01Tender hands and tender feet -
15,01All thrown away like rancid meat.
15,01Don't you suffer regrets. . . feel some lament?
15,01By your hand, one soul is rent!
15,01Innocent baby, innocent life;
15,01Now 6 feet under, like a sacrifice.
15,01Damn it all, you inhuman beast;
15,01Your soul is devilspawn in the least!
15,01Fall upon your face with your brow upon your knee,
15,01And pray with all your faith that you can change your destiny!
15,01How can you live with your past -
15,01Even hiding behind your mask?
15,01Masks won't always last forever,
15,01Soon you'll have to find some new endeavor;
15,01Some new place to put your soul,
15,01Some new cave, some hidden hole. . .
15,01Some place where your fears can't haunt you -
15,01Place where your demons can't taunt you;
15,01But reality will change your fate -
15,01There's no place where your sin can't wait.
15,01Your past stands like an open window,
15,01Screaming louder than a thousand innuendoes.
15,01Little fiends forever surround,
15,01Dragging your heart beneath the ground -
15,01Not fiends in truth, but merely fate,
15,01Dragging you to the inferno gates;
15,01All they want is your remission,
15,01Penance for your devil's submission.
15,01In your heart, a homicidalist;
15,01Name at the top ot the killer list.
15,01Innocent death was your only goal -
15,01Buried fetus, screaming soul!
15,01Memories haunt you for all time:
15,01Killer in action - Killer in mind.
