15,01Unity is Coming

15,01        A new battle is coming down. If humanity does not act fast mankind
15,01will find himself out of the picture quicker than previously expected. We
15,01are a rightous race. We are proud. Those are our weaknesses. We will
15,01pass bye like all other dominant species before us.

15,01        The Earth is thought to be a few billion years old. After the first
15,01billion, life began to flourish all over our green world. Through the
15,01process of evolution, the giant lizards, dinosaurs, became the dominant
15,01species. They were dominant for over a million years, until some freak
15,01circumstance of fate, which science hasn't been able to fully explain to
15,01this date, caused them die out. Underneath the rubble, of the lizard kings,
15,01crawled little brown mice like animals. These animals are humanity's
15,01ancestors. Evolution came. 

15,01        Four to five million years ago humans finally evolved from apes.
15,01Different lineages of our evolution, who were not able to adapt or evolve,
15,01died out. Current day mankind (Homo sapiens) evolved from Homo erectus.
15,01All the other different ancient humans died out. We were the strongest,
15,01and now we remain dominant.

15,01        I ask the age old question, "How much longer will mankind remain
15,01dominant, or will he simply die out?" The Earth is a few billion years
15,01old, we have only been in the picture for the last four to five million
15,01(not even one half of a billion). Cro-Magnon man, Homo erectus,
15,01Australopithecus, and many other groups of evolving humans died out, and
15,01some of them existed for far longer than modern day civilization.
15,01In this light, evolution came, but because human beings were not entirely
15,01capable of reason, unity was lost. Thus they were prayed upon by bigger
15,01and stronger animals, and they, like the best, died out. Evolution came.

15,01        Here we stand. In the words of Fredrich Nietzsche, "Mankind is
15,01but a tightrope suspended between beast and uberman." ("Also Sprach 
15,01Zarathustra") Evolution is coming. If we as a society, as a race, as
15,01a people are to survive we must learn unity. No more seperation. No more
15,01fighting. No more wars. Unity speaks our driving force, no longer is it
15,01necessary to rely totally upon the individual, there are some things
15,01individuals cannot accomplish. All these wars will lead us no where,
15,01but to the pits of evolution. We will pass on. Mankind will be snuffed
15,01out not with a bang, but with a flicker.

15,01        This applies to all things in life. In a war no one wins. Unity
15,01will come, and those who oppose it's driving force will fall by the
15,01wayside, they have no choice. I call for the reader to take up a voice
15,01with me, and scream "Unity!" before it is too late. Humanity will never
15,01survive as a race without it. Humanity must learn to accept it.
