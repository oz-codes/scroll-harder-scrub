15,01- Paradox Death -


15,01In the dry-caked, oozing ground,
15,01The blood of all lost time is bound.
15,01When we die, we rip our skin,
15,01And the devil's sin sets in.

15,01Hollow sound within our veins
15,01As our blood cries out in pain;
15,01Scimitar blade in your throat -
15,01Chanting, dancing 'round the goat.

15,01Satan's lies fill your head -
15,01Hell spawned ritual that's devil bred.
15,01Cough as burning blood red smoke
15,01Burns your eyes, as you choke.

15,01Like a leper, your flesh decays -
15,01Falling off as the drummer plays;
15,01Chanting sound as your spirit dies -
15,01Sell your heart for pagan lies.

15,01Damning fire falls around you;
15,01Hellstone torching all your boundaries.
15,01Feel the total, writhing agony -
15,01Fire brings you to your knee.

15,01Writhing twitch - screaming death -
15,01Acrid stench fills your breath;
15,01Lungs burst as your windpipe snaps,
15,01Broken as your strength is sapped.

15,01Devil grabs you by the throat -
15,01Guts your insides, and then gloats.
15,01He stares at you as he laughs -
15,01Burns you with his Baal craft.

15,01Witch's brew within the pit
15,01Steals your heart as you submit.
15,01In the cauldron, your red blood boils -
15,01Shattered heart drips on the soil.

15,01All that's left of your immortal soul
15,01Is the pain that hell controls.
15,01Too dazed to move - painful stasis -
15,01Paradox death - Devil's Heaven oasis.
