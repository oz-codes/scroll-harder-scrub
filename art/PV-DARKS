04,01A man 13walks q00uietly in the night,
04,01aware 13if a da00rk shadow fallowing him from behind.
04,01The m13an shive00rs from cold fear.
04,01The h13oweling 00wind and rustling branches carote his mental integrity.
04,01The m13ans para00noia is distorting the images from his mind.
04,01His p13aranoia 00is overpowering his mind.
04,01Sanit13y is twi00sting.
04,01Gruso13me pictu00res flash vividly and quickly as he glances back only
04,01to se13e only h00is shadow.
04,01He pa13nics, an00d runs in vain for his shadow is still fallowing close behind.
04,01Almos13t psycot00icly he jumps over a bridge to get away from the shadow.
04,01He su13ddenly g00asps to see that the shadow is waiting for him on the surface of
04,01the w13ater.
04,01Splas13h! He hi00ts the water like a lead ball.
04,01In th13e mans l00ast second among the living he sees the shadows eyes glow a deep
04,01red a13nd its p00erverted, evil grin almost laughing at him.
04,01The m13an slowl00y drowns in the murky water... still in fear of the shadow.
04,01The s13hadow fe00asts on his soul and once again romes freely to kill another.
