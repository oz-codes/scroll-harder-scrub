15,01In depression

15,01I sit back
15,01As the winds of depression blow me across
15,01    the land and into the never.
15,01All the follies in passing...
15,01Have surmounted to the forecoming dread,
15,01In life as it is in death,
15,01Kill my being, strike the Achille's heel-

15,01The leaves are scraping against the pavement,
15,01And in the voices that they make...
15,01I have a feeling that everything will
15,01    turn out alright,
15,01But as I look towards those dark skies,
15,01The end seems so near...
15,01With a gun in my mouth, and bullets for words,
15,01Nothing sounds so dear.

15,01Yes... there is this fear,
15,01That life will continue on...
15,01Living in a self exiled hell,
15,01Victim to the lost souls,
15,01The winds of darkness
15,01In depression-


15,01                                  Mister E. [CiA]
