15,01Their cheeks were fresh and tender,
15,01perhaps kissed for the first time,
15,01Seen from behind, as they turned 
15,01to rejoin their tender group, they looked older,
15,01coats over light trousers. Their poverty
15,01ignores the winter's cold. Slightly bowlegged...
15,01collars ragged...like their older brothers,
15,01already discredited citizens. For a few more years
15,01they won't have a price, and nothing can humiliate
15,01those unable to judge themselves. Though they do it
15,01with so much incredible spontineity, they're offering themselves to life,
15,01and life in turn needs them. They're so ready for it!
15,01They return the kisses, savoring the novelty.
15,01Then they go, as imperturbably as when they came.
15,01But since they're still confident of that life that
15,01cherishes them, they make sincere promises, plan a promising future
15,01if it ever took place--but they? Tell them; they're ready,
15,01as one man, as they embrace and kiss,
15,01with the same aroma in their cheeks.
15,01But it won't be their trust in the world that triumphs.
15,01That the world will have to overlook.

15,01                        --Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1969
15,01  Pasolini was an Italian poet and film maker, born in Bologna in 1922, 
15,01killed in 1975. He was a member of the Communist Party until he was kicked
15,01out because it was discovered that he was gay. He remained a Communist until
15,01his death, which, ironically, was at the hands of a group of young boys he
15,01had been trying to pick up. He was a questionable type of guy, but a hell of
15,01a poet, and you can pick up some of his films at Blockbuster or other vid 
15,01stores if they carry foreign stuff. The films are: The Gospel According to 
15,01Saint Mattheiw, Hawks and Sparrows, Oedipus Rex, Teorema, Porcile, Medea, 
15,01and The Canterbury Tales. There may be others, but I don't know. Check out
15,01The Canterbury Tales, but don't watch it with your Mom, and if you don't 
15,01speak Italian, be ready to do some fast reading :)
