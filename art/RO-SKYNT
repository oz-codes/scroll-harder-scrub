15,01Skynet

15,01Diplomacy fails as aggression increases,
15,01Foreign policy crumbling into bits and pieces,
15,01Aggression is growing like a tumor unchecked,
15,01As the first missile is launched the future is wrecked,
15,01For less than a week the missiles rained down,
15,01When they searched for new targets nothing was found,
15,01As nuclear winter encompasses all,
15,01Mankind is eradicated as civilization falls,
15,01The war was fought for wealth and not need,
15,01For the folly of man is great indeed.
