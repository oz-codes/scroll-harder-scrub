15,01Starving... Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01The child out in the street,
15,01no longer has the will to go on,
15,01the food in his stomach,
15,01the love in his heart,
15,01the child is starving.

15,01Impaled onto a wall of frustration,
15,01the child has met his future.
15,01Laying down, passing out,
15,01with no joyous outlook,
15,01knowing that his starvation,
15,01will be his demise.

15,01Days pass onto weeks,
15,01weeks pass onto months,
15,01he does not see into the new year.
15,01With a miniscule smine,
15,01the child hungers no more.
