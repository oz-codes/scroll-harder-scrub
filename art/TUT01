00,01        okie.. this is my installment or you could say tutorial. i had someone  
15,01        00ask how to make the letter 'k'. i've realized that this letter gives
15,01        00many people problems. i'll will go though one step at a time at how
15,01        00i make a standard 'k'. 

00,01Step One: make something you can work with.

00,01a simple rectangle will work15            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
00,01just something so you know the size15     $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
00,01of the letter you want and the width.15   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
00,01i've learned that once i have something15 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
00,01to work with, then i can picture what15   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
00,01i want it to look like15                  $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
15,01                                        $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

00,01Step Two: work with what you have.

00,01this is where you actually make an 15     $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
00,01outline of what the letter will look15    $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
00,01like. it doesn't have to look perfect15   $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
00,01but just make a generalization of15       $$$$$$$$$$ggggg 
00,01what it should look like.. very rough15   $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
15,01                                        $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
15,01                                        $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$

00,01Step Three: alter the apperance to what you want it to look like.

00,01this is where you actually give the15      ,a%&$F $$$%a,
00,01letter some personality, your own  15     $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
00,01touch. you can round it off or15          $$$$$$$ $$$F'~ 
00,01give it a twixt and make it funky,15      $$$$$$$$$$%a,. 
15,01                                        $$$$$$$ $$$$$$b
15,01                                        $$$$$$$ $$$$$$$
15,01                                        F'"~       ~"'7

00,01Step Four: color it/shade it to however you want.

00,01this is where you let your15              10 ,a11%10&$F $;$%a,
00,01creativity loose and do    15   00...15       11$10l;;;;$ ;;$i00::::::
00,01whatever you want..15              00:15      11$$ll10;i; $iiF'~ 
00,01the experimental stage.15          00.;;;15   02i12,11$11,01$iu10iiii%%02a,12.10 
00,01use you imagination and come up15      10.15  02iiiii11$$12 10ii02i11i12$$b15     00;
00,01with your own what to do things.15     12gg15 12gggg02$$12$ 02gg12g$11$$$12   00..;
00,01there are many ways to make 15            11F12'"~       ~"'7
