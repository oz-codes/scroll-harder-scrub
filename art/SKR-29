15,01Skrubly's Entry for Blender 29

15,01The words are..:

15,01encyclopedia salesman/rocking & rolling/goth party


15,01        It was a pretty normal day, overall, which if you didn't know is        

15,01a literary technique called "foreshadowing" which basically mean that 
15,01shit's going to get really fucked up later in the story.  It's something I
15,01picked up from reading Bloom County whilst perched upon the holy throne of
15,01black-beans-and-mexi-melt penance.  But enough about how I spent last 
15,01weekend, on with the story.

15,01        So, like I was saying, it was a pretty normal day. A day that would
15,01typically end up with me sleeping upside down in my own closet with nothing
15,01on but a poorly placed washcloth and a bottle of tequila in my hand. Typical
15,01day, you know.

15,01        I've got this new gig going on right now. My roomate, Marty, got me 
15,01into it.  It's called a multi-level direct marketing endevour.  In normal 
15,01english, it means I sell stuff door to door. You know, can I come in and soil
15,01your carpet and clean it up with this new vacuum type stuff. (I've walked 
15,01into people's houses before and soiled their carpets, but I never had the
15,01excuse that I was a vacuum salesman or something..) What I sell, though, is
15,01encyclopedias. Real fucking original, I know. Why don't I just go door to
15,01door, fling myself on the ground, and scream "GO OUT AND BY A GODDAMN CDROM
15,01FOR SIXTY DOLLARS INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO MY PREFABRICATED SALES DRIVEL!",
15,01you're asking? Well, because I work on comission and I'm sick of eating
15,01Tina's burritos three meals a day. Anyways, Marty said it would be easy 
15,01money and Marty hasn't done anything that required actual WORK since 1982.

15,01        I've dogged all of the people in my neighborhood to death about this,
15,01and since I live in a neighborhood that on a whole has an income equivalent
15,01to one week at a quik-e-mart, no one can really afford a set of 3000 dollar
15,01encyclopedias. So I set out to find greener pastures, and hopefully total
15,01rich idiots that actually want paper encyclopedias instead of that new 
15,01fangled computer stuff. 

15,01        My destination: Greenwood Estates. Possibly one of the most posh,
15,01upperclass districts in my entire town.  Their toolsheds are the size of my
15,01house. Their driveways are also longer than my street, which makes for 
15,01pretty tiring work, especially when you're lugging around a bunch of damn
15,01books.

15,01        The first house looked like a pretty good prospect, at first. Medium
15,01sized driveway, no nasty dogs, manicured gardens (they can afford a gardner),
15,01a lexus in the garage.. yea, this is it. 

15,01        Ding-dong, the door opens , and I prepare to toady up to whoever the 
15,01hell owns the place and has a full checking account.

15,01        At first I wonder if I've actually contacted alien life, because this
15,01guy is possibly the palest thing I've ever seen. You can practically see his
15,01heart beating through his white dress shirt. The only thing that prevents you
15,01is the pocket protector that seems to be outfitted with every single kind
15,01of screwdriver known to mankind (and, well, maybe not even mankind. I told
15,01you, the guy looks like a goddamn alien) But what really takes the cake is
15,01what's behind him: what looks like the external case to an IBM 360 mainframe,
15,01but is filled with all sorts of weird rack-mounted computer crap.  And what
15,01looks like a DEC mini humming quietly next to it with a 30 disk cdrom 
15,01changer sitting on top.

15,01        At that point, the cyber-tool guy that owns the place speaks:

15,01        "What are you selling?"

15,01        "Nothing, man, nothing."

15,01        "No, really."

15,01        I shrug. "Encyclopedias."

15,01        The guy squints through his glasses at me, then at the books, and
15,01        then back to me. 

15,01        "I'll buy them."
