15,01bitch
15,01cunt
15,01whore
15,01you lied to me
15,01you lied to your best friend
15,01but
15,01most importantly
15,01you lied to yourself.

15,01you did it again
15,01you fooled yourself
15,01you hurt yourself
15,01and a lot of the people close to you-
15,01again.
15,01but never again.

15,01can't you see
15,01you've been fooling yourself
15,01people actually despise you
15,01we can't stand to be near you
15,01it's one big fuckin' facade
15,01one big lie
15,01because you lied to us
15,01first, second, and every time after that.

15,01time and time again
15,01you fake it
15,01and try to pretend
15,01that everything's ok
15,01when you know deep in your heart
15,01that it just isn't right
15,01or better
15,01or even somewhat-reasonably-fine.
