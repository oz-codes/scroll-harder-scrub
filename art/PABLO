15,01        1. Save your files frequently
15,01        2. When saving your files use the BIN format as there is less room

15,01           Since pages are swapped to disk the current page gets saved
15,01           before it is swapped to memory.  The files are saved as PABLO.VPx
15,01           where x is the page #.  If Pablo crashes chances are the .VPx
15,01           files are intact, just rename the files so they don't get over-
15,01           written and the reload them with Pablo.  Pablo will recognize the
15,01           .VPx format.  Make sure you set the column size first.
