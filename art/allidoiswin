All I do is win win win no matter what
Got money on mind, I can never get enough
and every time I step up in the building
everybody hands go up
and they stay there
and they stay there
and they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'cause all I do is win win win
and if you goinâ€™ in put your hands in the air
make 'em stay there
