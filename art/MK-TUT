15,01A few years ago I was playing around in a post on Huma and all of a sudden
15,01drew a shading tutorial online.  That was the only tutorial I ever drew and
15,01I was happy with it because after 2 weeks it fluttered out of existance.

15,01I love tutorials.  Perhaps more than the resulting pictures themselves.
15,01They add a third dimension to a piece of artwork: time.  After viewing an
15,01oldschool tutorial recently, I decided to recreate the newschool tutorial
15,01I drew so long ago.

15,01In case you can't tell from the outline, this is a sphere sitting on a
15,01plane.  It's casting a shadow to the right.  I keep the outline simple,
15,01it isn't important if the lines connect or not, they're only there to
15,01make sure the basic shape looks good.  I spent about 2 minutes drawing
15,01this outline.  About 30 seconds of that was adding the plane and the
15,01shadow as an afterthought.  For complex objects this may take quite some
15,01time, and when you're done, you'll be disappointed at how much time you
15,01spent making something that looks so bad.  Don't be frustrated, the
15,01shading is the most important thing... it's unfortunate so many artists
15,01overlook it, or toss it in as an afterthought.

15,01I start from the darkest shade and work up to the brightest shade.  This
15,01"lightening" approach is very similar to drawing with a pencil.  I also draw
15,01over the outline as the contrast builds.  This should take a little longer
15,01than the outline did, depending on what you have to shade.  For complex
15,01objects, you're busy casting shadows everywhere and making the background
15,01dark.  If you make the background too bright, the foreground won't stand
15,01out at all.
