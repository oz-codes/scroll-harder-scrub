15,01    Well, welcome to the first packet from GRiND. I hope you enjoyed looking
15,01at our first attempt at a packet. Yes, it's rather small, but I felt that this
15,01month was a good time as any to start releasing packets. GRiND as a whole does
15,01ANSi, VGA (in GiF & JPG formats), .MODS, and we are currently looking artists
15,01of all kinds.

15,01    GRiND began around June of 1994 when I was fed up with a lot of ansi
15,01groups. I tried in vain to get into a few groups (I'll name no names because
15,01I don't want to start fights here), and I got extremely pissed off. I felt
15,01that the artwork that a few others and I were doing was good enough to be
15,01released in a group somewhere, so I started my own. It has taken (me) this
15,01long to finally release our first packet because there really aren't that
15,01many artists in my area code. The purpose of GRiND is just to have some fun
15,01for us, and maybe a little recognition for our work.

15,01    Hopefully, the group can release packets at a bi-monthly pace. We are just
15,01totally strapped for artists. If you are interested in joining the group, you
15,01need to get a hold of me. If you can draw, CONTACT US!

15,01    So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to my dark world of blood and violence.
15,01We've worked many long hours bringing this to you, so I hope we can give you
15,01a few minutes of enjoyment. Remember, this IS our first packet, so don't take
15,01us too critically, okay?
