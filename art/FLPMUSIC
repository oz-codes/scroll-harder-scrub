15,011.  All material must be turned in by the second to last
15,01        week of the month. You can turn things in early,
15,01        (the earlier the better) but we will not accept
15,01        anything past the second to last week of the
15,01        month. All late material will simply be added
15,01        to the following month's pack.

15,012.  During the time between deadline and release, a 
15,01        process called "quality check" will occur, in 
15,01        which your material will be reviewed for release.  
15,01        In the past, FLiP has been very lienient on it's
15,01        music department, and FLiP has earned a 
15,01        reputation for poorly written music. FLiP is
15,01        still a layed back and uncompetitive group, yet
15,01        it would help to raise our standards so that 
15,01        more people will want to download.

15,013.  Please try to sign any songs in the sample text area
15,01        with your handle and 'FLiP'. 
15,01  
15,014.  Any sign of 'ripped' songs (unless a specified remake)
15,01        will result in termination from the group.
15,01        
15,015.  Make sure to keep in contact with a the music 
15,01        coordinator, CTS (chrisw@freenet.scri.fsu.edu), at 
15,01        least once a month.  You are expected to at least 
15,01        submit something to the group every month, even 
15,01        though it may be incomplete and/or won't make it 
15,01        into the pack. If you are unable to submit anything
15,01        please Email CTS. Failure to do so will be cause 
15,01        for removing you off the memberlist due to 'lack 
15,01        of communication.'

15,016.  Try to keep things as innovative as you can.  This 
15,01        includes making your own samples when possible,
15,01        deviating from your usual style, and useing
15,01        a veriaty of instruments. 

15,017.  If you are asked by a FLiP member to help them on a
15,01        project, (Demo, Intro, Loader, Musical Duet, etc)
15,01        please cooperate and help in any way that you
15,01        can.

15,018.  Please include an ID file such as a file_id.diz to 
15,01        identify your song with. However, I recoment 
15,01        useing a file name such as '(filename).nfo'
15,01        (example: 'cs-song.nfo') This prevent's
15,01        your ID file from being overwritten by other
15,01        people's. The ID file should include:
15,01         A. Your Handle
15,01         B. FLiP Productions
15,01         C. Title Of Song
15,01         D. Style Of Music
15,01         E. Any Other Information You Wish To Include

15,019.  You are free to name your uncompressed file anything 
15,01        you wish but your compressed zipfile must be named
15,01        as follows, since it allows for easier organization:
15,01        (we're using the dos limitations of 8 characters 
15,01        dot 3 character extension)
15,01        1) all filenames start with 'flp-'
15,01        2) the next 2 characters is an abbreviation of your 
15,01           handle, for example, Gizmo is GZ
15,01        3) the last two characters is the number of your 
15,01           release that year. For example,if it's your first 
15,01           song it'll be '01' so the song above will be 
15,01           named: FLP-GZ01.ZIP

15,0110.  Most of all have fun!!!
