15,01Time... - Frost Byte <CiA LiT SS>

15,01I feel that time has fone too slow for me.
15,01I think that I am ahead of my time,
15,01advanced in ways that some will never be.
15,01Powerless, without reason or rhyme.

15,01I am the only me, special without a doubt,
15,01locked away in my cage,
15,01pacing aimlessly about.
15,01Had back by society because of my age.

15,01I am the straw that broke the camels back,
15,01the thorn in the persons side,
15,01held back for things that I "lack,"
15,01the fools can't see me inside.

15,01Teenages are judged by people from looking from afar,
15,01by false pretentions and lies,
15,01not of who we really are.
15,01Without them, we could reach the skies.
