00,01 Whatever happened to your freespirit,
00,01was it stole from you at birth?
00,01 Taught by this world's fine ways to suppress it
00,01trade it off for security for all your worth

00,01 I see my childhood friends all grow up
00,01like everyone else, always the status quo
00,01 A house, a spouse, and a car, the american dream
00,01what has the world beyond this, they'll never know

00,01 From birth to death we lead a life of greedy consumption
00,01  focusing our energies on human production
00,01 Well I'd have to think it was our only fucking function
00,01  because there's got to be more to life than reproduction

00,01 We surround ourselves with the security of possessions
00,01  they blanket us as years drag on
00,01 Yet slowly, the years become an illusion
00,01  a life of regrets, over things never done...
