15,01This is part of a song I wrote for the Shards
15,01It was originally called Thumbtacks

15,01Bitting down, releasing his anger,
15,01letting it out, by killing a stranger.
15,01Warm red blood, drowning his pain,
15,01visible to all he cant hide the stain.

15,01He was strapped down, there was no where
15,01to run, the lights whent out, the sound
15,01or a gun, He never came out. No one knew
15,01he was there, nobody came to his rescue,
15,01because nobody cared.

15,01Slitting his wrists, feeling the pain,
15,01nothing to lose. Nothing to gain.
15,01His lifeless carcass, on the ground,
15,01eternal damnation was all he'd found.

15,01He pulls a razor across his skin,
15,01bleeding his sorrow, showing his sin.
15,01Bloody letters on his flesh,
15,01it doesnt hurt, he couldnt care less
15,01Losing blood, falling asleep,
15,01dying slowly...he dug too deep
