15,01    I close my eyes, and hear the blood flowing in my ears.
15,01    I open my mind, and let it wander through the years.
15,01    I hook on familiar territory.
15,01    Her face, her eyes, the sound of her laughter.
15,01    Sweet memories, flashing by.
15,01    I open my eyes, and the room seems filled with smoke.
15,01    Through it all I see the gleam of a smiling mouth.

15,01    again, her face, her eyes, her laughter.

15,01    My sorrow.
15,01         Is she still here?
15,01              What do I know?

15,01    I close my eyes, and hear the blood flowing in my ears.
15,01    I close my mind, and forget the passage of years.
15,01    I look on unfamiliar territory.
15,01    No face, no eyes, no sound of sweet laughter.
15,01    To sweet memories I say goodbye.
15,01    I open my eyes, and the room seems filled with smoke.
15,01    In it all, I see...

15,01                   Nothing.

15,01    So I fill the room with smoke.
15,01    I cloud my mind.
15,01    I see the glint of a smiling face.
15,01    Here I will stay.
