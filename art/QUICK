15,01  COMMENTS: Listen to it with Scream Tracker v3.01 or Iplay if you can
15,01            disable the Stereo.. (can you?)  DMP works but sounds bad at
15,01            certain parts.

15,01        This track was created in about half an hour while waiting for a
15,01phone call.  It's very happy and bouncy (as the type indicates) and I pretty
15,01much just wrote it to sicken myself.  I'm more amused with it than I am happy
15,01with it.  But it's small, so stop complaining.  And get a haircut.

15,01        Greets to my dying stereo which I have another tape deck hooked up to
15,01which likes to stop in the middle of playing a tape and gnash it around
15,01happily forcing me to dive across the room to stop it from destroying
15,01anything.

15,01        Greets also to my dead TV which happened to die as soon as I managed
15,01to get money so that I had to spend it all on a new TV.  Hello's to my dying
15,01headphone extension cord, my broken Pagedown key which is a more annoying loss
15,01than I originally thought it would be.  Greets to the phone that exploded
15,01during an electrical storm, the phone that died which I had to take back a
15,01couple months ago that made me lock my keys in my car and miss a very
15,01important engagement.

15,01        Hi to the papercut on my finger which I got last night while looking
15,01through papers.  Hello to my alarm clock which goes off whenever the hell it
15,01feels like it.  Hello to my answering machine which has a long 20 second
15,01message I can never seem to fill.  Oh, and hi to my 5 1/4" drive which no
15,01longer works making my copy of Stunts unreachable.

15,01Anyhow.
