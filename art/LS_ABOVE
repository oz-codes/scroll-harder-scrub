15,01Above The Clouds

15,01After much delay I reached the gates
15,01But St. Peter was not there to greet me
15,01A single tear rolled down my cheek
15,01As I headed back down through the clouds
15,01But unlike the past, things still worked out
15,01For an angel was sent down for me
15,01With this angel I rose high above the clouds
15,01Together we soared through the skies
15,01Like all good things this voyage did end
15,01But I left with new feelings in my heart
15,01And stronger convictions than before
15,01And now I know that when I am with the angel
15,01There is absolutely nothing that can bring me down
