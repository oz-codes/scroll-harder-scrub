15,01On the passing of wealth

15,01A cold and sharp December dusk it came
15,01descending from the sky like silvered dust;
15,01descending from the sky like argent rain.
15,01It fell upon the land with measured lust.

15,01So slowly, steady, calm, controlled and sure
15,01the hail fell.  Imagine our surprise
15,01to find that it was formed of metal pure
15,01and precious!  We could not believe our eyes.

15,01The morning next we danced among the drifts
15,01and frolicked in the dry metallic snow.
15,01We blessed the sky and prayed for more such gifts.

15,01The clouds above felt took for granted, so
15,01a spear of gold emerged then, sharp and bright.
15,01It melted up the snow before our sight.
