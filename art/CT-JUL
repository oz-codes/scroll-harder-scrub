15,01One more fatality within the war
15,01of adulthood and all its trappings fair.
15,01A broken girl on both sides of the door;
15,01I let you go to show you that I care.

15,01I let you go so you aren't torn apart,
15,01still but an infant; Solomon I'm not.
15,01Your dual stage confounded mind and heart
15,01but age and youth as well; the things you sought.

15,01Reborn too premature, your adult needs
15,01outweigh a child's good concerns and fears.
15,01Your crazy flower blooms still from its seeds.

15,01You know a melancholy past your years;
15,01Just on the verge between two worlds, your mind
15,01set off and left your heart and flesh behind.
