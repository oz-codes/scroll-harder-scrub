15,01          00Thoughts running rapid
15,01          00through the disjointed corridors of reason,
15,01          00each only part of a greater whole, humbling themselves
15,01          00in the eyes of creation.

15,01          00Through the disjointed corridors of reason
15,01          00the sweet melodies of chaos ring.
15,01          00In the eyes of creation
15,01          00time becomes an embittered child.

15,01          00The sweet melodies of chaos ring,
15,01          00death ambles through the doorway.
15,01          00Time becomes an embittered child,
15,01          00as essence is shoved through the threshold.

15,01          00Death ambles through the doorway
15,01          00casting long shadows upon the living
15,01          00As essence is shoved through the threshold
15,01          00screaming in protest.

15,01          00Casting long shadows upon the living,
15,01          00the sun mounts it's golden throne.
15,01          00Screaming in protest
15,01          00Luna cowers behind a shroud of mist.

15,01          00The sun mounts it's golden throne,
15,01          00Shaman's gather to pay hommage to their spirit totems.
15,01          00Luna cowers behind a shroud of mist
15,01          00as the shadows proclaim the name of their hero, twighlight fades.

15,01          00Shamans gather and pay homage to their spirit totems,
15,01          00each only part of a greater whole, humbling themselves,
15,01          00as the shadows proclaim the name of their hero, twighlight fades...
