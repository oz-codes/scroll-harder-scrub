15,01  What we Are:

15,01       ACiD is a new ANSi artists group. For a long time, there
15,01  have been various groups that have specialized in ANSi art. But
15,01  now, the best artists from these groups have come together to
15,01  form the ultimate ANSi artists group - the "ANSi elite" if you
15,01  will. These guys from around the world are here for a few basic
15,01  reasons. More about this later.

15,01  Where we came from:

15,01       Many of you have heard of an old group called A.A.A. In
15,01  fact, many of you have probably seen some of their work. With the
15,01  exception of some PD chick named Ebony Eyes, A.A.A. has produced
15,01  the most incredible ansis ever seen to the ANSi emulated eye. Led
15,01  by such awesome artists as RaD Man, Chips Ahoy, The Beholder,
15,01  Icepirate, Grimm, and Shadow Demon, A.A.A. proved to the world
15,01  that they could make ansis. And we have included a few of these
15,01  ansis in here to demonstrate the quality of time and effort put
15,01  into every ANSi by every member of A.A.A. Regardless, ACiD
15,01  directly descended from A.A.A. Due to some internal turmoil and
15,01  flack by some previous A.A.A. SysOps, the group has retained
15,01  many of its members and is now re-assembled flying under the
15,01  ACiD banner.

15,01  What we do:

15,01       ACiD is plain and simple an ANSI artists group. We don't
15,01  claim to ever release any games, or other such nonsense, that is
15,01  reserved for groups such as INC. What we are here to do is make
15,01  ANSi's. One of our artists will create several different kinds of
15,01  ANSi's for your pleasure, or for the pleasure of your users. The
15,01  types of ANSis that we will create are:

15,01         1) BBS Advertisements
15,01                   -By FAR the most popular. Our artists get TONS
15,01                    of requests for these. Please continue reading
15,01                    to find out how you can get one made for you!
15,01          2) BBS Logon Screens
15,01                   -This includes welcome ANSi's and Matrix ANSi's
15,01          3) General BBS ANSi's
15,01                   -Most MS*DOS based BBS's basically live and die
15,01                    with their ANSi's and there are many different
15,01                    kinds required. 


15,01       There are also other kinds of ANSi's that people request.
15,01  All of these requests will be considered.

15,01  How to ask for YOUR ANSi:

15,01       ACiD members are sick of getting email about how some dude
15,01  wants an ANSi made for his BBS, etc.. If you want an ANSi made
15,01  from the world's finest ANSi artists, then there are quite a few
15,01  places to ask:

15,01       1) Any ACiD BBS, [IN THE ACID ANSI REQUEST MESSAGE SUB!].

15,01               a) 911 is a JoKE
15,01               b) X-T-C Systems

15,01       2) Any Celerity BBS which carries the ACiDNET Message Sub.

15,01       What you need to do is post what the name of the board is,
15,01  what your ANSi request is, and any pertinent information that you
15,01  would think your ANSi artist is. Please specify which artist you
15,01  would like your ANSi made by. Every effort to make the best ANSi
15,01  for you will be made.
