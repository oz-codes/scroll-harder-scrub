15,01                    14I'm on the edge...I'm on the brink.
15,01                  14It's the end of the line, my number is up.
15,01                    14My soul is gone, I've emptied my cup.
15,01                   14I need to let go, I need to give up.
15,01        02 15           14But I can not the pain is too much.
15,01                  14My toughts are ramblings, mere journals
15,01                14   of madness, there is no hope. Nothing
15,01                   14but saddness. Mabe I'm just out of it.

15,01                14  15    14lost, but I don't really care.
