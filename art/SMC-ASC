15,01COMPLIMENTS OF THE UGLY CLUB...
15,01-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15,01...It's another Almost-Real-World post, this time slightly out of reality
15,01since its being distributed in a pack that people are bound to actually read
15,01instead of an Ugly Club pack like usual. For more information concerning the
15,01Ugly Club and all related mass-movements, see below the main text.

15,01But back to the here and now: This post comes straight from Discordia, a
15,01board that gets most of the flow north of Seattle. The topic of this post
15,01was based on a discussion of Disney's frighteningly overcool hit HACKERS,
15,01and how 31337 we thought it was. No, not really. But that chick in it was
15,01REALLY hot, wasn't she? I don't know about you, but i'd sure like to feel
15,01her boobies, if you know what i mean. That is, i wouldn't mind sticking my

15,01REAL HACKERS: a movie

15,01Scene 1: fade up title/credits, light techno in background, followed by the
15,01  sound of rapid, erratic typing. fade up into a messy room, pitch black
15,01  except for the warm glow of a computer monitor's warming glow on the face
15,01  a pasty-skinned geek and his immediate surroundings, which consists of
15,01  a large pile of books on the floor, a number of punk/techno/sorayama
15,01  posters on the wall, and several hundred pop cans on the desk.

15,01   (The sound of a door opening offscreen, light pours into the room)

15,01Hacker 1: (With squinting grimace) ah! shit, will you close the fucking door?

15,01   (Light fades and we hear a door close)
15,01   (Hacker two enters from foreground)

15,01Hacker 2: (Singing) It's a beautiful morning... i think i'll... (suddenly
15,01   stops singing and shouts rudely) Jesus, what is that fucking smell?
15,01Hacker 1: It's me. i spent all last night digging through the dumpsters at
15,01   GTE. Those guys sure eat a lot of donuts. But actually, i havent showered
15,01   for three days, so i guess i deserve some of the blame.
15,01Hacker 2: Blame is for minor offenses, smelling like that is punishable by
15,01   a vigorous caning in some countries. So did you find anything?
15,01Hacker 1: (Disgusted) No.
15,01Hacker 2: So what are doing?
15,01Hacker 1: I'm trying to brute hack the GTE mainframe.
15,01Hacker 2: Oh. (watches for several minutes) You got a cigarette?

15,01   (Hacker 1 opens a pack and removes a cigarette with one hand while
15,01    typing, then motions the open pack in Hacker 2's direction. Hacker
15,01    2 takes a cigarette and sits with his back against the bed's headboard.
15,01    both hackers light up simultaneously. Hacker 2 picks up a copy of
15,01    Aristotle's ETHICS from the ground and begins to read.)

15,01   (a half-hour passes, the camera does not move)

15,01Hacker 1: Hey, i got one.
15,01Hacker 2: (Without looking up) Cool. is it a good one?
15,01Hacker 1: Dunno yet.
15,01Hacker 2: (Looks up from book) You got another cigarette?
15,01Hacker 1: (Pulls a cigarette from his pack and tosses it carelessly behind
15,01   his back) Freeloader.
15,01Hacker 2: (Struggles to stabilize cigarette without breaking it) hey, look
15,01   who's talking. (said while lighting cigarette)

15,01   (ten minutes passes)

15,01Hacker 1: Ah, shit, this guy is pretty low on the totem.
15,01Hacker 2: (Pseudo-sympathetically) Shit.

15,01    (ten minutes passes)
15,01    (Hacker 2 throws ETHICS carelessly back onto the two foot pile of books
15,01     on the floor. digs underneath the bed for several seconds before
