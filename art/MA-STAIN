15,01Stained-Glass

15,01Only now, looking back through the broken pieces of my life
15,01     as if through the panes of a  stained-glass window,
15,01Do I see the use of suffering, the relevancy of pain,
15,01For, if not for the shards of tainted glass, what beauty
15,01     does the window possess?
