15,01April 15, 2025
15,01--------------

15,01        Frank Sifton popped another cigarette into his mouth and lit it with a
15,01blue Bic lighter which he then tossed onto the dashboard. Although both of
15,01the front windows were drawn down as far as possible, the air in the car
15,01had still gone and stayed disgustingly stale after a hastily smoked pack of
15,01Marlboros. The clock under the climate controls read 11:30 pm. He sighed
15,01heavily with boredom. The street outside looked green through the light
15,01amplification mode of his Vision helmet.
15,01        Sitting in the passenger seat beside him was Jerry Kosk, the
15,01surveillance man and Sifton's partner for the night. Kosk was a thin, wiry
15,01man with darting eyes and a razor blade nose who had a deep, primal fear of
15,01pain. He sipped nervously at a warm-going-on-cold cup of coffee, dreading
15,01the events of the evening.
15,01        Two blocks down the street was a boxy, three-storied building with the
15,01words 'Scott's Olde Steak House' scripted in a gothic english font on a sign
15,01that hung precariously from the second floor. It shook gently with each
15,01passing breeze, perhaps preparing to fall and crush the next unfortunate
15,01person to walk through the doorway directly beneath it.
15,01        Sifton took one last drag on his cigarette and then crammed it into the
15,01car's ashtry which was already close to overflowing after a week's worth of
15,01chain smoking.
15,01        The door to Scott's swung open and was held by a tall, slender young 
15,01man in a black leather bomber jacket. Following him out was an equally young
15,01woman with long, unrestrained blonde hair that flowed along behind her as
15,01she moved. 
15,01        Catching the man's face in the box outlined in the middle of his visor,
15,01Sifton called up the Image ID feature and was met by an extensive parade of
15,01transparent, fluorescent green letters. They read:

15,01        "Black Cat to Bottle Rocket," Sifton said into the radio. "Two targets
15,01sighted heading north on Yonge. Primary target identification 'Elminster'
15,01confirmed." 
15,01        Bottle Rocket grunted dully in acknowledgement. "His girlfriend?"
15,01        Sifton elbowed Kosk sharply nearly causing him to spill his coffee into
15,01his lap. "Secondary Target 'Karen James' also confirmed," he stammered and
15,01gave Sifton a hurt wayward glance.
15,01        Bottle Rocket grunted again and announced "We're heading to the fifth
15,01floor of the Eaton Centre. We'll catch them as they come up. Fire Wheel,
15,01stand by."
15,01        A third voice, deep and throaty, briefly joined in. "This is Fire 
15,01Wheel. Our engines are running. Your call Bottle Rocket."
15,01        A series of hollow thumps and shuffling sounded in the receiver and
15,01then stopped. "Bottle Rocket in position. Looks like we'll be able to take
15,01this solo. They're heading into the target zone on their own. We'll tag them
15,01as soon as they get within range. This is too fucking easy."
15,01        Sifton grinned and stuck another cigarette into his mouth and lit it 
15,01while Kosk continued to sip at his coffee, partially relieved.

15,01                                 * * * * *

15,01        Karen James stepped out of the restaurant onto the sidewalk and took a
15,01deep breath of the crisp, cool April night air. A light breeze flicked
15,01lazily at the hem of her black evening dress making it flutter behind her.
