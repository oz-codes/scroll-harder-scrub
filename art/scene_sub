"Times change and technology progresses. Attackers adept and attacks evolve.
At this point in history, we can wax fondly for the halcyon days when computers
were hacked for pride or ego -- the good ole' simpler times when underground
hacker wars were electronically waged and the collateral damage was the main
website of The New York Times. Or the Solaris machines that were owned and the 
high profile computer security icons that had their e-mail spools stolen and 
personal poetry publicly posted. Or the OpenBSD machines that were rumored
to be silently owned and the early copies of the most lauded online underground
hacker journal that were distributed months ahead of time. Good times. Nowadays,
there is no underground hacker scene -- not like there used to be (bring back 
BoW and Hagis!)." -- Mike Schiffman from the introduction to _Hacker's_Challenge_3_

While route is indeed a whitehat sellout (and appears to like watching his
co-workers be publicly humiliated), he is certainly correct about one thing:
The Scene is IDLE. Not just a little idle, we're talking over a year of idleness
here. Sure, occasionally groups attempt to make a stir. Undoubtedly, some of
the readers will remember the PHC Delka Strike Force, hosted at http://el8.ru/x/
 (now down). Or the release of the epic h0no3 about one year ago. And of course,
our own fun little contributions. However, despite the hard work of a number of 
individuals, many of the goals originally set forth for pr0j3kt m4yh3m by el8 and 
the Phrack High Council have yet to be accomplished. This needs to change. 
Instead of chatting on IRC all day, go out and own a whitehat. Do a PHC mission. 
Contribute to pr0j3kt m4yh3m. 

The recent events revolving around the blogger known as "InfoSec Sellout" 
bring an interesting point to light. When the older "security professionals" 
discovered the "fact" that InfoSec Sellout was LMH and was backed by PHC, it
caused quite a stir for those that remembered the heyday of the pr0j3kt. For 
the whitehats that had just entered the industry post-whitehat holocaust, it 
didn't mean a thing. They simply assumed (like 90% of the HTS userbase) that 
PHC was/is a group of dissatisfied script kiddies. Too bad all the evidence
points to the contrary. Another sad fact is that whitehats have not only
taken over the public side of the scene, but the private side as well. These
"revelations" about InfoSec Sellout at one time would have come from an
anonymous post to FD, from a member of the underground. Now they come from a
"respected security professional". Instead of talking about the activities of
real hackers, the gossip reels these days deal with the exploits of whitehats
like David Maynor, HD Moore and others. Is this what we've allowed the scene to
become? A bunch of idlers thinking about fat middle aged whitehats? Where's the 
rage? Where's the dedication to the eradication of the greedy security 
consultants? Where's all the activity that was prevalent in the scene until 
recently?

A time has come for a change. Follow the example dikline set out. Take back the
scene! Go out and actually hack. Don't post exploits to FD; post a whitehat's
spools! Continue the legacy of the glorious pr0j3kt m4yh3m!

Never sell out, never surrender.
