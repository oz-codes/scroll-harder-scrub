00,01You point to me and ask me to heal
00,01I have not chosen this roll in life
00,01Yet you still tell me to break your seal
00,01To end your disgusting little strife
00,01I pity you, in my mistake
00,01I cannot find an explanation
00,01The man that you have faked
00,01You continue your own degradation
00,01I watch from my tower
00,01And wish I were15 00you
00,01I find stupid power
00,01In the lives that you persue
00,01Funny in my pitiful dealings
00,01I see you in moronic doubt
00,01I see your hopeful feelings
00,01And feel as a small lout
00,01I cannot understand
00,01Or try to ever know
00,01Yet I still make pretend
00,01And put on the proper show
00,01I make your break from your fall
00,01Yet you hide from my ways
00,01For you fear the death thrall
00,01And the man still says...
