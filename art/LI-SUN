15,01She walked slowly, carefully, in the autumn rain.  The skies radiated gray over
15,01the landscape, draining all colour into their hungry mass.  No umbrella
15,01protected her from the savage elements.  She preferred to feel the touch of
15,01nature upon her.

15,01She paused for a moment, and looked up into the dull, gray sky.  No texture, no
15,01life.  Just a mass of pouring, raining gray.  No sign of passing, or abating.

15,01As the rain licked her face gently, she began to smile.  Slightly at first, and
15,01then progressing into a wide beam.  The smile began to melt away the rain,
15,01drying even the evidence it left on the ground.  Its force burned into the
15,01clouds, boiling their immense grayness, down to wisps of white, dotting a wide,
15,01yawning, blue sky.

15,01The smile brought colour back to the trees, the grass, the flowers.  Everything
15,01whose natural beauty had been robbed by the gray, had been restored by her.

15,01She resumed walking, and glanced around her at all the beautiful things there.  
15,01It was enough to make her smile.

15,01Except...
15,01                ...she already was.
