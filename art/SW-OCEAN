15,01Evolution's End                        

15,01Surrounded, -- by a beautiful blue ocean,
15,01so smooth, and pure, with graceful motion.
15,01And beyond the sea, lies an enchanting sunset,
15,01who's powers are vast, and yet to be met.
15,01The crystal clean water, is something unreal,
15,01with powerful waves, and a taste you can feel.
15,01It's hard to believe, something as beautiful as thee,
15,01is being polluted, and treated so horribly.
15,01You wish there was something you could possibly do,
15,01to help heal nature, and the rest of the world too.
15,01If only we all joined hands, and met as one,
15,01maybe we could put an end, to what the governments done.
15,01Even if we fail, it would be worth a shot,
15,01to try and gain our ocean back, 
15,01and untie, this crooked knot.
