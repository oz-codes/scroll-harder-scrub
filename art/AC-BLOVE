15,01-+-- - --------------------------- - --+-

15,01could you ever love me once more?
15,01will you embrace on a new life and open your door.
15,01try to see my ways of living
15,01and try to understand who i am.

15,01what we had was something special
15,01not to be wasted on a one night stand
15,01and 15 minutes of what seemed right
15,01that has turned in to 15 minutes of wrongs

15,01in all my years never have i loved
15,01never have i seen
15,01and never have i had the chance to be with
15,01such a women with your beauty and ravaging touch

15,01you were always there for me
15,01and i perceived your kindness
15,01for once in my life i have chosen
15,01something that meant something

15,01and now i have given up all hope
15,01for i have taken your love and left it out to dry
15,01in the waterless deserts of passion
15,01where you no longer rest

15,01if i had one last chance
15,01if i could take it all back
15,01if i never did you wrong
15,01you would see
