15,01I was homesick
15,01the pain was palpable        I felt it tearing at me at the hard surface of my
15,01skull

15,01etching lines deep into the inner surface of my head.

15,01But now I've discovered an even deeper pain.

15,01I've grown.
15,01           I've changed.






15,01How would my old cohorts react to me ?

15,01They wouldn't know me.
15,01                       They would expect me to be the person that's been




15,01FROZEN IN THEIR MINDS.

15,01For three years. might as well be a lifetime.





15,01I would be a ghost who let them down. A shadow that isn't quite the way they
15,01remembered.

15,01Would I have to be the old me to fit in again ?
15,01Would I have to forget everything i've done or learned ?


15,01Not if they really care, you might say.























15,01i'm not so sure.
