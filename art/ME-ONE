15,01The wind blows deep inside her brain and to the west she turns her eyes
15,01Rain drips from her cheeks like tears but she is not one who cries
15,01Forgotten in the long run and ignored in the now, she is dead
15,01Searing blade cuts the length of her ego to a shred
15,01Instead

15,01Puddles of blood and oil and pigment mix on the avenue
15,01People that see me and they laugh and point and taunt and I pity you
15,01Cold hearted snake of desire in a hole with a shrew, please do
15,01Open the door to the pit and slither by the porch slimy in dew
15,01Slew

15,01Blue eyes and contentment are forced to the background, carved with flint
15,01And I don't care to look into your stomach afraid to see the glint
15,01Killer green combined in the ocean radiated to the sky and fore
15,01Tears drop from her cheeks and to the ground, melted the core
15,01Sore

15,01And to the front swings the canopy holding the treasure
15,01She cannot resist the temptation for Pandoras box and the pleasure
15,01Stabs the blade of desire deep into the heart of the matter
15,01Why your compliments, your humor, your personality all it does is flatter
15,01Clatter

15,01And you love me and to the north we turn, head upwards my son
15,01See what your life has earned you and what you have done
15,01And as she pulled the cord, it opens and you have won
15,01Body opens to embrace the all glowing, loving sun
15,01One.
