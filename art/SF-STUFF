15,01      Hi there, boys and girls. I'm Superfly and this is the latest and
15,01     greatest lowdown on the art department. I wrote last time on behalf
15,01     of the now defunct lit department. Anyways the art department isn't
15,01     looking to great right now. If I sound a little pessimistic, I am.
15,01     It's really hard to keep a group alive let alone growing while losing
15,01     original members all the time. I really don't know how many people are
15,01     in the art dpartment right now, but I know that there is at least one
15,01     who doesn't belong...yet. This month you'll see more of my stuff along
15,01     with Techmaster's and maybe some Trilobyte (oh, did I mention that he's
15,01     gone now?) work. I don't know how long we can last without getting
15,01     some new blood. We have potential, this is true, so if you think you
15,01     can contribute, get in touch with us at CB4. Whelp gotta go, check out
15,01     my other article in this month's DoPE newsletter.
