15,01     Today, a horrendous disaster has occured in the prestigous Mecha-Japanese 
15,01company "Blender24" involving two of their most skilled robots.
15,01     A beaten toaster was found in the factory at about 2:30AM yesterday morning
15,01with fatal wounds to its main circuits, along with the fingerprints of the 
15,01guilty robots.
15,01     After a quarrel was heard by the night supervisor at the plant, police were
15,01notified and arrived on the scene within minutes. Although they were too late  
15,01to prevent the apparent gang-beating of the toaster, they were able to trace the
15,01robots to a nearby bush, where they were performing a religious ritual.
15,01     The toaster, currently unidentified, will remain in the Blender24 storage
15,01room until its family can be contacted.
15,01     In the meantime, the robots await their sentence in Mecha-Japanese 
15,01jail.  Due to a recent revolt in Mecha-Japan, robot crime has risen to an
15,01appalling rate.  Military defence experts may even ressurect the dreaded Mecha-
15,01Mothra to retaliate against the violence.
