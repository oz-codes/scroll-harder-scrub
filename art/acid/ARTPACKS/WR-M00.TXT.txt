15,01And out of the darkness crawl the creepy things that scare the children.
15,01Yes, it's that time again.  March 17,  St. Patrick's Day.  Or, as those in the
15,01know call it, St. Drunkenday.  Oh, the times we've had, just you, me, cheap
15,01beer, and poisonous food additives.  All hail acceptable stereotypes!
15,01God bless the Irish for all being a bunch of drunks.  Sirs, I salute you!

15,01If only this had been pack 40, then I could have worked in more drinking
15,01analogies.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  You've got to
15,01love clichees like that.  It never stops, and for that I'm somewhat thankful.

15,01The naysayers do their thing, and Remorse does its, and never the two shall
15,01meet.  The last time I was around these parts, it was as the guy trying to keep
15,01everything together.  Thank God I'm not doing that anymore.  Most people should
15,01understand that those who choose to lead either want to better the world, or
15,01they have a death wish.  I'm not sure which category I fall into.

15,01Everyone that's been around a while has their own "back in the day" stories,
15,01and I'm no exception.  Perhaps time has changed my perspective, but I'm in the
15,01boat with those people that believe a group is about family.  Sure, you may
15,01argue with each other every so often, but you know the only way you're getting
15,01away from them is if they manage to get themselves married off to someone you'll
15,01never have to see again.

15,01Ah, if only...

15,01I'm pretty sure I'm off tangent here, so how about a triumphant ascii return:


15,01.dS$^ ^$Sb.
15,01$$$$   $$$$
15,01`4S$bTd$S7'

15,01Boys and girls, that's what we in the business call "an in-joke".  Really, it's
15,01funny.

15,01No, really.  Funny.  Honest.

15,01Now for a few final words from HaikuBoy.

15,01crabs are good eating
15,01i like shellfish, oh hang on
15,01doc, why should i shave?
15,01one glimpse of the moon
15,01and all my troubles are gone.
15,01oh yuck, roseanne barr.

15,01remorse 41.
15,01not your father's ascii group,
15,01but almost as old.

15,01Good night, and don't forget to tip your server.  I'm here all week.
