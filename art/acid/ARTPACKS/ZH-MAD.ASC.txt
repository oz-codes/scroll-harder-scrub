15,01               Hello.
15,01My name is jerome.
15,01               I live in a cardboard box dowtown.
15,01 my mother was an indian from mars
15,01                                             and my dad is a coal miner.
15,01 We live in a cardboard box because my
15,01     older sister burned our trailor down when she was
15,01trying to make crystal meth to sell to our pastor

15,01                       My mom died during birth. for a long time.

15,01I blamed myself. but, then. my dad told me a story.

15,01  of how space-indians don't normally live after child birth.

15,01my dad showed me my mom's corpse. he had it in a yogurt cup
15,01     in the back of the fridge.  my friends and I used to make fun of that
15,01cup of green goo.  one time. I dared a friend to eat a spooful and he did.

15,01    once I had learned that my mother was in that cup of yogurt, I told my dad
15,01      about what happened a few years back.

15,01He was mighty pissed off, he went and got a baseball bat and he drove nails
15,01into it.. then he cut the heads of the nails off.


15,01        I was mighty scared.
15,01                           but, my dad, he took that bat..
15,01and, well. this is what he did.
