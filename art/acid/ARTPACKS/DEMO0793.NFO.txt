15,01        It became increasingly obvious after three months of discussion
15,01that there was not going to be any progress in the mega-demo if nobody was
15,01willing to coordinate the efforts and make the first move. Fine, that is all
15,01behind us now and I have taken the first steps towards making this baby fly!
15,01The demo is not going to be a 'slightly larger loader' by any means, in fact
15,01it is being conceived as a full-scale, Future Crew rivaling, iCE destroying
15,01masterpiece. There are a few obstacles in our way, however, and some of them
15,01are halting progress as I type. First off, there must be a way in which all
15,01of us can communicate. I have entertained suggestions of using the internet
15,01and IRC, but immediately realized that most people are not local to a dialup
15,01port. Internet may work for some of the coders, but it definately will not
15,01help out any of the artists, musicians, or myself. If somebody has found a 
15,01way to get on IRC through SprintNET let me know, or if anyone knows how to
15,01use internet e-mail through FidoNET speak now. Conferences, alliances, and
15,01three ways are great, but some people like Rocket Scientist and Machine Head
15,01and Mr. F/X are not capable of joining in. I have a hell of a time trying to
15,01coordinate three people's efforts into a simple loader, I cannot imagine my-
15,01self trying to do this.

15,01        So here we stand as individuals and not as a team. The fact is,
15,01if we are going to pull this off, we will have to communicate and get every-
15,01one together. Something is going to have to give here - and everyone is going
15,01to have to put 100% faith and trust into everyone else. We cannot have people
15,01saying that they will do this and that in these early stages and end up short
15,01in the final stages. The coding, artwork, and music is all within reach, and
15,01with the right concentration and determination we can create a demo that is 
15,01truly UNREAL. Camber has suggested that we forgoe our ego's and do this 
15,01demo in C with the speed routines and what not in Assembler. He swears that
15,01when you need to incorporate so many different types of code into one project
15,01that C is perfect. Anyone can voice their opinion on any aspect of this demo,
15,01and everything will be done by popular vote. The music aspect of this demo is
15,01covered, I am in hope that one of our coders will take the time to talk with
15,01Daredevil of Renaissance about obtaining routines for their .669 8-track
15,01composer. Most of the better songs written by the musicians are in that for-
15,01mat, yet nobody has written drivers for coding it. There is a major obstacle
15,01involved, and I believe it is the fact that Tran coded that module in V86
15,01mode to make it run quicker. I do know, however, that .669's are based of off
15,0133,000 Mhz instead of the normal 50,000 Mhz. Whatever that means, I know we
15,01need to write the drivers.

15,01        The art aspect of the demo will be a collaboration between standard
15,01VGA (320x200) drawings and standard VGA renderings from 3DStudio and what not.
15,01There is a small chance that we will go hi-rez, however, because more people
15,01are accepting the VESA standard every day. One chief reason for going hi-rez
15,01is because of the routines we already have for mode-x 360x480 and the quality
15,01of the artwork that we can produce. You can have my word that we will not go 
15,01hi-color though (1024x768x16,000,000). I know for a fact that Acoustik and
15,01Shockwave draw in the 640x480 mode most comfortably. And I also know that
15,01Dyinhell goes 1024x768 by choice. Thank god for Diehard and Raiden, they 
15,01make magic in 320x200. 

15,01        As far as coders are concerned, Camber is extremely versatile in
15,01all makes and shapes of vectors and has developed some kind of 3 dimensional
15,01graphics engine that absolutely flies due to hidden polygon jargon. He also
15,01has spoken of some mind boggling effect he can put to any 3DStudio picture
15,01which makes it look like it came from a time warp or something having to
15,01do with adjusting the wire frame or something. As I'm sure you can see, I am
15,01hardly programming literate. Deadbolt is the most anxious to get started and
