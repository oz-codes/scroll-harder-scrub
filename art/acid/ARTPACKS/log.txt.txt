15,01*** disco74 (disco@darkerotica.com) has joined #thehood
15,01<whirr> hey disco.
15,01<whirr> got a question for you.
15,01<disco74> yO
15,01<whirr> odelay.
15,01<disco74> what about it?
15,01<whirr> i've been hearing some things, and i was wondering what the truth of the
15,01 matter was.
15,01<disco74> Well, that depends on what you've been hearing
15,01<Wh0dini> disco - you trying to bring odelay back?
15,01<whirr> yeah, that would be it.
15,01<disco74> well, now would be a good time to lie.  But the thought has crossed my
15,01 mind in recent 
15,01  weeks, yes.
15,01<Wh0dini> you been recruiting?
15,01<disco74> i've been seeing if there would be interest in the matter.
15,01<whirr> i'd like to address something i've heard here, that you feel under appre
15,01ciated.
15,01<whirr> and if so, why.
15,01<disco74> well, whatever was said is wrong.  
15,01<Wh0dini> disco - basically what we want to know is do you intend to start up ka
15,01rma, and if so do 
15,01  you plan on recruiting remorse members?
15,01<disco74> karma?
