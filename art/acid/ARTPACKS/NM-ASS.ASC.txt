15,01<Mutt> Are there common rules regarding ass scratching in someone else's
15,01       house?
15,01<nMANCEr> Mutt: Well, you can scratch your ass, you just can't make it
15,01          obvious. Lean up against something.
15,01<Mutt> nM: What if I lean against another person.. it that kosher?
15,01<nMANCEr> Mutt: Only if you're invited to do so.
15,01<nMANCEr> Mutt: Or, possibly, it could be a slip. "OOPS! Sorry, slipped."
15,01<Mutt> nM: What are the max number of furniture rubs you're allowed per
15,01       minute, so as not to be overly conspicuous?
15,01<nMANCEr> Mutt: 10.
15,01<nMANCEr> Anymore than that, and people will think you have a furniture fetish
15,01          or a bad case of fleas.
15,01<nMANCEr> And it's all in how you rub it, you know? I mean, if you go up to it
15,01          like a dog in heat and start pumping away, it really ruins the
15,01          purpose of the "furniture booty scratch." You have to downplay the
15,01          whole thing.
15,01<Mutt> So is there a number of stratches per minute, or does it just relate to
15,01       the number of people around..?
15,01<Mutt> I mean..
15,01<Mutt> right now nobody is around
15,01<nMANCEr> Well, if you're alone, then you don't really need to employ the
15,01          furniture-scratch.
15,01<Mutt> so I'm using Kathy's phone
15,01<Mutt> and I'm just MINING away
15,01<Mutt> and it's great
15,01<nMANCEr> You might as well just do whatever it takes to get the job done, you
15,01          know? 
15,01<nMANCEr> Yeah, phones work well.
15,01<nMANCEr> So do sporks.
15,01<nMANCEr> But if there are people around, then subtlety is key.
