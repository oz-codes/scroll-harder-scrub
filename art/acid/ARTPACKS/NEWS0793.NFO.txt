15,01         The Friday before the last weekend before the June
15,01ACiD acquisition 'update' is released and all is quiet in the staff.
15,01Der Schatten, ACiD Courier Coordinator, is home tired from a long day
15,01of three-waying artists and coders. It probably doesn't help his con-
15,01dition any that he is also supplying SWAT, or the fact that he has
15,01a job and is enrolled in school. Rad Man's in San Jose, downshore from
15,01his Seattle home, on vacation where he is virtually useless. It is his
15,01birthday, however, and many of the artists have taken it upon themselves
15,01to greet him in their works. I have yet to find a reason to kiss his
15,01ass, probably the reason why I'm not Senior Staff. Sharp is probably 
15,01studying even though he's out of school for a while, but he might be 
15,01playing Pirate's Gold, his first ware all year! Rocket Scientist has had 
15,01family down for the entire month and has had trouble finding the time 
15,01necessary to augment his library of source with anything new or fresh. 
15,01Shardik is having a little trouble with OS/2 and Vision-X and so Helter 
15,01Skelter is temporarily down for repairs. Deathknight, ACiD telecom 
15,01coordinator, has been putting most of his free time into his PWA position 
15,01as Courier Coordinator and thus the communication between members of the 
15,01group has been weak this month. I'm here I guess, struggling to come up 
15,01with enough meat for the pack as usual. I was on vacation in various 
15,01regions of the northeastern sector of the country and thus not much 
15,01happened for the first half of the month. 
15,01        
15,01        Anyways, this may be my sixth month in ACiD, but it is really the 
15,01'hat trick' month of 1993. For the third time I can honestly say that the 
15,01ACiD team has pulled off a miracle and produced at the wire. Members who 
15,01ordinarily contribute very little artwork in favor of having it be top notch 
15,01somehow found it within themselves to produce art of the same calibre in 
15,01quantity. Special thanx goes out to Panama Jack, Golgotha, and Vision for 
15,01their unusual effort this month. As far as the ACiD VGA division is con-
15,01cerned, much emphasis is being placed on the very distant demo in the making. 
15,01The ACiD staff would like to introduce Deadbolt to the artists and to all 
15,01of the ACiD fans worldwide. Deadbolt has been begging for the demo for some 
15,01time and is finally going to get it (I hope he can handle it <g>). Look to 
15,01see artwork by Acoustik, Shockwave, Mondoman, Cerebrus, and Dyinhell. 
15,01Expect music from the Sonic Ecstasy Team and the other ACiD musicians. 
15,01In case you are not aware, Sonic Ecstasy joined up with ACiD at the beginning 
15,01of May and is made up of four members, DJ Krython D, Rhythm Addiction, 
15,01Nocturnal Intruder, and Low Profile. Also note that Dyinhell (VGA artist) 
15,01is from Sonic Ecstasy. The demo will be coded entirely in assembler and will 
15,01most definately be entered into the competitions in Europe. Right now I 
15,01would like to personally greet Daredevil of Renaissance for helping me help 
15,01our coders work with their sound routines. I am in hope that ACiD will be 
15,01capable of coding .669 modules for the July acquisition update - someone 
15,01in ACiD take the hint and spend the month working it out for my birthday:). 

15,01        Anyways, back to the business at hand, let it be known that I did 
15,01not receive any kind of 14,000 dollar phone bill like Morbid Angel and 
15,01Nightstalker would like to have you believe, they simply woke my mother up 
15,01and to get rid of them she spewed a few sentences of bullshit and hung up. 
15,01I did get busted, however, even though I did not get in any type of criminal 
15,01suit. I had been using a 800 PBX for some of my calls which I eventually got 
15,01billed for. I won't tell you to learn a lesson from my experience because I 
15,01am currently scanning my area for System-75's :). Oh well, I only hope that 
15,01the coders come through for me over the weekend and produce up to the ACiD 
15,01standard so that I can co-release my first acquisition with Der Schatten on 
15,01Wednesday evening[Ed. Note: CoughTHURSDAYcough :) ]. Who knows, if I am really 
15,01efficient, it might come out in the morning to help it spread on time. It's not 

15,01hard to spread an acquisition when you have Elusive Dreams as your WHQ though, 
15,01but many thanks still go out to the SWAT couriering team who have helped us to 
15,01distibute the pack nationwide so that it is more readily available to everyone. 

15,01I even thank Cyberchrist ahead of time, but also warn him to stay in iCE 
15,01because he does not belong in ACiD and needs to assume the legacy that Shihead 
15,01Kallamazoo has left behind when he formed TRiBE. Oh well, this has got to 
15,01be my longest paragraph ever ... l8r

15,01Greets go out to:

15,01Rad Man: I should get into that friends and family plan!
15,01Sharp: I'm getting your little Indian airline waitress's phone number :)
15,01Der Schatten: I hope the Braves approve of our charging to them!
15,01Rhythm Addiction: I wish I could code a .669 as well :)
15,01Golgotha: I will eventually see the BI/QS ansimation w/ the cow, right!
15,01Liquid Nitro: You will draw many ansi's this month :)
15,01TMOD: You call me in the early morning, I'll wake your ass at night bitch!
