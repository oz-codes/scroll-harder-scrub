15,01At one point in time mESSIAH and I were gonna do a joint, but he had other
15,01obligations to fulfill so I went a head and did the entire thing, It says
15,01"Prodigy" I haven't a fucking clue where messiah got it from, but I did it
15,01anyway. I've included the lyrics to the song I was listening to when I did
15,01So prephaps you might understand what I was feeling when I did it, booyah.
15,01-zerohour(remorse)-

15,01ps. I think these lyrics are pretty much better than anything poem, book,
15,01novel to emerge from the last three decades.

15,01Nectar:

15,01I arose from the lullaby
15,01Enduring yet another tale
15,01You tempt me again,
15,01With your embrace so tainted
15,01Within the night you beckon
15,01Cursing me with every glance.

15,01Bring me through
15,01Carry my empty shadow,
15,01And guide me inside your warped labyrinth
15,01To the well of sin.
15,01I swear I will always love you.

15,01Leave me speechless
15,01Release my yearning
15,01The soul I walk is clad with light
15,01Drifting moons thrust me with their rays
15,01And I fall inside.

15,01I lament this heritance
15,01Cannot bid farewell
15,01The pale face... you went as far as you could
15,01And from that moment
15,01I witnessed your beauty, felt your death.

15,01Mine is yours, Mine is yours.

15,01In the wake of dawn
15,01The mist of morning lingers before it leaves
15,01Invisable eyes, red reflection.
15,01It is you
15,01Souling in the midst of the moor.

15,01>From the album morningrise, by the band "Opeth."
