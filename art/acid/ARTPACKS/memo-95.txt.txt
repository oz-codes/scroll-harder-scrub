15,01September 1st, 2002 :: ACiD Turns 12 Years Old :: History in the Making


15,01     It was late March 2000 when I, for personal reasons, began to
15,01rapidly distance myself from all aspects of the scene and ACiD.  I
15,01had just released acid-88 following our traditional February sabbatical,
15,01then continued to watch from deep within the shadows as we dropped from
15,01our consistent schedule of eleven packs per year to something more semi-
15,01annual.  With limited involvement, I had the luxury of overseeing the
15,01production of two additional Acquisition Updates between now and then...


15,01     Prophecies still remain which ACiD must fulfill.  It was almost
15,01precisely one month ago today that I was inspired to see to it that
15,01these visions are finally realized and the entire group has responded
15,01by returning with a vengeance that is clearly self evident in this
15,01artpack.


15,01     As usual, much more is happening behind the scenes than can be
15,01conveyed in the digital imagery we've provided.  As we draw near the
15,01release of our epic 100th Acquisition Update, our extended family of
15,01Remorse and pHluid approach their 50th packs as well.  Plans are
15,01currently developing to produce our most memorable collaboration ever.


15,01And on that note:  Enjoy the pack.
