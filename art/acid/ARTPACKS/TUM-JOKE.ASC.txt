15,01Hello, TUM here. During my time in the computer art scene, I've had the
15,01opportunity to meet many "unique" individuals. Often this more human side to
15,01IRC is lost when one looks back through the countless packs and sees only
15,01obscure typing, overinflated ego's, and gratuitous insults. In response, I took
15,01it upon myself to create an easy to see but difficult to comprehend symbol and
15,01use show it to various ascii scene icons to gauge their reaction. Hopefully
15,01you can see into their characters just a bit through their responses.

15,01Here's the symbol:      .\ /.
15,01                        '/ \'


15,01Here are the responses... Enjoy =)
