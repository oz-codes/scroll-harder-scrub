15,01Hiya fellaz,

15,01        I hope you enjoyed this issue. I'm sure you did.  You'll probably say
15,01the  same thing as everyone else:  " Whoa man,  this is  wicked but  it's too
15,01damn short!".  Here's my answer: "Would you prefer  a 3-meg comic once a year
15,01or 2 or 3 shorter comics instead?"

15,01        Anyhow, I'm sorry for releasing one month later than planned. I had a
15,01major problem: Hard disk crash. Happens when you expect it the least. No need
15,01to tell you all  the important stuff i lost.  Next issue will be  out in less
15,01than 6 months, don't worry.


15,01                            .-. No More ACiD .-.

15,01        GrimScum isn't affiliated  with ACiD anymore.  I am proud to announce
15,01you that  we are  now part  of iCE  (Insane Creators Enterprises).   Why this
15,01radical change? Simply because almost all GrimScum members are in iCE now.


15,01                       .-. The Dark Side Of The Web .-.

15,01        I finished the Grim Scum web page a couple of months ago. You can get
15,01the first issue from it (http://www.ice.org/~assassin).  It's an old page but
15,01I'm gonna change a lot of things as soon as I get my internet account working
15,01again. I'll also add a photo album on it.


15,01                             .-. Hidden What? .-.

15,01        Sound.   This is one of the numerous new features in the new GrimScum
15,01Interface.  There are three hidden sounds in this issue.  Try to find them by
15,01moving your mouse on the screen.   When the cursor changes to a speaker, just
15,01lay your finger,  hammer or whatever you want on your mouse's left button and
15,01listen carefully.


15,01                                .-. Facts .-.

15,01I'd like you to know that we're not doing this for money, drugs or whatever.
15,01This is only for the love of art.

15,01FunFact: As you probably noticed, this issue fits on a 1.44 megs disk so feel
15,01free to distribute the comic wherever you want to!


15,01                               .-. Da Crew .-.

15,01If you're interested in joining  the GrimScum Crew as a writer, musician, vga
15,01artist, distro site or anything, email Overbored (ovrbored@ice.org)  for more
15,01info.  Also, i  need someone  to help me  with colouring,  so  if you  are an
15,01EXPERIENCED vga artist contact Overbored about it. We need a mailing list, so
15,01if you can set one up for us, then again email Overbored.
