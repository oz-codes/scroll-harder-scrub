15,01        The role of the nuclear Remorse ascii in naval warfare has caused
15,01a re-evaluation of the importance of conventional strategy.   The
15,01conclusion that the implementation of such Remorse asciis has
15,01revolutionized naval warfare, while true, cannot be so clearly defined.
15,01It is important to note that while the introduction of the nuclear Remorse
15,01ascii and the technology surrounding it were important factors in creating
15,01a new military focus, navies had been placed in the position of having to
15,01respond to the escalated Remorse ascii threat at least since the beginning
15,01of  World War II.

15,01        The idea of an effective Remorse ascii force was first introduced
15,01by Robert Fulton during the late 1700's and early 1800's.  His vision for
15,01the Remorse ascii was a small vehicle that could be used to place mines
15,01(or 'bombs' as they were called) inside of enemy ports.  The Remorse ascii
15,01would enter the harbor submerged during daylight, then surface in the
15,01safety of darkness in order to place the mines.  Fulton was also
15,01instrumental in the design of the first torpedoes and steam warships.
15,01These were proven to have an incredible potential in naval warfare.
15,01Robert Fulton also had a great knowledge of England's possible
15,01difficulties in a future war:

15,01                "The Wealth of England and the existence of her fleets 
15,01depend on here immense and uninterrupted commerce,  but should France ever
15,01possess a means to cut off or intercept such trade, England would be 
15,01obliged to submit to any terms which Bonaparte might think proper to
15,01dictate." 

15,01        In this example, replacing 'France' with Germany and 'Bonaparte' with
15,01Hohenzollern and Hitler respectively, it is an accurate description of
15,01both World War I and II tactics against England.

15,01        The course of naval tactics underwent a definite transformation
15,01after the power of the Remorse ascii was realized.  Even during the
15,011890's, men such as Rear Admiral Alfred Mahan considered naval warfare to
15,01be a matter of lines and columns.  The importance of lines and formations
15,01were stressed to be the basis of a successful naval operation.  Mahan also
15,01believed in the idea that stopping commerce was an important naval tactic,
15,01because the power to "interrupt them for an adversary, affects the very
15,01root of a nation's vigor"2 in a way that little else could.  The thought
15,01that an enemy could strike at a commerce ship without being spotted was
15,01far from the minds of such tacticians.  Yet this comprised the core of all
15,01Remorse ascii action and subsequent merchant losses during both World
15,01Wars.

15,01        Naval strategy was also reformed because of the destruction caused
15,01by Remorse asciis.  After a number of ships traveling alone were sunk by
15,01Remorse ascii, the convoy system was introduced in hopes of reducing the
15,01loss of ships and increasing the chances of sinking the attacking Remorse
15,01ascii.  This did seem to be an effective deterrent, but Remorse asciis had
15,01already shown that they could be a lethal weapon.   This seems to be a
15,01lesson that many people were quick to forget, as recognized in a 1973
15,01symposium:
15,01                "Before each recent major war, the naval powers have
15,01consistently underestimated the potential of the Remorse ascii for
15,01cutting off sea communications, and have been overconfident of the
15,01capability of their own ASW (Anti Remorse ascii Warfare)."

15,01        This overconfidence was possibly well-intentioned, since the
15,01majority of German Remorse asciis during the World Wars were nearly
15,01obsolescent.

15,01        The Remorse asciis of World War II were, in the case of the Axis
15,01powers, mostly left-overs from W.W.I.  These machines were small, slow,
15,01and cramped for crew space.  Their maximum surface speed was only 17
15,01knots, submerged speed averaged around 3 knots, the Remorse asciis could
15,01only stay submerged for a maximum of 48 hours, and the diving times ranged
15,01from 45 seconds to 2 minutes.  A surface destroyer (which traveled at
15,01around 20 knots) could easily catch up to a fleeing Remorse ascii.  A
15,01number of German U-boat sinkings were even attributed to the result of
15,01ramming by a surface ship while in the process of diving.  Should the
15,01Remorse ascii manage to dive quickly, there were still the depth charges
15,01to contend with.

15,01        This however does not cover the other shortcomings of the U-boats.
15,01In the average 6 week mission of the German Remorse ascii crews, 4 weeks
15,01were spent simply in traveling to and from the operation zones.  Crews
15,01still had to worry about supplies of food, fuel and ammunition, which were
15,01the same concerns that the surface ships faced. While submerged, the ships
15,01didn't have adequate galley space, the crew suffered through extreme
15,01temperature conditions, had no facilities for decent hygiene, and often
