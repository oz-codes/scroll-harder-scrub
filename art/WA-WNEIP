15,01        When nothing else is possible, we're not quite so picky about
15,01what we do, we simply take what is offered.  but the question i would pose
15,01is: what exactly is human choice.  what makes one person any different
15,01from any other.  why is it that when one person is given the choice to
15,01choose from, for example, a book or a leaf of paper and pen, some people
15,01would choose the book, whereas some others would choose the leaf and pen.  
15,01one a reader, one a writer.  but what makes them that? is this something
15,01that stems from childhood and the recognisance and thus prejudice against
15,01what we percieve we cannot do, or more aptly what we are not proficient
15,01at, or is it truely what we prefer? the person given the leaf and pen
15,01also has several choices.  that one may write on, draw on, stab, smudge,
15,01rip, or scribble on the paper, or any combination of those.. but what
15,01again is the impetus which causes us to do these things.  let us also
15,01take into account the iconoclast who chooses neither of the above, but is
15,01content to simply sit or lie and wander amidst their own conciousness.
15,01human choice is perhaps another of the few unidentifiable and therefore
15,01nonexistant terms.
