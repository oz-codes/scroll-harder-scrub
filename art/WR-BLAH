15,01                        is proud (?)
15,01        to present a little whatzit lovingly called:


15,01             THIS ISN'T AN ASCII COLLY, DAMMIT!!



15,01   What this IS is a little recap of why someone you've never
15,01ever ever heard of is in a remorse!ascii pack.  In order to 
15,01answer this, i'm going to tell you two versions of the same story.


15,01        STORY #1:  I haven't been around for about 6 months, so
15,01                   kiss my hairy white-boy ass.

15,01        Wasn't that special.  Short and sweet, right to the point.
15,01But somehow i figure that's not going to be enough for my die-hard
15,01fans who have wondered where i've been (all 0 of you).  It is for
15,01you, the loving masses, that i graciously include this, the second 
15,01version of my story.




15,01   Story #2:  WindRider's journey into the small town Saskatchewan

15,01        I'm 25 and just about to finish up my degree in Education.
15,01That's right, i'm gonna be a teacher.  Yes, i'm scared too, but that's 
15,01not the point.  The point is that my internship took place well away 
15,01from where i currently live.  And now i'm going to beat you about the 
15,01head with all the details of the place.

15,01        I was at a little school of 240 students (k through grade 9)
15,01called St. Gabriel's in the small town of Biggar, Saskatchewan.  The 
15,01population is probably around 1000-1500 or so.  It's got a weekly 
15,01paper that's about 16 pages or so (no color).  There's a swimming pool,
15,01a rink, a curling rink, and one of the biggest malting plants in 
15,01Western Canada.

15,01        I stayed in a nice little house (in the basement) about 6 blocks
15,01from the school.  It's also interesting to note that i doubt there's 
15,01anywhere in town further than 9 blocks from anywhere.  The rent was 
15,01WAY too high, but that's okay.  And here concludes the relatively
15,01uninteresting portion of our program.

15,01        I taught kids age 11-14.  i was in grade 6 phys ed; grade 7
15,01health and social studies; grade 8 social, science, art, christian ed;
15,01grade 9 art, science, social, lit, and christian ed.  By far the best
15,01group of kids had to be the Grade 9's.  They were a sweet bunch.

15,01        On that topic, i realized something the day i got back from my 
15,01four months out there.  The wife of a friend of mine used to be a 
15,01school librarian technician (whatever that means).  She pointed out that
15,01Grade 9 girls will flirt like mad with interns because somewhere in the 
15,01back of their minds they think that the intern might be their boyfriend.
15,01Now that surprised the hell out of me, but when i look back on it, all 
15,01the signs were there.  When they found out i was going to coach the 
15,01girls basketball team, about half the girls who came out were in grade
15,019, and many of them had never shown an interest in basketball before.
15,01To be quite honest, the team stank, and bad.  but it was still fun to
15,01be out there and interact with them.  even looking back at the video
15,01tape i made of my last couple days out there, i can see that some of 
15,01them were playing up to me.  I consider myself lucky to consider some of
15,01them to be close acquaintances.  To call them friends would seem a bit
15,01odd, since i'm 11 years older than they are.  On the other hand, Woody
15,01Allen (age 60ish) just got married to a 20something year old.  the sick
15,01and evil part of my mind keeps trying to tell me to look some of them
15,01up in 3 years when they get out of high school.  But that's just sick.
15,01Or is it....

15,01        Let's hope that's the end of our little trip into the Pedophile
15,01Zone.


15,01        I just noticed that i haven't said a damn thing of interest.
15,01Oh well, it doesn't bother me any.  I consider it practice for my future
15,01career. h0h0h0h0h0h0.
