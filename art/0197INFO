15,01              14"15"      ..hello and welcome to novel writing, live from Brighton.
15,01                   this is the 0041st cia conspiracy 15containing artwork and other
15,01                such things from the latter part of 12/96 & the earlier part of
15,01                1/97. As you may have deducted, this is the 00information file 15my
15,01                name is napalm, secret agent double oh napalm, this is my story

15,01                                   02Chapter 12][

15,01         On a cold and icy night in mid july a dark man wearing nothing
15,01        but a plaid skirt and horse hair handed me an envelope.  It was
15,01        clearly labeled: 00Member Information


15,01         ..opening the envelope carefully i noticed a small scrap paper
15,01        with the words: 00new members 15printed on it in third grade  hand-
15,01        writing.. even the e's were backwards, this could only mean one
15,01        thing.. 00empty 15had rejoined the group & had taken over the 00ascii
15,01        department while discyple takes a break. trying to read his bad
15,01        penmanship i noticed the names of 00hellfire15, 00sammael15, 00black jack
15,01        & 00cyndicide  15joining ascii ranks,  it also appeared that 00trahma
15,01        wished to  be  referred to by  his new  secret agent name, 00dark
15,01        00entity15, not to be  confused with darkened  emnity or whatever..
15,01        listed under  ansi  appeared the names  00ironghost15,  00sinister x15,
15,01        00mr. 4tune 15and 00estatic15. The word zeul][  was crossed  out due to
15,01        a grevious spelling  error and  replaced with  00zeus][ 15, like it
15,01        should have  been last  month 14(sorry zii!)  00garf 15and 00sinister x
15,01        join the coding crew, 00tonto 15says hello to  the music department
15,01        and 00reebok 15returns to the lit side of things. reading on, i saw
15,01        that 00julian 15had been promoted to 00revival co-coordinator 15&  that
15,01        00unholy spirit 15had become 00telecom coordinator15..

15,01         ..by my feet i notice a  small crumpled up piece of paper with
15,01        even more names on it. 14wintamute  15takes  off to focus attention
15,01        everyone's  favorite  80's  metal band  and now art group black
15,01        maiden. in early  december agent 14nahal 15was taken down by secret
15,01        school agents, rumor has it they clipped off 14tk 15in the process.
15,01        i  noticed that some  names  from last  month were missing from
15,01        both lists, it appeared that thay had actually been removed due
15,01        to inactivity or lack of contact with other cia members14.

15,01         ..rumor had it that my arch enemy and master villan known only
15,01        as '00shrike15' was back in town with a second  release of the all-
15,01        together evil music disk secretly dubbed '00chaos15' in  an attempt
15,01        to throw me off the  case. the un-marked package was released a
15,01        few weeks ago under the code name 00cia-dk02.zip15. this reminds me
15,01        to be  on the  look out for  cia's next music  release from the
15,01        newly dubbed '00defunct15'  music department  which  promises to be
15,01        even more  powerful and deadly than the previous two. my secret
15,01        photos even show the construction of a new playing utility..

15,01         ..my  continuing investigation  led me to the  down-town  area
15,01       known as the '13red canuck15' district. it was disgusting!  00triple15-00x
