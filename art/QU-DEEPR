15,0104/05/95, 04/30/95

15,01Deeper I travel,
15,01to realms unknown.
15,01I seek out answers for questions
15,01Peril, I search for you.

15,01Downward my mind travels,
15,01other directions need my strength.
15,01My will is gone.
15,01Down we all go, the power is not there to pull us up.

15,01Up we all look, but we all go down.
