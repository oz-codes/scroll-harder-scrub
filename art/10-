15,01 What is a 00scar15? For you it's justa reminder of carelessness, for which
15,01 you've paid by your own blood. It was painful, it was itching, drying up..
15,01 And sure thing you'll always 00remember15 you shoudn't be messing with
15,01 sharp and pointy thingies. You'll be careful and won't forget to warn
15,01 others about all the dangers of improper handling these things.  00Jerk15..
15,01 Scar is a 00memory15, vivid memory itself. The gate, which i use to let my
15,01 soul vacuum go. They will be. There will be more of them. They will be
15,01 wider. Take a 00knife15.

15,01 HRG 00birthday15. The year passed from the moment when new group-to-be of
15,01 some folks with an 00imagination15 decided to release all the stuff produced
15,01 in 002 years15  and to make it available to all the world. Since then many
15,01 changes happened. New people came. New 00creativity15 horizons appeared,
15,01 but the spirit, yes, the spirit that powered all that remained the
15,01 same. We are getting 00stronger15 and stronger in a way of art expression
15,01 of our souls. We are living our dawn, now. 00Happy15 birthday.

15,01 Haven't you heard our music? Then you don't realize the spirit of our group
15,01 to its full extent. Hellraiser ritual. An Impulse Tracker module.

15,01 This month two 00new 15artists replenished our force: 00Hazar15 and 00Immortal15.
15,01 Both are skillful in 3D composition. Welcome, guys.
15,01 00H15azar is new to scene, but his rendered landscapes will burn through your
15,01 mind with demonic beauty.
15,01 00I15mmortal left that stupid Religion group. His art are futuristic and
15,01 psychodelic pictures.

15,01 So, the artists of this month:
