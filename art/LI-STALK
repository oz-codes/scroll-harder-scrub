15,01   The first time I saw him, he looked like nothing more than an average guy,
15,01like anyone you might see on the street.  Absolutely nothing about him was at
15,01all abnormal; he could have easily blended into a crowd.  In fact, he looked
15,01almost too normal, as if he were trying.
15,01   After a few weeks, i noticed a few changes in his behaviour.  He started
15,01looking around, above, below, behind him.  As if he thought someone were
15,01watching him.  And yet he never once met my gaze.  Through all the directions
15,01he scanned, his glance never once fell upon me.  This in itself was odd, as if
15,01he knew I was there, and was just deliberately avoiding looking at me.
15,01   He never seemed paranoid, just mildly curious.  As if someone watching him
15,01was an acceptable fact, and he would just like to know who it was.  The fact
15,01that he had never seen me almost made it seem like he wanted me to know that he
15,01was looking for someone, but just couldn't see whoever it was.
15,01   He was either extremely perceptive, or completely innocent.
15,01   I had no particular reason for watching him.  There was nothing about him
15,01which I could not have seen in a thousand other pedestrians.  It was a
15,01completely arbitrary thing.  As far as I know.  Perhaps, something deep in my
15,01psyche, which is either too complex or too simple to understand, forced me to
15,01do it.
15,01   I didn't go out of my way to find him.  I simply followed my daily routine,
15,01and there he was.  Once in a while, he would disppear in a crowd, and suddenly
15,01emerge in the opposite direction to that which he was heading, as if to throw
15,01off prospective followers.  But he was so blatant in his movements, that they
15,01could not have been anything but simple changes in direction, or changes of
15,01mind.
15,01   He occupied a sizable portion of my life.  His presence nearly every day
15,01left an engram on my life.  And yet, my life never intersected with his, from
15,01all appearances.
15,01   Did he know I was there?  Had he been able to tell that I was watching the
15,01whole time?  Were his actions merely attempts to throw me off, or to see what I
15,01was up to?
15,01   I don't think so.
15,01   If he had been that perceptive of his surroundings, and aware of the people
15,01around him, he would never have allowed me to push him off the subway platform,
15,01in front of the oncoming train, where I watched him die.
