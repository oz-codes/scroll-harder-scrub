15,01Listen...

15,01In the time before time, from the great darkness
15,01A crystal-like voice rose from the abyss.
15,01A vibrant soprano shook the beyond
15,01And the song carried on and on and on...

15,01Stars joined, the piccolos of the band
15,01Then the planets, their tones were grand.
15,01The universe beat like a great bass drum,
15,01And so it goes on and on and on...

15,01Life everywhere turned to hear
15,01Every crocodile, wolf, giraffe and deer.
15,01To the song written on their very soul
15,01To be carried on and on and on...

15,01Now I turn to you, listen!
15,01Hear the song that makes every dew drop glisten.
15,01Can you hear the pitch, the tone, that grand melody?
15,01The same song for you as it is for me.
15,01Our Creators sung it and now shall we,
15,01Forever on and on and on...
