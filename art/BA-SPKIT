15,01tumblingdownblackhair
15,01      trailing in bloodstrings,
15,01  draw in the bars of your heart with indelible pen

15,01mark me your spacekitten
15,01                  arched matching eyebrows     back
15,01  doodling more fake lines with a twitch of the head

15,01jo's hair never stayed, she said
15,01      but for me it's just mange.

15,01o no, it's happening again (godown)
15,01spacekitten into airtightness into breath
15,01foul fuzz on my belly dyed purple with scars
15,01   bubbles a-forming on terrain called breast
15,01and a dripdripdrip of unwanted tickling 

15,01fingerprint me, honey.

15,01o spacekitten backflips are for the ones who matter
15,01    for innocence is wet with peeling tissue,
15,01and more effective ways for inkblots
15,01   to bear zulus to bear bars.

15,01catharsis in the knowledge that papers decompose
15,01       perspective - only depthrelated, but better than last week.

15,01cushions and cats don't mix, but you can fix them
15,01  pile over brick over pile of scrap you can sell.
15,01i love you nebulous and foamy
15,01         not bitterbruised and lumpy like a sick kitty
15,01        padding around the room on thorned paws
15,01deliberate to make movement forcedly gymnastic.
