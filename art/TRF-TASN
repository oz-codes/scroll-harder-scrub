15,01                        By The Red Flame

15,01 
15,01     The assassin krept along the city streets, his figure garbed
15,01in black, the color of an empty night.  His form slim, his steps
15,01agile, the instrument of death passed row upon row of dwellings,
15,01searching for his victim.
15,01     The house he sought loomed large in the distance, its
15,01glowing torches illuminiating the way for leagues.  The master of
15,01the mansion was a rich man, far too rich, plump from his wealth. 
15,01He might have had friends, but did not, and had a profusion of
15,01enemies.
15,01     Such a one had hired the assassin, who, clothed in midnight,
15,01padded softly along the empty cobblestoned streets.  His weapon
15,01was a long, silver bladed knife with the gold hilt, encrusted
15,01with rubies.  Often stained crimson, it had been carefully
15,01cleaned for this outing but would soon again feel the hot liquid
15,01tainting its surface--the assassin vowed to that.
15,01     Trotting briskly, yet never stopping to breathe and floating
15,01through the night like an invisible mist, the assassin moved
15,01onward to the mansion.  Its gates materialized out of the fog,
15,01monstrous, twisted towers of iron, barring entry.  Large torches
15,01set on sconces on the wall released rolling greasy smoke into the
15,01air, covering the neighboring walls with a pitch black residue. 
15,01Servants sleepily drifted back and worth, weapons held clumsily
15,01in their hands.
15,01     The assassin ignored the gates and ran towards the nearest
15,01wall, leaping upon it, his hands instantly finding the invisible
15,01nitches and gouges that would enable him to climb with the ease
15,01of a fly.  Silently, the assassin ascended swiftly up the
15,01verticle face of the wall, his face hidden with a mask of dark
15,01foreboding, his body a shade against the already black walls
15,01guarding the mansion.  Leaping over the top, and dropping fifteen
15,01feet through the freezing cold air, he landed upon rocky gravel. 
15,01A normal man would have slipped, making a loud grating sound, but
15,01the assassin adapted to the gravel like a cameleon shifting its
15,01color and made no sound.
15,01     The master's chambers were on the second floor.  The
15,01servents walked back and forth, their eyes half closed, their
15,01hands ineptly holding swords and halberds.  As a servant leaned
15,01back in his chair, preparing to sleep, his dimming vision fixed
15,01upon the doorway to the mansion, he noticed a black shadow glide
15,01in and melt into nothingness.  Had he been fully awake, such an
15,01unexplained happening might have been worth investigating, but he
15,01was suddenly asleep, snoring loudly.
15,01     The assassin was on the second floor of the mansion, evading
15,01wandering chamberlains with the cunning of a jackal.  His long
15,01shadow expanded on the slanted moonlight shining in through the
15,01window as he silently moved towards the large door in which the
15,01master slept.
15,01     The door creaked as it shut and the master twitched in his
15,01bed.  He had no need to sit upright, for he knew the door had
15,01already been closed and that the intruder was in the room.  He
15,01also knew that his guest was not a servent or a chamberlain.
15,01     And the assassin knew it too, had realized his careless
15,01mistake and overcorrected it.  But he was jumping to conclusions. 
15,01He was an assassin, a companion of night, one whose skills were
15,01so sharp that they were trained to awaken upon the slightest
15,01disturbence of the world around them.  And the master was a rich,
15,01bumbling fool.  The assassin reached for the silver blade with
15,01the gold handle and red rubies.  It was gone.
15,01     The master sat up in his bed, raised his arm with a flash,
15,01and before the assassin could overcome his surprise, the silver
15,01dagger was protruding from his chest, the golden hilt of the
15,01weapon resting in the master's flabby hand.  The assassin
15,01shuddered a few breaths and stared at the master in horror,
15,01knowing that for the first time in his life, he had made a
15,01mistake--A small mistake.  The assassin could not believe it had
15,01cost him his life.
15,01     A few minutes later the servents were called to the master's
15,01bedroom.  On the floor lay a man garbed in black clothing, so
15,01much so that he looked darker than that darkest of rooms of the
15,01mansion without light.  Sticking out of his bloody chest was a
15,01silver dagger, its blade stained crimson, with a gold hilt
15,01encrusted with rubies...
