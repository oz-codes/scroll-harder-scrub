15,01  Usage: WITHFONT fontfile command [arg(s)]
15,01         WITHFONT fontfile [ [-bN fontfileN] ... ]  [ -c ] command [arg(s)]

15,01Will run 'command' on 'args' using a text-mode font loaded from 'fontfile'.
15,01WITHFONT looks for 'fontname' in the current directory and then in all the
15,01directories listed in the FONTPATH environment variable. Multiple directories
15,01in FONTPATH are separated by ';' chars. The 'fontfile' name should be of the
15,01form *.fYY, where YY is the font height in pixels (a 2 digit number in the
15,01range 04-32). If the font height cannot be determined from the file name,
15,01then it is set to the file size divided by 256. All fonts loaded must be of
15,01the same height. The font load will not be effected by 'command' changing
15,01the video mode. WITHFONT cures some of MS-DOS 3.3+ CodePage braindamage.
