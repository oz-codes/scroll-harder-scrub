15,01One fine day in 7ville, a small planet came out to play
15,01but he found, to his dismay
15,01all the other planets had gone away
15,01so he chewed on a piece of raw damnation
15,01and stomped away in indignation
15,01and died from radiation
15,01so he cooked himself in a big fat oven
15,01cause he couldn't find any lovin'
15,01because he was the ugliest planet you've ever seen
15,01his entire population was bitter and mean
15,01they had a nuclear war in the middle of his spleen
15,01it looked quite keen
15,01but it burned so bright
15,01like a firelight
15,01and the whole planet turned to night
15,01just a giant cleansing, not even a fight
15,01and the people all died
15,01their bodies fried
15,01their souls all went to the other side
15,01the animals all tried
15,01to hide
15,01but the fire came and boiled them out
15,01it boiled their ears, it boiled their snout
15,01they cried but no one heard them cry
15,01cause the people all had to die
15,01and no one knew quite why
15,01they just knew it was their time to go
15,01like we've been here far too long you know
15,01and so
15,01and so
15,01and so
15,01we go
15,01and welcome to the song
15,01you can play it right along
15,01on your acoustic guitar
15,01don't matter who you are
15,01just play the requiem for suicide
15,01and welcome to the song from the inside
15,01we've built our world as high as we could
15,01but it ain't no good
15,01we've looked for our purpose but never found
15,01so we gotta burn it to the ground
15,01and I'll shoot you if you walk on my mound
15,01cause this here dirt is mine
15,01you swine
15,01i killed the creatures who once dwelled
15,01their bodies in my hands I held
15,01I laughed because I won and their carcasses smelled
15,01so I buried them under my pile of dirt
15,01but if you try to see them you'll get hurt
15,01here I am with my shotgun
15,01not just one
15,01but two barrels of fun
15,01I'll shoot you twice and if I miss
15,01I'll beat you with the barrel and then I'll piss
15,01on your dead corpse and then i think
15,01I'll put you with the animals where you all can stink
15,01but I can't kill you first
15,01the bombs underneath my dirt will burst
15,01and even though we'll both be dead
15,01you won't get my pile of dirt.
