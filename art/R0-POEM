15,01Poetry

15,01Some say its the sonnet the lulls you to sleep,
15,01Some say its the ballad that makes hard men weep,
15,01Some say its the rhythm that flows with the rhyme,
15,01Some say its nothing more than a waste of time,
15,01I say its an outlet to free my frustration,
15,01I say its a messenger, my heart's delegation,
15,01I say its a doorway that leads into my mind,
15,01I say to you "enter, and see what you'll find."
